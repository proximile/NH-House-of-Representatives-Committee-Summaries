00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
is a relatively large division within
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so what i thought i would do is
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
um just give you a high level overview
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
of what
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
dehs is and then we're going to go
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
through later
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
this morning and into the afternoon each
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the bureaus
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that is where actually all of the
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
finances are are
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
within the bureaus they're not within
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
our division but i thought it was
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
important if it's okay with you all
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to start with just a division
 
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.469 align:start position:0%
um to start with just a division
overview

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
are you able to see my hand yes okay so
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
if there are questions throughout
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
your presentation i'll just raise my
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
hand i want you to go ahead and complete
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
your thought
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't need to be a hard
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt i just yep
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds good so can everybody
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
hear me okay
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes and i would like to give you a heads
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
up that i
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
i want to spend additional time more
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
than you probably planned
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
around the slides leading up to and
 
00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:12.629 align:start position:0%
around the slides leading up to and
including

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
the social determinants of health okay
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
that sounds good to me okay
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to get started um with
 
00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:23.909 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to get started um with
the

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
mission of the division for economic and
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
housing stability it's to advance
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
the economic the health economic and
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
social well-being
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
of individuals families and communities
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and our vision is that individuals and
 
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
and our vision is that individuals and
families

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're reading off of a
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
slide can we present her slide myself oh
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry should i be doing
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
no if it's fine if if if if you have a
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
slide deck we should be following
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
we just want to have the slide deck up
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
so we know what's
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
what's up you know what i'd kevin do you
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
have them or do you want me
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll do it i think you should be
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
able to share your screen if you have
 
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
able to share your screen if you have
them

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
yep i just have to um i'm sorry i was
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is just a little new doing it this
 
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
this is just a little new doing it this
way

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
um but i will pull them up right now
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
it really kind of works out great
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
because everyone knows exactly where
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're at
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
follow along it's really good it's fine
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
okay so now i'm gonna do screen share
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
and then i don't have to keep on saying
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
um why can't i
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
wait a second sorry okay
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
why is it not showing up well one second
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
technical difficulty here let me just do
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
it one more time
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
all right here we go dave i think dave's
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
gonna try to jump over i'm all set i got
 
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
gonna try to jump over i'm all set i got
it

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it helps to have dave in the
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
office next to me
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go to the next slide
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right all right so our mission um
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
which is not actually in statute or
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
rule um this is something that the um
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
division heads and i came up with um
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
about a year ago it's to advance the
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
health economic
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
and social well-being of individuals
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
families and communities
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
and and when we get to that point we
 
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.790 align:start position:0%
and and when we get to that point we
think

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
that our vision will be that individuals
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
and families are strong
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
resilient and thriving in their
 
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.710 align:start position:0%
resilient and thriving in their
communities

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the next slide shows you the
 
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
and the next slide shows you the
programs

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
and bureaus that we're going to talk
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
about within the division of economic
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
and housing stability
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
so that includes the bureaus of family
 
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.829 align:start position:0%
so that includes the bureaus of family
assistance

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
employment support somebody probably
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
should go on mute
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think maybe representative waller you
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
got some background noise
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
new heights the bureau of child support
 
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
new heights the bureau of child support
services

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the bureau of housing supports we also
 
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
the bureau of housing supports we also
have

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
comprehensive family support and family
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
resource centers
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development and head
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
start collaboration
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
and while the preschool development
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
grant is not a
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
department program it is something that
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
we are working on collaboratively
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
and through the university of new
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i just wanted to point that
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
out here
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
okay now all of those eight boxes
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
are divisions or bureaus is that correct
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
the preschool development grant is not
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
program that we work in collaboration
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
new heights is our i.t infrastructure
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
for this division and other parts of the
 
00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:58.710 align:start position:0%
for this division and other parts of the
department

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then comprehensive family supports
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
program so that's not a division and i'm
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to talk about
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of those programs here in this
 
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.670 align:start position:0%
a couple of those programs here in this
overview

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
all eight of those boxes uh receive
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
state funds or or some of them federal
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
funds only
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the preschool development grant is
 
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
so the preschool development grant is
100

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
federal um and that is the money is not
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
even with our
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
department it's with the university of
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and i believe
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
everything else which we will get to in
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
later slides has a combination of
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
federal and um
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay um so the
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
um our division our focus is we serve
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
individuals and families from
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
birth on through the life span our aim
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
is to really
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
provide a whole person whole family
 
00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.870 align:start position:0%
provide a whole person whole family
approach

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
we emphasize the importance of social
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
determinants of health
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
and the impact it has on an individual
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
and family
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
one of our goals is to really
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
focus on reducing programmatic and
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
system barriers
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
we we have a tendency to have
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
people fit programs not have the other
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
way around and programs fit people
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's some of the work we're
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get to
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
um we're really focused on strengthening
 
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.150 align:start position:0%
um we're really focused on strengthening
programs

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
organization and have be solution
 
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
organization and have be solution
focused

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
and shared um leadership and integration
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
so i have a question there okay the the
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
third bullet
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
about social determinants of health and
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
its impact
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
is that a statutory thing or is that
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
something the commissioner and you came
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
up with
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is something that we came up here
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
without the department
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
okay okay so
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
that um ties in really well into the
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
social determinants of health
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
and these are really kind of these are
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
known as the conditions in which people
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you oh
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
dave's helping me for some coffee now
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
and you're good exactly
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
i know i wish i could um so
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
um thanks dave are the conditions in
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
which people
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
are born grow live work and age and if
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
you look
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
at the social determinants of health
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
there are lots of things
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
maybe um that we wouldn't necessarily
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
think of when we think of the department
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
of health and human services yet
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
we touch all of these social
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
determinants of health in some way
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
within this division
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think we really try to look at
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
these when we
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
work do some of our work that if you
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
education children are ready to learn
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
well that impacts our bureau of child
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
development and head start collaboration
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
employment and income stability that
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
crosses our bureau of child
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
support bureau of family assistance
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
bureau of employment supports
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
health and well-being that's access to
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
housing stability we hear about that all
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
the time if a family
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
um isn't stable in their housing and
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
they're having
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
to move multiple um times that's going
 
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
to move multiple um times that's going
to

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
impact a family and so all and food and
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
nutrition so all of these pieces
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
um touch in some way on um
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
within our division of economic and
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
housing stability
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
so i have about eight questions on this
 
00:14:58.959 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
so i have about eight questions on this
slide

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
i hope i have any eight answers oh you
 
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
i hope i have any eight answers oh you
do

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
i hope so these are these are all
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
one-on-one questions for you
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay so graphically this
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
suggests and it probably doesn't mean to
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
but it implies that all of these
 
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.150 align:start position:0%
but it implies that all of these
determinants

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
determinants
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
are co-equal that they uh have an equal
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
balance and equal
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
importance and therefore an equal
 
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
importance and therefore an equal
prioritization

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
prioritization
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
within the department is
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that that's probably the wrong graphical
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
takeaway are there
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
are there priorities in here for what
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
your bureau is looking at so within
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
here um there's certain pieces that
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
this division does have an impact on
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
directly so that would be housing
 
00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:50.949 align:start position:0%
directly so that would be housing
stability

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
stability
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to hear a lot more
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
about that with our bureau of housing
 
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.829 align:start position:0%
about that with our bureau of housing
supports

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think employment and income stability
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to talk a little bit in
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
a little later about
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
some of our efforts for upward economic
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
mobility so i think
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
housing and employment as well as access
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
to health care
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition education it's hard
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
okay what are the pieces that are most
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
important because it all makes up a
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
person and a family and a community
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
but the pieces that we have the most
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
influence on i would say um
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
are food and nutrition kind of over to
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
housing stability if you're going
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
counter clockwise and then early
 
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
counter clockwise and then early
education

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay and then i don't actually see
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery on here but i think
 
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.790 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery on here but i think
you

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
suggested that it was under the health
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
and well-being that the healthcare
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
delivery system is somewhere in health
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
and well-being
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
yep i think that's their desired level
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
of physical
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
mental and emotional health and this
 
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.509 align:start position:0%
mental and emotional health and this
division

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't um doesn't have responsibilities
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
for the actual
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
health care service system we
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
um facilitate access to that so you'll
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
hear more
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
from henry lippman later when he talks
 
00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
from henry lippman later when he talks
about

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
the division of medicaid services but we
 
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.710 align:start position:0%
the division of medicaid services but we
partner

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
partner
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
very closely with medicaid because
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
people access medicaid
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then assistance see under well-being
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh emotional health so
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
that makes me wonder is that something
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to put into a database
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere so we can do population
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
management on emotional health
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to defer that to
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
when katya fox talks later
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
because she has the bureau of behavioral
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
health again these are
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
all aspects of someone's health and
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
well-being and we
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
focus on access to those programs
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
does that help well it does and i'll
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
just tell you
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you can tell from my
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions but i'm i'm really concerned
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
about the future of dhhs
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
managing or getting involved
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the totality of the social
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
determinants of health
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is a potential area of
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
massive scope creep um
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
to what the mission of dhhs was
 
00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
to what the mission of dhhs was
initially

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
thought to be um i
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
i very much am a big supporter of
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs having a direct
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
hands-on relationship to
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's healthcare provider
 
00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:53.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's healthcare provider
network

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
and as um as a human
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire i'm concerned
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
about these things
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
that are on this slide but i'm just
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
really concerned
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
about um a state entity thinking it's
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to manage
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
this on behalf of the population
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that could just be way too
 
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
and i think that could just be way too
interventionist

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
interventionist
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and so um so this is
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
so this is i'm not i'm not going to be
 
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.150 align:start position:0%
so this is i'm not i'm not going to be
hostile

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
hostile
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
but i am going to ask you a lot of
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
how much money are you spending in these
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
areas to do
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
more the distinction between monitoring
 
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.549 align:start position:0%
more the distinction between monitoring
status

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
and intervening to ensure the economic
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
stability of families
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's a gray area that we
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
really need to look at
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have responsibility for all
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
of these areas we need to understand the
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
social determinants of health and where
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
we intersect with those
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
and so when we're working with an
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
individual and
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
family it's important for us to
 
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
family it's important for us to
understand

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
do they have food and nutrition and can
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
we assist with access to that
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know are there employment
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities and
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
income stability we can assist with but
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for all of these
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
pieces these are
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
all of the things that make individuals
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
families and communities healthy
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
um and thrive and so we have certain
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
pieces of those but not
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
clearly all of them all right well thank
 
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
clearly all of them all right well thank
you

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's the beginning of a good long
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
conversation so so continue
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay dave is um doing something with my
 
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
okay dave is um doing something with my
computer

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is it's not coffee
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
though okay
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
are we okay was there too much showing
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that so okay
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay so a couple of the programs i
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on that
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
are not going to be highlighted so much
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the other
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
areas is family support we have
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
community service block grant and
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
whole families approach to jobs so
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
the first piece is our family support
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
and this is um we have comprehensive
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
family support
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is a um home visiting program that
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
is focused on strengthening parents
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
in an effort to reduce child
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and increase
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
child and family well-being this program
 
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
child and family well-being this program
is

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary it serves individuals and
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
families from birth on through the life
 
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
families from birth on through the life
span

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
span
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
and really what the focus is is trying
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
families when they say i need a little
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
bit of help with
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
parenting um in a preventative way so
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't need
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
more intrusive services later on through
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
more intrusive services later on through
dcyf

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
we also provide access to
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
family resource centers across the state
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
and those are primary prevention
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
services and many communities have them
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
um and they offer such services as
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
parenting education
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
workshops a place for families to go
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
when they're not sure where to turn and
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
access to services
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
and then finally we work very closely
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire children's trust
 
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.029 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire children's trust
fund

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they provide infrastructure support
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
quality designation and
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
support to the family resource centers
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to do their jobs
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
and a new program over the last i want
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
to say a couple of years
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
has been in the area of kinship
 
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
has been in the area of kinship
navigation

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
navigation
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
as some of you may be aware we have a
 
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
as some of you may be aware we have a
large

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
number of family members who are
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
either raising grandchildren
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
other family members and lots of times
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
some additional support and kinship
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
navigation is a way
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
to give those families access to
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
so that the children can remain with the
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
family and not need to be in foster care
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
through the division
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
for children youth and families
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
we also have the community services
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
block grant
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that those funds go directly to the
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
five community action agencies across
 
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:49.990 align:start position:0%
five community action agencies across
the

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and this is
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
federal dollars but it's really
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
um has an a focus to
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
reduce poverty um and so
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
the community action agencies are
 
00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
the community action agencies are
granted

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
the majority of those dollars for
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
direct service for infrastructure as
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
well as an
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop innovative
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
programs across
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
the entire family and finally
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
we um have the whole family's approach
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
to jobs parents working
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
on children thriving and representative
 
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
on children thriving and representative
walner

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
walner
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
actually has been very involved in our
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
efforts across the state with this and
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
an effort actually that um governor
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
an effort actually that um governor
sununu

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
um was is behind and really assisting
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
families to get out of poverty through
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
work at the same time supporting
 
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
work at the same time supporting
business

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
because prior to the pandemic we know
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's unemployment was
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
really low
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
but yet and there were families who are
 
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
but yet and there were families who are
receiving

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
public benefits um and some of those
 
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
public benefits um and some of those
families

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
weren't able to work because of this
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
um real phenomenon called the cliff
 
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
um real phenomenon called the cliff
effect

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
and what that is it's that's when a
 
00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
and what that is it's that's when a
family

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
an individual either starts to work
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
um is coming off of public assistance
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
but yet the benefits the loss of benefit
 
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.830 align:start position:0%
but yet the benefits the loss of benefit
the

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
increase in income does not match the
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
loss of benefits and families
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
actually end up being worse off
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
by working or taking a promotion
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
than not working and as a state
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things is we need as many
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
workers as we can as we move into the
 
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
workers as we can as we move into the
future

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
and also we know that a family that
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
has its own economic resources
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
is working in the long run is going to
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
be better for the individual the family
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
and the community as a whole
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so we've been partnering with new
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
to conduct an economic analysis to say
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay are there certain policy changes we
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
need to make
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
and how we administer benefits that
 
00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:15.909 align:start position:0%
and how we administer benefits that
enable

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
enable
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
people to work so that's some of the
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
work that we're
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
focusing on yep so
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has bureaus of uh
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
economic assistance and bia and
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
and there are other entities within
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
state government that worry about the
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
health of the economy
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so when i look at a dhhs slide
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
that says your mission includes creating
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
economic mobility pathways
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
that reads to me like something that is
 
00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
that reads to me like something that is
not

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the dhhs mission so
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
where so what what is in our mission
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
is um access to
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
let's say for example child care
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
scholarship which we're going to talk
 
00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.149 align:start position:0%
scholarship which we're going to talk
about

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
after this presentation so the child
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
care scholarship or temporary assistance
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
to needy families
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
as a department we set
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
the policy for those programs
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
and if the child care scholarship
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
the loss of that benefit makes it so
 
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
the loss of that benefit makes it so
people

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
don't want to work and then that impacts
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
other state departments that's what we
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
need to understand
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we can say maybe we need to change
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
the access to child care scholarship
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
so that it encourages more people to
 
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.669 align:start position:0%
so that it encourages more people to
work

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
and have people come off of unemployment
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not our responsibility
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
to do the employment pieces
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the business development but what
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
are the policies that
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
inhibit some of people coming to work
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
that is within our control that sounds
 
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.110 align:start position:0%
that is within our control that sounds
reasonable

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner i have a
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
question for you since your name was
 
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.710 align:start position:0%
question for you since your name was
mentioned

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
um so so i i've been concerned about
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
this cliff effect
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
where where people on who are on
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
public assistance who go into the
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
private employment
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
they lose so much in benefits it's not
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
worth the money that they make in the
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
in the job market and so i'm curious
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
what you know about previous efforts
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
to create sort of an incremental
 
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.669 align:start position:0%
to create sort of an incremental
stepwise

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
stepwise
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
approach so that there's a staircase
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
well i the the program that i could
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
speak the bet
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
most about is child care and in child
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
care there are
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are steps so a parent comes in
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
they are eligible for the program for
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the scholarship
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
um they come in a fee the parent fee
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
is um set according to their income so
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
let's say this is
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
someone just coming off public
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
assistance their income's very low
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
um they would have a low fee but as they
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
get a raise at work
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
then they pay more of their part and the
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
scholarship is less
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
and the parent pays more and there are
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
several steps
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
to work towards gradually having the
 
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.789 align:start position:0%
to work towards gradually having the
person

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
take full responsibility for uh paying
 
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
take full responsibility for uh paying
for

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
child care and no longer needing the
 
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.830 align:start position:0%
child care and no longer needing the
scholarship

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i think that's you know that's sort
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
of an example
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
there are there's work to be done in
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
that area but that is an example of how
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
sort of started to work on the cliff
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
effect and that
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
is why would you agree with that yes and
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
actually um i just was sending out the
 
00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
actually um i just was sending out the
draft

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
the final report um to the um committee
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
members and
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things they're recommending
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
yes as representative walner mentioned
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
steps throughout child care scholarship
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
but then when you get to the end it's a
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
really big drop um and i'm sure
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative walner um can attest to
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
that it is a big drop
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
and that's where families are really
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
struggling with do i
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
stay working do i take the promotion and
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the areas
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
where we really need to invest some of
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
time and energy to say do we have more
 
00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.269 align:start position:0%
time and energy to say do we have more
steps

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
steps
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are more gradual um than we offer
 
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
that are more gradual um than we offer
now

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
so if you need help with that i'd be
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
happy to help you with that because i
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
i it's a great concept i don't want to
 
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
i it's a great concept i don't want to
create

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
perverse incentives for people to stay
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
on public assistance
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think the emotional well-being of an
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
individual increases when they have a
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
job and they feel
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
productive so that is great and actually
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
interested i can actually send you the
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
economic analysis
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
once we have that for you to review
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
we with the partnership with new
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security we looked
 
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security we looked
at

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state 40 different communities in
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
town so we really try to get a diverse
 
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
town so we really try to get a diverse
representation

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the state so we're
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
really hoping it's going to help us
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
move some of this forward thank you
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
before you get going again there's been
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion here are there any
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members in
 
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members in
here

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any um you can get going
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
before i interrupt you again okay that's
 
00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:48.070 align:start position:0%
before i interrupt you again okay that's
fine

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
whoops okay
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay um so i just wanted to talk and i
 
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.430 align:start position:0%
okay um so i just wanted to talk and i
believe

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
that um dave weeders
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
who is on the line right now
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
did mention a little bit about the new
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
heights system
 
00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
and the new height system is
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
programmatically housed within the
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
division of economic and housing
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
stability and so we have
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
um an integrated eligibility
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
system which assists
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
with access to services for
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid child care snap
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
tanf access to long-term care
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a very robust
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
system that drives eligibility
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
for services within the department
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
through new heights we also have
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire easy which gives
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
individuals the access to
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
apply for benefits online and also
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
upload documents and do some different
 
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.789 align:start position:0%
upload documents and do some different
things

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
via an online portal any questions on
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
this right now
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
no i'm i'm kind of up on new heights
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right great
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
um good to know um and so
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
one of the complications of new heights
 
00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0%
one of the complications of new heights
um

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it's integrated which for the
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
consumer um is
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
is excellent there's lots of other
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
states that do not have integrated
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility systems
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
but what that means is that we have to
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
work with lots of different
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
federal authorities um when we are
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
working on any new heights changes and
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not just
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
medicaid it's also food and nutrition
 
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.549 align:start position:0%
medicaid it's also food and nutrition
services

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the administration for children and
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
families so
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
anytime we think about having to make
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
changes um with heights it
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
we can't if it's we can't just work with
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
one of our federal partners it's working
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
with all three of them
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
um which sometimes can make um
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
life a little more complicated i have a
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
couple questions here
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay and it may be mr waters needs to
 
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.270 align:start position:0%
okay and it may be mr waters needs to
answer

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
part of it but um so this slide implies
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
that all of these compliance
 
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.230 align:start position:0%
that all of these compliance
requirements

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
have been fully implemented and are now
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
fully supported
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that is that what this slide is
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to say
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
or are there some of these that are
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
still uh
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
tbd so i'm
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
my um we are in compliance with
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
all of these um areas um i do have lori
 
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
all of these um areas um i do have lori
snow

00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
snow
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
who's the administrator and dave weeders
 
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.270 align:start position:0%
who's the administrator and dave weeders
on

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
um this zoom if you would like more
 
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
um this zoom if you would like more
specific

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
questions well that's a good one okay
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
my next question and you don't know the
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
answer i'm sure is that we talked to
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh meredith tell us yesterday the day
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
before i've
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's all blurring together but um she
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
had some
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility uh system
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
requirements that would said that she
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
said would uh
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
simplify a tremendous amount of her
 
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.589 align:start position:0%
simplify a tremendous amount of her
manpower

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
manpower
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and i'm just curious
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you know where she is on the list of
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
of implementations so i um
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is what um
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
what meredith will do is she will
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
look at um pieces of
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the new heights data one of the things
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
that she's looking at
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
is video interviewing so that they
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
um don't have to go out into people's
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
homes and that's something that would be
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
built through heights but the other
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
piece is when
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
meredith's group looks at some of their
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
data integration some of that comes from
 
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.349 align:start position:0%
data integration some of that comes from
mmis

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
mmis
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
if they're looking at claims and things
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
i just i'm a little foggy i'd have to
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
look at my notes i thought she had
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
look at my notes i thought she had
another

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
a set of requirements for eligibility
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
management that
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
that were not yet implemented so i can
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
get back to you and find out exactly
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
what those may be is that okay
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
oh sure and that's over the next
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
few weeks don't hurry on that one okay
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
yep i will do that so
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
um eligibility requirements all right
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
i will um follow up on that definitely
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
anything else nope okay thank you
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
great um so this is
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
just a overview of the um
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
different bureaus within our division
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see bureau of family assistance
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
and employment on staff we have about
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
455 staff
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
and it's about 120 million dollars
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
bureau of child support is here the gray
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
circle that's 127 staff
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
our bureau of housing supports has five
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
and child development and head start
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration have
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
ten um the bureau of housing supports
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
which we're gonna hear about in two
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
bureaus from now
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um contracts out all services so that's
 
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:26.710 align:start position:0%
um contracts out all services so that's
why

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
they have the limited number of staff so
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
doing the math of the staff in my head
 
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.950 align:start position:0%
doing the math of the staff in my head
here

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that new hampshire has 1.3
 
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that new hampshire has 1.3
million

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
plus or minus and is there is there a
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
an external benchmark for how many
 
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
an external benchmark for how many
people

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
ought to be working these programs uh
 
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.349 align:start position:0%
ought to be working these programs uh
given

00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
population size so
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
by each program there
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
are certain benchmarks for the bureau
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
of child support and the same for family
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
assistance and employment supports and
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get into a little bit of that
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
when we um talk when we get into those
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
bureaus because for the bureau of family
 
00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
bureaus because for the bureau of family
assistance

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
we have um deadlines for timeliness
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
and um you know application um
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
error you know efficiencies and the same
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
with bureau of child support we have
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
very specific time limitations and so
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
there are some benchmarks which i can
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
get those for you i don't have those
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
i'm just writing myself notes there's a
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
question there
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
by representative wallner okay yes thank
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
you uh just while we're at this slide
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the staffing could you
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
um tell us how much a vacancy rate you
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
have at this point
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
i do not know that rebecca do you know
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
no i don't have that information on me
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
at this time i can get that for you
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
um we have um the one
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
thing um i know in the bureau of housing
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
support we have one vacant position
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
i know in child development head start
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration we have two
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and in the bureau of child support
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
family assistance and employment
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
supports when we did have the hiring
 
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
supports when we did have the hiring
freeze

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
freeze
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
the those workers were considered direct
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
care workers so for eligibility and
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
child support officers so they were not
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
part of the hiring freeze um but i can
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
get the actual vacancies for you by
 
00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:47.349 align:start position:0%
get the actual vacancies for you by
bureau

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
i was particularly wondering about the
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh bureau of family assistance
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's got 455 staff i wondered what
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
i can get that for you um probably by
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
the time we hit that um
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
presentation okay great thank you yeah
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
deb sorely if you're listening um
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren has a question
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay i can't see that
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay hi good morning thank you good
 
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.550 align:start position:0%
okay hi good morning thank you good
morning

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah could you mention the hiring freeze
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
could you please talk a little bit about
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.230 align:start position:0%
could you please talk a little bit about
that

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
the time frame how it affected your
 
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
the time frame how it affected your
department

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
where it is now sure
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so when we had the hiring freeze
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i honestly i don't remember actually
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
when it started
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
um to be quite honest with you um
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
we actually um in our
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
bureau of child support
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
family assistance and employment
 
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.270 align:start position:0%
family assistance and employment
supports

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
the frontline workers so for
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
family assistance that is the family
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
service specialist the person that
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
um an individual will meet with to get
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
access to benefits in the bureau of
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
employment supports that's an employment
 
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.109 align:start position:0%
employment supports that's an employment
counselor

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
and in child support it's the child
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
support officer
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
those positions were not part of the
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
so we were free um to go ahead and hire
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
those positions because
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
they were considered direct care which
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
was extremely helpful
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of these jobs are
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of these jobs are
entry-level

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
entry-level
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
jobs so you do have a higher turnover
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
but in the area of but in the in
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
family assistance we have a policy unit
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
that works
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
on policy to support some of our
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
programs those weren't considered
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
direct care so those positions were
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
frozen and so for a while
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
um and also our training unit we were
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
moving staff around trying to make sure
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know meeting all of our expectations
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
so all of those
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
have been lifted and we are actively
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
recruiting on those positions
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome are
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
there any other questions
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
i i have a question under the bureau of
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
family assistance
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
bureau of employment um
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you feel is about
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the right number of job descriptions you
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
have throughout that 455
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's that you probably have 10 different
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
job descriptions in there or
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
probably fss
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
one two three probably within
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
bfa i would say
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
there is probably around
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
10 or so um
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then employment supports there's
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
probably about
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
five or so one of the things the staff
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been working on the bureau chiefs
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
is when you have um certain
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
administrator positions they're a little
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
more generic
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the role of administering a program
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
and not so
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
program specific so that we can ebb and
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
flow so i
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
i can get you the exact number but i
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
would say probably about 10 to 15.
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
now what i'd really like here is um
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
an actual job description from for a
 
00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
an actual job description from for a
person

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
whose job it is is to engage
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
families engage clients a client facing
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
job description
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay great i will get that to you after
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay so some of our key accomplishments
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
um is that we've brought together
 
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.030 align:start position:0%
um is that we've brought together
multiple

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
program areas to form a division
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
with a focus on family strengthening and
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
upward economic mobility
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think one of this because this
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
division was formed
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
um in 2018 and so i think one of our
 
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.870 align:start position:0%
um in 2018 and so i think one of our
biggest

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
strengths has been we've been really
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
agile and nimble to meet the needs
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have led many collaborative efforts
 
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.870 align:start position:0%
we have led many collaborative efforts
across

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the department and new
 
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.069 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the department and new
england

00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
england
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
um with a real focus on being responsive
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
to the needs presented and
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
all of the different bureaus will talk
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit when we do
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
specific bureau presentations um
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
we've actually been yep
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
so as i as i read that i'm i'm i'm
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
my eye is catches family strengthening
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so that and since it's an
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
accomplishment it suggests
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's measurable and if it's measurable
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
that means somebody has developed a
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
baseline definition for what constitutes
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
family because if you don't have
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
criteria for what you think a strong
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
family is
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard to measure whether
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
or not you're making progress
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
so so i'm just i'm curious yeah i think
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's developed a definition on
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
what we consider the state view of a
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
strong family to be
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
so um i think there's a couple of
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
different measures
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
one of the measures we use is with our
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
comprehensive family support um
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
program which i mentioned earlier and
 
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
program which i mentioned earlier and
that

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
um is a preventative program
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and so one of the things we look at
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
is if a family we do this class of
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
data okay and so when we
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
have families who leave the program
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
we follow them for about three years
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we see did they end up in dcyf
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
needing dcyf services for a period of
 
00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
needing dcyf services for a period of
time

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
and um we track them for about three
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
years and so
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
when i look at the last three years so
 
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:24.870 align:start position:0%
when i look at the last three years so
for

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
people who left this program in 2018
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
89 of them continue to avoid
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
um dcyf services and so that's the major
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
measurement is whether or not they're
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
using dcyf services
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's one of the measurements another
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
measurement we look at
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
is how many people were we able through
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire employment program to
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
actually get
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
jobs um because that's going to help a
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
family to
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
care for its own family during the
 
00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:56.950 align:start position:0%
care for its own family during the
pandemic

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
one of the measures the um bureau of
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
employment supports looked at was the
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
number of people that they assisted
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
to obtain high school diplomas and so
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's a benchmark we look at so we try
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
to look across
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
all of our programs to see how many
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
families are we giving access to
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
are we assisting with child support
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
because that's helping to keep a family
 
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.349 align:start position:0%
because that's helping to keep a family
strong

00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
access to quality early childhood so we
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
look at a couple of different measures
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
look at a couple of different measures
across

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
all of our programs so so i'm just
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh the lines of delineation of
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility so
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
so moving people into employment i think
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
would be an accomplishment
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the division of of employment
 
00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.190 align:start position:0%
of the division of of employment
services

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i would think the number of people
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
graduating would be an accomplishment of
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
so so when i see a slide that says dehs
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments i i'm just curious
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
how um the actions and successes or
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
failures of these other departments
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
how how how they're viewed as
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
moving your mission forward yep so i
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
think it's and that's why
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
collaborate with these other
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
departments and divisions because
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
while yes somebody completing high
 
00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:22.470 align:start position:0%
while yes somebody completing high
school

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
is the response you know falls under
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
what we do is we assist with some of the
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
barriers that may be in the way of
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
somebody completing
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
on their education so through our tanf
 
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.670 align:start position:0%
on their education so through our tanf
program

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have barrier reduction services
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
through our
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
employment security our bureau of
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
employment support so that will help
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
with some of the cost accessing child
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
care an employment counselor to help
 
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.549 align:start position:0%
care an employment counselor to help
them

00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
get through and maneuver so we partner
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
with those programs and provide the
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
supports that somebody needs to be
 
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
supports that somebody needs to be
successful

00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay we have been actively involved with
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the council on thriving children and
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
the council for housing stability and
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're really hoping
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that some of this work will help
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
the state um and the department look at
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
alternate at ways for people to maintain
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
their housing
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
um and again we are moving forward with
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the economic analysis of the cliff
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
effect and that has been an
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
accomplishment because
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
we were working on it when the pandemic
 
00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:31.430 align:start position:0%
we were working on it when the pandemic
hit

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
hit
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
um and then um we you know
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
continued to have it evolve and grow um
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
through the um
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
and look from data that we collected
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic to help inform us
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah some of our
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
um challenges
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
are that there are siloed funding
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.790 align:start position:0%
are that there are siloed funding
streams

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
streams
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
is because that creates silos of program
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
delivery right
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
if if you're working in a program and
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
you see
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
that you only the funding
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know is for x but yet the family
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
really needs why
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
how do we help support that and so
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's really a challenge
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
the other piece that goes with that is
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
you typically end up with departmental
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
right i don't want to put words in your
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
mouth but i think that's coupled with
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
that right yeah interoperability of our
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
data systems
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that is a
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
challenge and then
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know workforce limitations right we
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
there's you know a limited workforce and
 
00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:55.750 align:start position:0%
there's you know a limited workforce and
so

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
um that also becomes difficult um
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
if we have you know um turnover um
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then also with our community
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
partners if they're having difficulty
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
um with hiring that also becomes a
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
challenge for us
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
my slide the lack of interoperable data
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
systems is probably an artifact of the
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
fact that the programs
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
started siloed to begin with right yeah
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and i think some of that is some of
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
the federal regulations and really
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
understanding what they are and working
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
with our federal partners
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
for us to figure out the best ways
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
from a family perspective because i
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
think there's nothing worse
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
than providing your information and
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
telling your story
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
multiple times and so how do we how do
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
we help families get around that to make
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know um every door is the right door
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
and while
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
i may not have all of the programs they
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
need how do i get them
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
to those programs in the swiftest amount
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we were asked is a
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
five percent
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease and so if we had an
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
increase we would really enable
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
new heights which is rit system
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
to enhance support for critical services
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're really
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
working on how do we have
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
people get what they need through
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
technology and so
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things that we can
 
00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.349 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things that we can
enhance

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
enhance
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
through our new heights in new hampshire
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
easy system as well as
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
support the field with technology
 
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.430 align:start position:0%
support the field with technology
enhancements

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be critical for our
 
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.790 align:start position:0%
so that would be critical for our
division

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
and then really continuing the work
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire children's trust
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're our facilitating
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
organization to really assist with
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
family resource centers which are across
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
provide families with access
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
to services when they need them and
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's a parenting class whether
 
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
whether it's a parenting class whether
it's

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
a play group
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to somebody saying
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
i'm having these struggles
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
how can you help me get some services
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
for myself or a family member
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that families can remain
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
strong in their communities if we
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
have a decrease then really new heights
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
will not be able to meet some of our
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
technology needs
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then also some of our work
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
to strengthen families will have to be
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
decreased and then
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean the needs go away right
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
it means that the needs will then show
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
up through dcyf
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
and so are there ways we can continue to
 
00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:02.230 align:start position:0%
and so are there ways we can continue to
provide

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
preventative supports when families need
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
them at the right place
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the right location so they can get
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
access to the services
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
they need so thank you very much for
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
it i i realize it's a new slide um
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
so what would make this even more useful
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
to the committee i think
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
is if you could take these and make them
 
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
is if you could take these and make them
more

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh specific in the sense that they they
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
might become
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say you know what the
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
impact of the
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
top yeah
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
sure can and i can get that to you after
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of a in a two-week
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
time frame kind of thing
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
yep that's fine think about it and give
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
us something
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
hard to where we say okay what are we
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
gonna get for our money
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds great thank you very
 
00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:58.630 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds great thank you very
much

00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the final piece is um and
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
we're gonna talk about these
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
um at in each bureau but i just wanted
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
to give you a high
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
level um of our division's prioritized
 
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.589 align:start position:0%
level um of our division's prioritized
needs

00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and again these will be talked about in
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
each of the bureaus because that's where
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the funding is
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
but these were our prioritized needs
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see they
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
vary um with child care it's our protect
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
and prevent
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
our quality system and then housing has
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of very specific
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
um prioritized needs um and then we have
 
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:38.950 align:start position:0%
um prioritized needs um and then we have
child

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
support and our family support
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
but again we'll talk about these um in
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
each of the bureau slides
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
so just relating this to the previous
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
slide it looks like some of these might
 
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.230 align:start position:0%
slide it looks like some of these might
be

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the increment side yes what would be
 
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.230 align:start position:0%
in the increment side yes what would be
measurable

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
measurable
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
now the zero dollars that means you
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
asked for it and the
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
governor's budget process zeroed it out
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah these were our prioritized needs so
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
yes we did not receive any of these
 
00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:11.589 align:start position:0%
yes we did not receive any of these
dollars

00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
did you get some of your prioritized
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
needs from the governor or
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
none of them rebecca i don't think we
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
got any of them did we
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
we did not get any representative
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um so in the columns up at the
 
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um so in the columns up at the
top

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
top
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
house bill was uh
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal year 22 house bill
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
1 with the fiscal year 22. so
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
way on the right side should that be
 
00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:00.630 align:start position:0%
way on the right side should that be
saying

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
a fiscal year 23
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you yes
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay thanks yeah
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
goodbye we all you know how many times
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
we reviewed this and i found a type uh
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
i neglected something on the next slide
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
deck i'm like oh but i already did the
 
00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
deck i'm like oh but i already did the
pdf

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
pdf
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i was like uh you look at things so
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
many times so
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
so okay this is uh this is useful uh did
 
00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.390 align:start position:0%
so okay this is uh this is useful uh did
you

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
um what what is this child support out
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
of state mileage how much
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
do we need to go out of state what is
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
this like
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
one trip a year is that ten trips a year
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
no it's really uh
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know one or two trips a year um and
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
in this past year
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
obviously with covid we haven't used
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
and so that would just be something for
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
next year and the in-state mileage is
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
really going to court and
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
um helping you know do their work
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
so if they're out of state how are they
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
still our responsibility
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
no no it would be like if somebody had
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
to go to a conference
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
oh child support out of state mileage is
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
not to support a child it's just
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
the training yes
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that no problem
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then the next slide is just some of
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
the areas in family support and bfa
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and we'll talk about all of those um
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
what is an empath membership
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
yep it is a professional association
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
that assists our employment support
 
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.109 align:start position:0%
that assists our employment support
counselors

00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
um with assisting people to
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
um who are on our tanf um temporary
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to needy families
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
come off of tanf through employment
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
one membership or is that like a group
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a whole group membership
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
um for like you know a whole
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
year and it supports all the staff on
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
with you know some conferences some
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
was there a question i'm no i'm saying
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
you can continue
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay um and and then um
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
this is just our staffing um and so
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
i just wanted people um this is just a
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
so this is it for the overview slide
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
so we were then going to move to
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development and
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
um head start collaboration if that's
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay with everybody
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's just do a sanity check
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
is this a mr ripple is this a good time
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
are there associated budgets that we
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
should dive into
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
from here or or do we need to see the
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
other slide deck before
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
this i think was the bigger picture
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
presentation i don't think there's a
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
budget associated with that one i think
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
we would move on is that right karen
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all right go on to the next
 
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.150 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all right go on to the next
one

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
so so as a time check i would like to
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
take a recess
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
in about 40 minutes 4-0
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
so um has anyone come up with a reason
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
recess then let me know
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead

it doesn't bother me one second
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%

is that can you see it all now yes thank
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
you chris
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
all right sorry oh my goodness okay
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'll get there
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay so this is our um bureau of child
 
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.710 align:start position:0%
okay so this is our um bureau of child
development

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
and head start collaboration
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
and if my cursor is not on the right
 
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.470 align:start position:0%
and if my cursor is not on the right
screen

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
so the mission statement
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the bureau of child development and
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
head start collaboration
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
is to partner with child care licensing
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
the head start community
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
department of education and others to
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that all children enrolled in
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
early childhood out of school programs
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
experience continuity in a high quality
 
01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:45.670 align:start position:0%
experience continuity in a high quality
setting

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
this statute is not um
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
and this is not in statute it is our own
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
um mission statement but we do include
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
it in our state plan that we
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
um apply that we have to um comply with
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
so the overview
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
is that we administer the state general
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
funds for child
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
care we provide
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
funds to eligible families for children
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
up to the age of 13 years
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
we work to recruit enroll
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
train and support child care providers
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the um
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
child care licensing unit which i
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
believe melissa saintsir
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
may have talked about on thursday
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
we also administer um
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
our child care development funds quality
 
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.190 align:start position:0%
our child care development funds quality
initiatives

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
we ensure we try to ensure that we
 
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.549 align:start position:0%
we ensure we try to ensure that we
partner

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
partner
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
with other quality initiatives across
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
we offer consumer education and
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
resources we provide access and
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
referrals for families
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we also work with school readiness
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
to ensure that children and child care
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
when they leave child care are actually
 
01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.910 align:start position:0%
when they leave child care are actually
ready

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
so our next slide these are the number
 
01:04:25.039 --> 01:04:25.349 align:start position:0%
so our next slide these are the number
of

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
children who receive child care
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship and you'll see that these
 
01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.549 align:start position:0%
scholarship and you'll see that these
numbers

01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
have been decreasing um over the last
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
and we are really trying to spend some
 
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.190 align:start position:0%
and we are really trying to spend some
time

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to determine um
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
why is the numbers decreasing some of
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
those numbers have to do
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
with the fact that people
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
are we have very low unemployment and so
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
people are working and they may be
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
making a little bit more money than our
 
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.309 align:start position:0%
making a little bit more money than our
scholarship

01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
allows for or um one of the other things
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we talked about a little bit
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
earlier is the cliff effect
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
because this is for people that are
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
working and if
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
if if the scholarship doesn't assist
 
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
if if the scholarship doesn't assist
enough

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
um with the cost of child care
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
then families aren't going to work and
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know and even if a family receives
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire child care scholarship
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
um they are still going to have some out
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
of pocket expenses and so
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're really
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
hoping to look at
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
um as we go through um all of our cliff
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
analysis child care is probably one of
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
of of areas to focus on
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
also in the past we used to include the
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
children who receive
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
protect and prevent dollars in these
 
01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:56.470 align:start position:0%
protect and prevent dollars in these
numbers

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
we used to use child care scholarship
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to support those
 
01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:01.990 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to support those
children

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
and those are children who are at
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
involved with the dcyf
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
or at risk of being involved with dcyf
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
and need preventative child care
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
but we move those children out of child
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
care scholarship
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
because once a family is in
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
this might be getting into way too much
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
detail so i apologize but i think it's
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
important to set the context is
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
if a family is eligible for child care
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
scholarship they're eligible for an
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
entire year week if their income changes
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
their circumstances change
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
we can't take a family out and so that
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
would be the same for the protect and
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
prevent child
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
care so it was better
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
fiscally for us to have those children
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
funded differently and not
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
have to meet the 12-month eligibility
 
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.589 align:start position:0%
have to meet the 12-month eligibility
requirement

01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
so a question about this is
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
any scholarships is this a mix of
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
of federal and state money and if so
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
what what portion is the state money
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
rebecca can you answer that question
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
sure it is a mix there's um
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
we have to match part of the grant
 
01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:17.829 align:start position:0%
we have to match part of the grant
dollars

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
to utilize all the grant dollars
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
um i just need to look to see
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
how much i believe it's about 10
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
million that is state general funds
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
maybe is it 26 federal
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
so we have about a 75 match somewhere in
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
there or a 25
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
we can continue as we go through these
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
where there are
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh clear programs and there's a match
 
01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:06.789 align:start position:0%
uh clear programs and there's a match
requirement

01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
it would be great to highlight exactly
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
what our match requirement is
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
and and you know where we are relative
 
01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.630 align:start position:0%
and and you know where we are relative
to

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh accessing the federal funds that we
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay and rebecca we do draw down the
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
federal funds first correct
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
um no actually we utilize the general
 
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.269 align:start position:0%
um no actually we utilize the general
funds

01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
um first okay so the
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
federal funds um total 16 million
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
and we have to match 10 million
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay so we have to come what is i can't
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
do math in my head is that about a 40
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
match requirement is that in the
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
in their rules percent
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
something um actually it's it's specific
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
to there's three parts of the child care
 
01:08:58.719 --> 01:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
to there's three parts of the child care
development

01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
fund um there's a mandatory that we have
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
to match
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's a matching piece
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
that we have to match and then there's a
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
discretionary piece that we do not have
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
so let's ask you this could you could
 
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.269 align:start position:0%
so let's ask you this could you could
you

01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh offline create a explanatory document
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
on some of these on the big programs to
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
help us
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
understand what the match rules are
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
and the extent to which we're we're
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of them
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
sure sure and i think too when we go
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
through the budget
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
the actual line items that might help
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
too but we can actually
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we can definitely do the um
 
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.630 align:start position:0%
yeah we can definitely do the um
document

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
great okay oh was there a question on
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
that sorry
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry this is a question by uh
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
actually two people
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
so let's go with uh representative
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
so um i heard chris i heard you say
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
that um one reason that we might be
 
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.310 align:start position:0%
that um one reason that we might be
seeing

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the child care numbers going down a bit
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
um obviously they've gone down
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic but um before that
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
when did we back out the uh protective
 
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
when did we back out the uh protective
preventive

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
preventive
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
um children out of these numbers
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
rebecca was that in 19
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
i believe it was state fiscal year 19.
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
and could you tell me how many um
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
children do you think that was
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
just just a ballpark of what the uh what
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the number was
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
i don't um have that
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
right here but let me see
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can get that for you representative
 
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
i can get that for you representative
walner

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
walner
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
um because i don't oh um we actually
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
i have it here um
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
but it's based on dollars not children
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
um so i can get that for you
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
great so to be literal there when you
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
say get that
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
for representative wallner i i think
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
what that means for our committee
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
is that somehow you all get it to mr
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
ripple and mr ripple
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes just just really briefly thank you
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
chris i can't
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and i it's the first
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
time actually
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
i had really realized that the um
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
protective preventive we're not we're no
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
longer in that
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
employ in that employment figure so it
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to know
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
the other question i wondered was i see
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
on your
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
chart you're talking about a monthly
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.390 align:start position:0%
chart you're talking about a monthly
average

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
do you do you keep um statistics i'm
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
sure you must
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
on the total number of children in a
 
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
on the total number of children in a
year

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
who benefit from child care scholarship
 
01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.669 align:start position:0%
who benefit from child care scholarship
because

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
some children may only for instance need
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
it in the summertime for a couple of
 
01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
it in the summertime for a couple of
months

01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
yes the number i it would be interesting
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
how many total children use um
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
get a child care scholarship in the year
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
that is something i believe we can get
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure okay yes we can get that to the
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee how is that
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much yep
 
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.030 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much yep
verve

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm just having
 
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm just having
a

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
difficult time understanding this
 
01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
difficult time understanding this
scholarship

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
are these distinct groups so i'm trying
 
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
are these distinct groups so i'm trying
to

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so what there's two different ways
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we fund
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
child care assistance one second though
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
now you're talking about funding which
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense to me but
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's these are talking about individual
 
01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:09.830 align:start position:0%
it's these are talking about individual
children

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
correct but we used to include because
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the children who receive protect and
 
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.830 align:start position:0%
the the children who receive protect and
prevent

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
dollars it used to be
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
paid for with our child care scholarship
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
so those children were included in the
 
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:26.229 align:start position:0%
so those children were included in the
monthly

01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
average and the yearly numbers but in
 
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.390 align:start position:0%
average and the yearly numbers but in
2019

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
we moved and stopped using child care
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay so those children were
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
included in those numbers
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
um and then we stopped doing that
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
um because of the funding the funding
 
01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:50.950 align:start position:0%
um because of the funding the funding
stream

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
stream
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay but the children were still getting
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
dollars to help in this
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely yes those children and
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
families and so i'm gonna get
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
um for the committee how many children a
 
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
um for the committee how many children a
year

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
we serve and protect and prevent thank
 
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
we serve and protect and prevent thank
you

01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome it does i apologize it
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
does get a little bit
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
um confusing i have a question about
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
the literal definition of the word
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship in this context
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay is this this is up to 13 years old
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
and this is this is this is money that's
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to date daycare providers to
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
to to to to to who for what
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah the scholars a scholarship to me is
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
specific money to help pay for academic
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
development and i'm just curious if
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's what it means here
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
it it it means it goes to um
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
child care providers that are either
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
licensed or licensed exempt
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
to provide child care
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the providers to cover
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
the cost a portion of the cost of the
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
child care services
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
so other states call it the child care
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
development fund
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire before my time chose to
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
call it the scholarship
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
program sure i get it
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a better sounding word so so
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
my my thought here is um
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
sort of an age range yeah like like
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
what percent i would imagine a much
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
bigger percentage of this
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
money goes to kids six and under than
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
seven and up yes you are correct maybe
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
85 90 is six and under
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
i can get you the actual breakout
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
because we do have it broken out i don't
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
have that handy
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
but yes i can get that for you and the
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
children that are in school it would be
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
after school care
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
school vacations and summer time
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay you're welcome
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay and kevin you write down all these
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
questions right okay i'm i'm trying to
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
do it and i'm like i'm gonna miss
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
something so
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
um that's super helpful um
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
and so the um programs that we offer
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
through this bureau
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
is um the child care scholarship program
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
um which we talked about a little bit
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
um the the quality dollars because we
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
use 12 of our
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
grant award has to be used um
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
for quality initiatives and so
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
that can be different ways professional
 
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.709 align:start position:0%
that can be different ways professional
development

01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
qris so there's a lot of different
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to assist with
 
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to assist with
quality

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
quality
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
we really try to provide resources to
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
the actual child care providers
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
we work with head start and early head
 
01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.709 align:start position:0%
we work with head start and early head
start

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
to really collaborate between those
 
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
to really collaborate between those
programs

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
head start early head start does provide
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
child care but they also provide
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
whole family support and other services
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
for eligible families and then new
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire connections
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
is actually our new child care system
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
database system that really assists with
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
families with child care providers
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
applying online paying for things online
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
billing online so we're really trying
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
to enhance our electronic capabilities
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the child care community
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
as an example when during the pandemic
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
there was a significant focus on
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
supporting child care
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
centers and child care providers to
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
operate and the department we
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office through
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
you know we got a lot of money out the
 
01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:10.630 align:start position:0%
you know we got a lot of money out the
door

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
door
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
to child care providers but we had to do
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
it in surveymonkey
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
excel documents because our data system
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't able um to meet the demand that
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
we needed and so we had to do a lot of
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
emails phone calling a lot of manual
 
01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
emails phone calling a lot of manual
processes

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits is we were able to
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
make some enhancements to our new
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire connections project
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
related to covid and now we
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
have a new 20 million dollar federal
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
award and all of the awards will be
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
generated through our it system new
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire connections and so
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
um that's going to be a huge benefit to
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
care providers as well as our staff
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
and finance staff processing um payments
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
so we take credit card payments for new
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire connections
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
well we wouldn't take a payment um it
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
for a provider to bill um for and then
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
for us to pay them
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
yep um
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
like we mentioned services are provided
 
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
like we mentioned services are provided
um

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
to children birth to age 13
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
we work with child care licensing
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
um very closely and head start and early
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
head start
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
provides 48 sites throughout the state
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that is done through the community
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
some of our accomplishments and this is
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
the one slide i realized yesterday i'm
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
like i didn't put our accomplishments
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
um is you know during the pandemic
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
um we kept child care open um
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
which was significant i think you know
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think businesses really realized how
 
01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.110 align:start position:0%
i think businesses really realized how
critical

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
child care is to the economy when all of
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
a sudden
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
schools were remote
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
we currently have 768
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
licensed program which allows for about
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
forty five thousand spots
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
we um stood up for emergency child care
 
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.550 align:start position:0%
we um stood up for emergency child care
programs

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
um we distributed 38 million dollars of
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
funds from gopher
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
and an additional 7 million dollars of
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
direct money for from
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
the cares act and then we also
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
implemented 14 emergency policies to
 
01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:44.229 align:start position:0%
implemented 14 emergency policies to
support

01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
families providers and children so for
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
example we allowed providers
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
on that bill for our ccdf scholarship to
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
go into disaster billing
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
which enabled them to bill regardless if
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
the child was there so it was based on
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
enrollment not attendance
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
because we knew that child care
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
providers needed that income
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
so that they could open again
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
once the economy started to reopen we
 
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.149 align:start position:0%
once the economy started to reopen we
also

01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
and we're still doing this right now we
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
have covet absenteeism
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
so when a child care center maybe has to
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
close a classroom
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
due to a covet exposure we're
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
paying for the cost of that service so
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
that families don't have to pay
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's been a huge
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
support to the child care field
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
throughout this time we've developed a
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
new data system
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
and what we really were able to do is we
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of this by working with
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the state of massachusetts because
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
they have um a um
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
a system that had a lot of the pieces
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to use and so we were
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
able to bar
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
lift and shift some of their codes which
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
saved us a significant amount of time
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
and money
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i think throughout this pandemic
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've been working very closely with our
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
other new england states
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
to really learn and partner in different
 
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
to really learn and partner in different
ways

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then we continued to
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
provide professional development
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
with um in partnership with the
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
um using some of the preschool
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
development grant dollars
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
and um we've added new credentials to
 
01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
and um we've added new credentials to
about

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
just over 300 um early childhood
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
providers so we're continuing
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
to provide professional development
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
some of our key challenges
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think we all knew
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
or many of us knew in the field that
 
01:22:59.040 --> 01:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
or many of us knew in the field that
child

01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
care is relatively fragile
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
it is it's not
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's expensive um and so
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and oftentimes families may not have
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
care at the right location at the right
 
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
care at the right location at the right
price

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so i think the pandemic really
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
showed us how fragile that system really
 
01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:23.669 align:start position:0%
showed us how fragile that system really
is

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
and so one of our challenges is
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
as well as um the silver lining of covid
 
01:23:30.159 --> 01:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
as well as um the silver lining of covid
is

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay how do we go back once we're post
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic but not going back to the way
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
because the way it was was not meeting
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of business and families and
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so how do we increase
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
partnerships at a community level um
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can really meet the needs of
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
those communities and how do we partner
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
with business
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
differently i think business found how
 
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
differently i think business found how
critical

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
child care is to their operations so are
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
there ways we can
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
partner with businesses and have child
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
care centers partner with businesses so
 
01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
care centers partner with businesses so
maybe

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
they assist with some of the costs for
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
the families that
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
um that are their employees or they
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
support some of the needs of child
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
care um so it also had showed that
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know there needs to be um
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
more care in infant toddler and family
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
child care i think
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
um what families found is smaller
 
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
um what families found is smaller
settings

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
settings
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
really are meeting the family needs
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
better and so how do we support that and
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
expand that as we
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
um come out of the pandemic um
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
also um workforce challenges
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
there was a ch and you're going to
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
probably hear this across the board with
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
um some of the direct care workforce
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
challenges which is included in child
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
care they have traditionally low wages
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's older workers and so
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
how do we address workforce challenges
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the industry and then a challenge is
 
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.350 align:start position:0%
for the industry and then a challenge is
also

01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
continuous quality improvement it's
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
really hard
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes for child care
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
providers when
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
they have really long hours really long
 
01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
they have really long hours really long
days

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and limited staffing how do they then
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
make the time for
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
staff development and continued um
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
staff improvement so those are some
 
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.030 align:start position:0%
staff improvement so those are some
challenges

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
within um the child development world
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so some of our quality standards um
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
was that um you know for we have to
 
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
was that um you know for we have to
provide

01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
um a certain amount of all of
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
our quality standards um and
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have to for based on the dollars we
 
01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
we have to for based on the dollars we
spend

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
we actually have to target some quality
 
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.669 align:start position:0%
we actually have to target some quality
dollars

01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
um for infant toddler um
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
and um general quality and so
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
can we skip this slide and i'll tell you
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
why okay
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is the first slide like
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
this in
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the decks that we've seen so far yeah
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
and this is potentially one of my
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
favorite slides
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
of all okay to associate the workload
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
and the quality standards this way
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
and as i've looked at this slide trying
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
to just figure it out intuitively
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
it makes my head hurt so okay i'd like
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
to talk to you offline about this if we
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
could just so
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
i could really understand there's a
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of potential meat
 
01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:45.510 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of potential meat
here

01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
so okay and and that's great yep we can
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i think it was kind of
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
different programs have it differently
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
so um i'm sorry if it made your head
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
hurt but we can talk
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
about it okay great thank you
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
information in my head
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
um so this is just an overview of the
 
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.110 align:start position:0%
um so this is just an overview of the
budget

01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
um with the mix from 2018 to our
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
current request with um federal funds
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
and general funds the
 
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
these accounting units do not have any
 
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.229 align:start position:0%
these accounting units do not have any
of

01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
any other funds it's either federal um
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
or general and you'll see that the
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
are the majority of the funds in this
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
program and we'll go through it line by
 
01:27:32.239 --> 01:27:34.070 align:start position:0%
program and we'll go through it line by
line

01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
um okay anything on this one okay
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
um if we had increases
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
we would increase support for continuous
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
quality improvement
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
we would actually potentially look
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
to expand access to programs that could
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
be more
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
steps for child care scholarship it
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be a higher income
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
threshold which would give families more
 
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
threshold which would give families more
access

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
and really we would look at how do we
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
address some workforce short
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
workforce shortages we are working with
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
other programs um within our department
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
so the bureau of child development
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
is working closely with our bureau of
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
employment supports to say
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
how do we assist some people who may be
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
on tanf who have a work requirement
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
can we do some training to get them into
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
child care and the same with new
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
how do we um tap into some of their
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
workers who may need a different job
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
so how can we do some of that to address
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
workforce shortages
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
and then really conversely if we had a
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
decrease some of those same areas are
 
01:28:56.159 --> 01:28:57.110 align:start position:0%
decrease some of those same areas are
areas

01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
um that we would not be able um to
 
01:28:59.679 --> 01:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
um that we would not be able um to
support

01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
so my comment is similar to the other
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
slide like this
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is a really great
 
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.390 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is a really great
start

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
but if you could uh spend some time
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
how this is could be measurable so that
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're telling us exactly what we're
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
buying or foregoing
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
sure not a problem
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
these are all directionally useful but
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
more specifics on the what would help
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
not a problem um and then these are the
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
just the different accounting units
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
um that we will be going over
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
i think right now so
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
so this is where i'd like to uh recess
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
um um but
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
i hate to do it because we're probably
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
what 20 minutes from being done
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
rebecca i
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
i could be a little longer is it just
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
these four accounting units or does this
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
go on to a second page
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh no it's just these four okay it kind
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
of depends on
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so i need to i need to step away and
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
because we're so close to the
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
finish um hey
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf are you
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
are you ready to step in and i'll step
 
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
are you ready to step in and i'll step
away

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
talk later this afternoon about what i'm
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
missing on the accounting
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate it the the big thing i
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
noticed when i look at the spreadsheet
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
is it seemed like there were several
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
accounts where there were no general
 
01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.669 align:start position:0%
accounts where there were no general
funds

01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated or in the governor's budget
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
and what the issues are there but
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you so i'm going to
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
step away
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
and uh representative erf is now the
 
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.470 align:start position:0%
and uh representative erf is now the
chair

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
great and i'm going to turn this over to
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
rebecca just tell me what the first page
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
great so the first one there is 29.76
 
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
great so the first one there is 29.76
which

01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
is uh yeah yes towards the bottom here
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that goes on to page 950.
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
and to the chair's earlier question this
 
01:31:59.120 --> 01:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
and to the chair's earlier question this
is

01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a mistake that there are not
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
general funds here
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no questions there i'll
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
move on to
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
2977 which starts at the bottom of the
 
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
2977 which starts at the bottom of the
page

01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
child development program which is of
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
course the bulk
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
of this area so here i do have a
 
01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
of this area so here i do have a
question

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if the
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in general funds which appears
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be made up in
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds is that the result is are
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
these funds covered related here
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
by chance or is this match related what
 
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
by chance or is this match related what
what

01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
explains that nice benefit to us
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure rebecca i'm sorry what line are you
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
the reduction in general funds from
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
21 budgeted to 22 and 23.
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the in the county unit 29.77
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
correct um in the biennium that we're
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
there was um several initiatives that we
 
01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.229 align:start position:0%
there was um several initiatives that we
were

01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
we had to modify our system for um as
 
01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:11.510 align:start position:0%
we had to modify our system for um as
well

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
to align with the federal regulations
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
and there was
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
additional general funds given to the
 
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
additional general funds given to the
this

01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
division to implement those
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like additionally there was
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars of general funds
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
that we had to add to this budget i
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
i happen to remember that 564 was
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 2 million
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
for 2020 and that's the protect and
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
prevent that's children in dcyf care
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
that need to be paid
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
with general funds um and
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's a you know a lot of work that's
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
being done in the dcyf system so we're
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
continuing to budget that at two million
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
dollars so that
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
that one would be a million dollars in
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
general funds that that increased in
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 there
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay but what i'm really looking at is
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
between the current year
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
you have 20 million 21 million in
 
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.149 align:start position:0%
you have 20 million 21 million in
federal

01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
and the next year you have
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
this goes on to 16 million but on the
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
other hand the general funds which were
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
15 million this which are 15 million
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
also go down to 11 million are those
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
why is that going that's a good question
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
this biennium we've received for
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
um is sb i believe 570 we had received
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
funds to modify the system so that we
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
could get
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that population included in the
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
child care
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
there was some other
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
i think it had to do with the
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
absenteeism we had to change the way
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we were calculating that to provide
 
01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.229 align:start position:0%
that we were calculating that to provide
more

01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
absent days there was
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
i know there was a there was a couple
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
other initiatives that we had worked
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
on for um they kind of surrounded the
 
01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
on for um they kind of surrounded the
system

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
so there was more dollars given to us i
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
believe there was like
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
five things um so were those
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
were those numbers originally budgeted
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
or were those numbers
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
because you got more funds like covet
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
funds or something
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
no those the general funds were budgeted
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
they were given to us
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the house phase okay um last
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
biennium it took us a little
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
longer to implement some of the things
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
due to covid
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
um and we had other dollars to utilize
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i believe we used the
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
federal funds from some of that um
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that would not be reflective here
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
any coveted dollars
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative wallner
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um rebecca i
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about the
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
the drop in um
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
allocation here in 22 and 23
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
from back to our actual
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures in 2020 i mean we're
 
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
expenditures in 2020 i mean we're
showing

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
showing
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
a total funds reduction of about five
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars that would be five
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars in services
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
and last week there was a bill over in
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe you did uh you did a um
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note for that bill
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
and actually you were showing that
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
um it was closer to 33 million
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
per year that was needed for child
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
care than it was to 28 million
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if maybe um at some
 
01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:43.430 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if maybe um at some
point

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
you prepare for this division
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
um like a sort of a fiscal note about
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
this particular these particular lines
 
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
this particular these particular lines
and

01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the one that you did
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 144
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could prepare something
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
for this division so you could see
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
how you get to um the 33 million as
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to 28 million
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
what i'm worried about here is that if
 
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.189 align:start position:0%
what i'm worried about here is that if
we

01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
bring this line down and we end up
 
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
bring this line down and we end up
having

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
particularly when the pandemic hopefully
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
lessens and people are going back to
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
work kids are back in school
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
and people really need child care needs
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
are going to increase
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll be needing more child care
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and this what's in the budget at this
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
point looks like we'll be having less
 
01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
point looks like we'll be having less
available

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we risk a waiting list at some point
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's really a goal
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
here is to have a waiting list in child
 
01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.189 align:start position:0%
here is to have a waiting list in child
care

01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
so i wondered if you could prepare
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
something that would help us
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
um did you want me to speak it all
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
to anything or just um bring you
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
something back
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
well i think it would probably be
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
helpful i because i am sitting here
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note from
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 144 and everyone else
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that in front of them so i
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be good if at some point
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the next when we're not finalizing
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
anything today so
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
if we take some time with this page at
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
some point in the near future and you
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
kind of walk through something like what
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
you did here
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
for 144 does that make sense

it
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%

2978 which is child care development
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
quality insurance
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
which is basically all federal funds
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
all right then moving on to 2979 which
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%

i i just want to let everyone know that
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i received a request yesterday uh
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
regarding a couple of our committee
 
01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
regarding a couple of our committee
members

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
being unable to participate fully on the
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
2nd of march
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's an important day because we have
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
dcyf that day
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple who for some reason was
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
doing work email at 10 o'clock at night
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
told me that he thinks we can work it
 
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.669 align:start position:0%

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%

01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
completely free up
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%

01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
jam a couple of uh days before then to
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be comfortable with that so
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%

02:24:54.840 --> 02:25:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
so we we apparently run a better meeting
 
02:25:37.359 --> 02:25:38.150 align:start position:0%
so we we apparently run a better meeting
because

02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill i was supposed to talk about
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
at 11
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
15 still hasn't come up
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they've got one more bill before
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
they get to it
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to have a second
 
02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:52.150 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to have a second
computer

02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
computer
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
looking to see the progress of that
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
oh i may cut away for eight to ten
 
02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:04.830 align:start position:0%
oh i may cut away for eight to ten
minutes

02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
fine

02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
so so ms rounds
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
on that on that one slide with
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
um the the workload benchmarks and the
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
quality benchmarks
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
yes i really am excited about the
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
potential for that slide
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay and so if we could if we could
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
schedule a meeting
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
um that meets all of our schedules i i i
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
would like to spend like 30 minutes
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
going through that
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
in depth uh exploring its potential
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
for other areas so i i
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming um mr ripple you
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and miss san nello would want to be
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
on that call
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to be on it yes i don't know
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
about anybody else
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think chris might um have some of her
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
staff joined as well but i
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
i do not necessarily need to be part of
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
all right and if you're ready we will go
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and nice misspoke before the break
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
i said there are four presentations left
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
there are three
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
all right well um uh
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna reconvene uh division
 
02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:43.590 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna reconvene uh division
three

02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of recess uh continuing on
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
with the division of economic and
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
housing stability
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
so take it away you're
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
dave was helping me and i couldn't find
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
where my controls went so thanks dave
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me now yes all right
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
i hope everybody had a nice little break
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to go ahead and get
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
started with our bureau of housing
 
02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:25.190 align:start position:0%
started with our bureau of housing
supports

supports
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
if that works for everybody um
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
so this is led by melissa hatfield and
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
rebecca lord and again as our finance
 
02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:40.309 align:start position:0%

problem
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
and not being able to find my copy of
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%

um but i'm i'm i'm i'm struggling to
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
find my copy of your slide deck
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
all right and then if they're is this
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
all three of them in this one slide deck
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
or are there three slide decks
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
three slide decks okay all three would
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
be wonderful i don't know why
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
i can't find them i'm sorry that's okay
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so here um we have the
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
um number of people served for the last
 
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
um number of people served for the last
um

02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
four years um and so
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
the um the purple line is the total
 
02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.670 align:start position:0%
the um the purple line is the total
served

02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
served
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the state through this bureau and
 
02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:03.349 align:start position:0%
in the state through this bureau and
then

02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
we break it out by the different
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
programs the yellow is shelter
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
and then prevention services and then
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
our continuum of care dollars and then
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
our emergency solutions grant
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we actually um
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
have refined how our some of our
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
services are provided so you'll see that
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
we weren't tracking the esg services or
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't have them back in 2013
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
and so the continuum of care i'm going
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about all of these services but
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
that the majority of the services end up
 
02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
that the majority of the services end up
in

02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
prevention or within the shelter service
 
02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:51.990 align:start position:0%
prevention or within the shelter service
system

02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
the annual point in time some of you may
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
have heard about this
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
and this is actually what's done each
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
year the
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
hud the housing and urban development
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
requires states to conduct a point in
 
02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.389 align:start position:0%
requires states to conduct a point in
time

02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
count every year in january
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
and hud picks the date in january and
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
housing programs continuum of care
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to go out and physically count
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
people who are experiencing
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
um homelessness and so
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
this past year um we just did it january
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
i want to say
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
27th and we don't have that data yet it
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
was actually a little complicated due to
 
02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:39.030 align:start position:0%
was actually a little complicated due to
covid

02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
but you'll see this here in in january
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
of 2020 the total number of people
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness was at six
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
1675. and
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
um the blue line is
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
um the 1327 that
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
those are people in shelters um who are
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
considered homeless
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then the total on and then people
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
that are unsheltered is
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
348 so that was individuals who
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
were not in shelter they weren't
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
doubling up they may have been in a tent
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
um or living in their car and that is
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay some of the programs that we have
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
under the bureau of housing supports is
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
we have our programs that are
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
done in conjunction with the us
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
department of housing and heart
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
urban development which is known as hud
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
we have our balance of state continuum
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to talk about that on
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and those projects provide permanent
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
support of housing
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
rapid rehousing and coordinated entry
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
we also provide emergency solutions
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
grant which is homeless prevention
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
and rapid rehousing so it's taking
 
02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:06.309 align:start position:0%
and rapid rehousing so it's taking
people

02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
who are homeless and quickly getting
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
them into
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
some form of sheltered and then we have
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
a small on program
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that is the housing opportunities for
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
people with aids which is known as hopwa
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that's really short and long-term
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
rental assistance
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
we have our emergency shelter program
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
which is non-permanent temporary shelter
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
so um that's for people who have no
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
other housing options
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
they'd otherwise be sleeping in a place
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's not meant for human habitation
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
and and what emergency shelter is really
 
02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.630 align:start position:0%
and and what emergency shelter is really
focused

02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
focused
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
on meeting the basic needs of each
 
02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
on meeting the basic needs of each
person

02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
and that is outlined in rsa 120
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
6a and then we have a
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
program yep sorry so that's all right
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative earth has his hands oh
 
02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i couldn't see
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
i have too many screens going here sure
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's my job to look for okay thank
 
02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
okay it's my job to look for okay thank
you

02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
going back to the previous slide
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
the annual point in time yeah
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
so unique that was january of 2020 i
 
02:35:20.479 --> 02:35:21.429 align:start position:0%
so unique that was january of 2020 i
believe

02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
correct pre-covert i believe correct
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty substantial jump like a
 
02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty substantial jump like a
20

02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
increase in at a time when our economy
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
was booming can you
 
02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
have an explanation for what was going
 
02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
on there sure so
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
um what there's a couple of things that
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
are going on there
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um first of all is we're getting better
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
and better with our counting
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so in january of 2020
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bureau of housing support did a lot
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
of work
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
with all of our outreach providers with
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
the other two continuum of cares to get
 
02:35:54.479 --> 02:35:55.030 align:start position:0%
the other two continuum of cares to get
really

02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
accurate counts and so we've been
 
02:35:57.680 --> 02:35:58.710 align:start position:0%
accurate counts and so we've been
spending

02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
spending
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
a better time on collecting our data and
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
making sure we're counting
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
every person so there was a huge
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
emphasis on
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
we need the accurate count so that's one
 
02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:11.429 align:start position:0%
we need the accurate count so that's one
piece

02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
piece
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the second piece and i'm going to
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
talk about it a little bit is
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
while the economy is great the housing
 
02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.309 align:start position:0%
while the economy is great the housing
stock

02:36:20.309 --> 02:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
stock
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have a lack of housing stock in the
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the vacancy rate i want to say is at
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
like 1.8 percent
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
the median rent is
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
um i think thirteen hundred dollars um
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
a month and so housing is out of reach
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
for many individuals we actually have
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
are working and living in shelters um
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
because they can't find a place to rent
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
so those two pieces go in hand in hand
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome um and then
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
right here oh sorry i still don't have
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
this presentation
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
mr ripley i i don't know if it's me but
 
02:37:06.319 --> 02:37:06.790 align:start position:0%
mr ripley i i don't know if it's me but
i

02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't think i have this presentation
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think i think it is in the email that
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
i just sent you i think it's the one
 
02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
i just sent you i think it's the one
label

02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
label
 
02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay i checked those three and i
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
none of those when i open them they they
 
02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't say that so
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
did you just you did just receive an
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
email from me though a few minutes ago
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
though right
 
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:39.280 align:start position:0%

02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
none of those are the ones
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
she is sharing i have three you sent
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
from yesterday however
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
she's on a different deck i think i
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
think the one i just sent you looks like
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
it has six presentations attached
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully they all attached and i there
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
should be one
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
oh you know what because i only see the
 
02:37:57.439 --> 02:37:58.469 align:start position:0%
oh you know what because i only see the
three

02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
i don't see the bottom i don't see the
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
bottom ones
 
02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
you need you need a dave wieders in your
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
house like i have
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
i do i do all right so
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
so that's just me not knowing how to
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
work a an email
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's okay okay
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna can i continue yes ma'am
 
02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
sorry for the interest no it's fine no
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
no no um and so
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
finally the other program we have is
 
02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:27.510 align:start position:0%
finally the other program we have is
through

02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
samhsa which is substance abuse mental
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
health services and administration
 
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that funds our assistance
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
our path outreach and that's for
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who have
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness and this is a
 
02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness and this is a
small

02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
um pot of money um and so we get 300
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
000 a year from samhsa and the services
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
are provided by
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
six community mental health centers and
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to take a quick second to
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the continuum of care
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
because um it gets that's a little bit
 
02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:10.150 align:start position:0%
because um it gets that's a little bit
um

02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
confusing sometimes because the
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
continuum of care is federal dollars
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it's the goal is to
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
assist individuals who are experiencing
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
homelessness to provide services to move
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
into transitional and permanent housing
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the goal is long-term stability and
 
02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
and the goal is long-term stability and
so

02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has three different
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
continuum of care
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
we have greater nashua which is nashua
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
and six or seven surrounding communities
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
we have manchester um which has its very
 
02:39:50.399 --> 02:39:50.790 align:start position:0%
we have manchester um which has its very
own

02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
continuum of care just for the city of
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
manchester and then we have the balance
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
of state
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
which is the bureau of housing supports
 
02:39:58.960 --> 02:39:59.429 align:start position:0%
which is the bureau of housing supports
what's

02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
what's
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
important to know is each
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
continuum of care receives its funding
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
directly from
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
hud and we cannot um
 
02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
dollars can't cross boundaries for this
 
02:40:15.190 --> 02:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
stream of funding
 
02:40:18.469 --> 02:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
and so um the goal of the continuum of
 
02:40:18.479 --> 02:40:19.030 align:start position:0%
and so um the goal of the continuum of
care

02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
is community-wide planning
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
to address homelessness improve
 
02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
to address homelessness improve
coordination

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
and each community gets to tailor its
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
program to the strengths and challenges
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
within that community
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
and you'll see here that the balance of
 
02:40:35.439 --> 02:40:37.429 align:start position:0%
and you'll see here that the balance of
state

02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire we got 4.7 million
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
dollars for the balance of state
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
on and that is managed by the department
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
and that is included in one of our
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
budget um
 
02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
pieces but i just wanted to point that
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
out i have a question on this slide
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
right um so when hud
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
sends us the money do they send it with
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
the housing first
 
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions so what hud does
 
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
is they um have a goal of housing first
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we so that's that that's a
 
02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:12.790 align:start position:0%
um and then we so that's that that's a
yes

02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh so if they do can we ask for
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
a waiver so that at the discretion of
 
02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.309 align:start position:0%
a waiver so that at the discretion of
dhhs

02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
we can waive the housing first
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
and what would we want can i ask why
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
we'd want to do that
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
because as i understand housing first
 
02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
because as i understand housing first
it's

02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
it says that if you have a a congregate
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
living situation where uh somebody
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
is um abusing drugs
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
and is the bad apple spoiling the whole
 
02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:44.389 align:start position:0%
and is the bad apple spoiling the whole
bunch

02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
bunch
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
and jeopardizing the sobriety and
 
02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:47.670 align:start position:0%
and jeopardizing the sobriety and
stability

02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
stability
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the other people in the congregate
 
02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
of the other people in the congregate
living

02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
living
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
that the federal housing first program
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
insists that you leave that bad apple
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
amongst the others
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
and when when it may be tough love
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
but you got to get the bad apple out of
 
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
the barrel
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
so that the other people can survive and
 
02:42:06.319 --> 02:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
so that the other people can survive and
thrive

02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
so it seems like a good intended
 
02:42:14.469 --> 02:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
program that can actually do more harm
 
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
than good and i'd like to
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
give you the option of waving it when it
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the so there's a couple
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
problems with that first of all hud um
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
releases funds based on housing first as
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
a priority so
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
if that if we were to say that we would
 
02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:35.670 align:start position:0%
if that if we were to say that we would
lose

02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
lose
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
critical federal funding because we
 
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
would lose
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
points on our applications i think
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
while we have housing first as a
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
goal you know there also are regulations
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
laws and rules that individuals must
 
02:42:52.479 --> 02:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
laws and rules that individuals must
follow

02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
when accessing services so i'd be happy
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
to talk with you
 
02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
offline about this particular situation
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
you might be talking about to see
 
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
um if we can clear some of that up okay
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay um so this is the delivery
 
02:43:14.479 --> 02:43:15.429 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay um so this is the delivery
system

02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you'll see we provide services
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
statewide and we have a number of
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
providers that we contract with and some
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
of these
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
providers provide multiple services
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so but i broke it out by the
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the accomplishments that we
 
02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:39.590 align:start position:0%
um one of the accomplishments that we
have

02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
um through this past year a couple of
 
02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:43.269 align:start position:0%
um through this past year a couple of
years

02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
we actually really have implemented a
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
for the balance of
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
state so i just want to be clear this is
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
for the balance of state but we
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
implemented a coordinated entry process
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
that standardizes access for individuals
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
who are at risk of homelessness
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
and experiencing homelessness this has
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
really helped
 
02:44:08.230 --> 02:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
individuals and families access housing
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
services that they need
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it also enables us to prioritize
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
those who are the most
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:22.429 --> 02:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
also in fiscal year
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
2019 we were awarded
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
three new programs rapid rehousing for
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
statewide community entry service system
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
for survivors of domestic
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
and sexual violence and we were able to
 
02:44:38.399 --> 02:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
and sexual violence and we were able to
expand

02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
expand
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
permanent supportive housing in the
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
north country so we really tried to
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
target areas that there were gaps in the
 
02:44:45.359 --> 02:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
target areas that there were gaps in the
state

02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and how we could target that and through
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
the work with the council on housing
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
stability we're partnering on
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
submitting a 1915 i medicaid state plan
 
02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:58.389 align:start position:0%
submitting a 1915 i medicaid state plan
amendment

02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
and this will enable individuals who
 
02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
are experiencing homelessness that have
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
serious mental health diagnosis
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
or substance use disorder um obtain and
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
maintain permanent housing
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
so we're still finalizing that actual
 
02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:15.670 align:start position:0%
so we're still finalizing that actual
submission

02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
submission
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
but this will be a way to provide access
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
to individuals
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
um to maintain their housing which we're
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
really excited about
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then we also are looking at creating
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive case management model
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
that follows the person throughout the
 
02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
that follows the person throughout the
process

02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
of experiencing homelessness or housing
 
02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
of experiencing homelessness or housing
instability

02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
instability
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
so if somebody starts an outreach goes
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
into a shelter and then we can move
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
into permanent supportive housing the
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
case management will follow the person
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
and connect them with the necessary
 
02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:50.469 align:start position:0%
and connect them with the necessary
services

02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then finally we have partnered with
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
our public housing authorities and we've
 
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
expanded voucher programs in new
 
02:45:58.160 --> 02:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
expanded voucher programs in new
hampshire

02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
so the first one was mainstream vouchers
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
which provides rental assistance
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
to non-elderly individuals with
 
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:08.309 align:start position:0%
to non-elderly individuals with
disabilities

02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
so um this will actually help
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
because it moves people that may be
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
getting permanent supporting housing
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
into the public housing
 
02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
waivers and vouchers which will free up
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
beds for other
 
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and the same thing for youth
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
who have left foster care who are
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
homeless some housing vouchers to incur
 
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
um challenges we have here
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and i touched on it a little bit is
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordable housing
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire vacancy rates are 1.8
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that's really low um the data
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
i have is that in sullivan county
 
02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's a zero vacancy rate
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
so it's really hard for people um to
 
02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
move out of the shelter system it's a
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
backlog because there's
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of affordable housing for
 
02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
one of the other pieces is i mentioned
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
the rent
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
rent is 14 13 a month
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
for a medium typical two-bedroom
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
apartment and that includes utilities
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
but that's still out of reach for many
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
individuals and families
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
we use state general funds to support
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
the emergency shelter system and
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
we reimburse them at a cost of eight
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
dollars and eighty cents a day when the
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
actual cost is forty seven dollars a day
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and then finally i think um
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
the way we access our the way
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars flow in federal funding is
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
extremely restrictive and siloed
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
so it really limits the ability um for
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
people to be flexible and creative
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
when trying to find solutions for
 
02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:03.429 align:start position:0%
when trying to find solutions for
homelessness

02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
is there a set of waivers we could be
 
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
to to liberate someone yeah so one of
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the things we're working on
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
actually is i'm glad you asked that is
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
the council on housing stability is
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
really looking at
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
what are some solutions and how can we
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
one of the goals is to look at how can
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
we eliminate homelessness and then
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
another piece of it is what do we need
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
as a state and so we're really it's a
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
very broad council we
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
were formed under governor um sununu
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
executive order in
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
um i think november and so we're
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
starting to
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
delve into all of that and really
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
understand the silos and
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
other ways we can apply for waivers
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
restructure how we do things so that's
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
something that we're um looking at and
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have a report that is due
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um in jan in june so hopefully we'll
 
02:48:58.800 --> 02:48:59.190 align:start position:0%
um in jan in june so hopefully we'll
have

02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
some um strong recommendations that come
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
and in your housing program are veterans
 
02:49:06.479 --> 02:49:07.110 align:start position:0%
and in your housing program are veterans
treated

02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
treated
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
like every other uh client or
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
or is there are there special categories
 
02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:14.309 align:start position:0%
or is there are there special categories
for

02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
veteran services there's actually some
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
special funding and special
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
programs for veterans um and there's a
 
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
very large veteran network
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chris this sort of goes back
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:49:36.389 --> 02:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh slide before and maybe you have a
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
slide coming up that has
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
more detail but i was wondering about
 
02:49:44.070 --> 02:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
um homeless homeless youth
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
and young people who find themselves
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
what kinds of programs do we have
 
02:49:51.439 --> 02:49:52.230 align:start position:0%
what kinds of programs do we have
specific

02:49:52.230 --> 02:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
programs for those for those people
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
and yeah how many how many chil
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
young people do we have um who have left
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
that are being served by um your
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
by one of your programs so i do not have
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
that data handy as to the number of
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
youth but i can
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
actually um get that information for the
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee i'm going to go
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
back because we actually
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i can get the information um as to
 
02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
youth are
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
participating in the housing choice
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
vouchers we
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we actually statewide we have one
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
rapid rehousing project for youth that
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
are experiencing homelessness
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe we actually have
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
under our prioritized needs
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
expansion of that program and we're also
 
02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
expansion of that program and we're also
applying

02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
applying
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
for the youth homelessness demonstration
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
project through hud
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
we applied for it two years ago and we
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
were not successful
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
but we are geared up to apply again as
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
soon as hud releases that
 
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
um r of that rfi or rfp
 
02:51:13.240 --> 02:51:13.250 align:start position:0%
but i can get you that data
 
02:51:13.250 --> 02:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
but i can get you that data
[Music]

02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
so could i just ask one more question
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
so i see what i saw on that slide about
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
the foster
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
about the um young people coming out of
 
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
was that they get a voucher how much is
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
the voucher for
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
how does how does that so
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
that is um based on
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
income and so i will get you the exact
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
dollar amount i'm not sure it's section
 
02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
8 housing vouchers
 
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
so i don't have that off the top of my
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
head because we don't administer that
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but i can get that for you okay thank
 
02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
um but i can get that for you okay thank
you

02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%

um representative edwards i think i am
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
going to love these
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um one of so
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of the benchmarks that's looked
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
at is
 
02:52:17.429 --> 02:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
um hud expects a reduction in the
 
02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
average length of p
 
02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
that people experiencing homelessness
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
um we in fiscal year 18 it went from
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
three days
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 19 it was 83 days
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so um what we
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
find is that as the vacancy rate
 
02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:39.190 align:start position:0%
find is that as the vacancy rate
decreases

02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
decreases
 
02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
level of stay increases right so that's
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
what i was talking about earlier is
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
the number of people stay in shelters
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
longer because they can't get out
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
and find affordable housing um and so
 
02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:53.190 align:start position:0%
and find affordable housing um and so
that's

02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's a real issue that we have
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
because we're held responsible
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know for these benchmarks but yet we
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have access to
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
all of um the housing units that the
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
state needs and so that
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
is another area that the council on
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
housing stability is looking at is how
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
do we
 
02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
increase the housing stock because that
 
02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
is what's going to end
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
homelessness with the supportive
 
02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
services for a large majority of people
 
02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
um hud expen expects that
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
income for people who are experiencing
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
homelessness goes
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
up and we show that from fiscal year 18
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
to 19
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
we went up the income went up
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
so um that's a positive thing
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and that um we
 
02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the number of people
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
um from 18 to 19 did decrease
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they expect us to do that for the
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
first time so that's first time
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
and so what's important to know is that
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
um with all of this the fact that
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
housing is hard for people to access
 
02:54:14.230 --> 02:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
this impacts
 
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions you can okay
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right great thank you
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
um this is just an overview of our
 
02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
um this is just an overview of our
budgets

02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
um the majority of our funds um are in
 
02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds and a small amount
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
of well you know our request is higher
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
for general funds
 
02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
but we do get the majority of our funds
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
um so what would we do if we had five
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
percent more um we would increase
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
funding for shelters
 
02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
um you know they have um
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
they have a really hard job and so we
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
really need to um
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
provide them with the resources they
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
need so that they can support um
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who are homeless
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
increase funding would you change that
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
daily rate from 880 a day
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
to something higher yes we would we
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
actually put that in our prioritized
 
02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:24.309 align:start position:0%
actually put that in our prioritized
need

02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
we did not jump up to the 45 dollars a
 
02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
we did not jump up to the 45 dollars a
day

02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
but we did put it in i'm trying to pull
 
02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
it up
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
um what it is
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would increase it to
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
um twenty dollars a person a night
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
so so you're sure that would create
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
more beds or it would just take pressure
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
off of the
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
not for profits that are probably coming
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
up with the rest of the money
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
it would it would do a combination
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
we would look to really
 
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
have them increase their capacity to
 
02:56:07.269 --> 02:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
serve people that are there
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
provide more extensive services but it
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
also would enable them to
 
02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
we would also look to expand and
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
leverage federal funding to increase
 
02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:27.349 align:start position:0%
leverage federal funding to increase
populations

02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
populations
 
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
for unserved populations we'd increase
 
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
some street outreach
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
and youth services as well as enhance
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
our case management
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then the medicaid supportive housing
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
benefit is going to help
 
02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
us to fill gaps i think sometimes
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
landlords may be reluctant to rent to
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who is experiencing
 
02:56:53.429 --> 02:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
a mental health disability or substance
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
use recovering
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
but if they know that they're supportive
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
services around the person they may be
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
more apt
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then if we had a decrease
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think there's some smaller shelter
 
02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
i think there's some smaller shelter
programs

02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that are really getting by
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
barely getting by and some of those
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
would close they are
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
dependent on volunteers
 
02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of them are barely making
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
it by so that
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
could have them close and then
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
eviction funding if we had
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
a decrease and we had to reduce eviction
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
funding that would really impact people
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless we want to try to keep
 
02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:42.550 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless we want to try to keep
people

02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
in their homes when at all possible
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
oh wait there's one okay
 
02:58:05.830 --> 02:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
just one yep
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
two years ago when we were meeting
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
to go through the budget i i found the
 
02:58:11.359 --> 02:58:12.469 align:start position:0%
to go through the budget i i found the
eviction

02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
prevention program to be one of the most
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
um interesting programs i think that we
 
02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
were doing it
 
02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
at the time and because it keep
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
it it keeps us from having people become
 
02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:26.790 align:start position:0%
it it keeps us from having people become
homeless

02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
right and how are we doing on that
 
02:58:30.479 --> 02:58:31.190 align:start position:0%
right and how are we doing on that
program

02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
and how many people are conserving at
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
this point do you know
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
so it gets a little um so we've actually
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know um done a lot this past year
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
especially with coven
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
right and so i can actually i don't have
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
it off the top of my head
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
but i can provide you with the numbers
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
we assisted people with pre-covered
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then the numbers we did during covid
 
02:58:56.640 --> 02:58:57.349 align:start position:0%
and then the numbers we did during covid
because

02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know we had a number of funds
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
especially those from gopher to keep
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
people in their homes
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
um that was coveted related and i think
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think we assisted like 4 700
 
02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:09.910 align:start position:0%
i think we assisted like 4 700
individuals

02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
just with that program and so one of the
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
things we did over this
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
past year is we've really leveraged all
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the additional federal dollars that
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
have come
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
in um to the state and really moved our
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
dollars more towards how can we access
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars first to keep people
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
in their homes because
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
you are absolutely correct um we want to
 
02:59:34.150 --> 02:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
try to keep people in their homes and
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
do what it takes so that people don't
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
experience any homelessness
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
but i can get you those numbers thank
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
you it
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
seems like such a good it seems like
 
02:59:45.670 --> 02:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
such a good use of our
 
02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
fitted resources to try to keep people
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
from ending up
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
homeless right and that includes that's
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
children and families and
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know you know the stressors of
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
moving and it's hard to find
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
housing and so how do we keep people
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
where they um
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
in their secure housing thank you
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well and it also sounds like this
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a a landlord assistance program
 
03:00:14.230 --> 03:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
right i mean because the money that
 
03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:15.190 align:start position:0%
right i mean because the money that
you're

03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
investing is going to the landlord so
 
03:00:19.110 --> 03:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the landlord
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
has less reason to evict someone
 
03:00:26.309 --> 03:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
yeah money goes directly to the
 
03:00:26.319 --> 03:00:27.429 align:start position:0%
yeah money goes directly to the
landlords

03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and so yeah but but we also want to
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
try to make sure
 
03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know not all eviction is related to
 
03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
you know not all eviction is related to
funding

03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and so while that's a critical piece
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
the supportive services are essential to
 
03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
the supportive services are essential to
keep

03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
keep
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
people um to maintain their um
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
housing and to provide the tenancy
 
03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
successful

03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
successful
 
03:00:58.950 --> 03:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
so then um these are just the accounting
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
units we have
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
within um the bureau of housing supports
 
03:01:16.230 --> 03:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i think now we're going to
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
um go over the actual um
 
03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
budget book or the you know accounting
 
03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:25.110 align:start position:0%
budget book or the you know accounting
book

03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
book
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
yes is that did i say it right
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
i try to find it on my spreadsheet okay
 
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
okay aaron it's page 966
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
great thank you so the
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
the first accounting unit um that shows
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
on page 966 is actually one that we're
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
no longer using which is 7925
 
03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
and um chris or rebecca could you just
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
let them know why funds are no longer
 
03:02:07.110 --> 03:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
do we budget somewhere else i'm just
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
pulling it up actually
 
03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
this is oh yes we actually move that i'm
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
um into 79-27
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
because what we wanted to do is actually
 
03:02:24.550 --> 03:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
have it be more of the eviction
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
prevention program this is again one of
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
those programs that was
 
03:02:30.630 --> 03:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
siloed within our own department and so
 
03:02:32.309 --> 03:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
we want to move it under eviction
 
03:02:32.319 --> 03:02:33.910 align:start position:0%
we want to move it under eviction
prevention

03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
03:02:35.670 --> 03:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
so we'll talk about that on the next
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
page so uh
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7926 is the path grant
 
03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:40.469 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7926 is the path grant
this

03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
is 100 federal uh grant
 
03:02:49.190 --> 03:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
well i feel guilty not asking you any
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions just because we're spending
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
well you asked me enough questions so i
 
03:03:02.309 --> 03:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh one thing i will mention here
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
actually we're on this grant that's a
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
federal um something that you're going
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
to see throughout the budget
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
is this change here with funds that are
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
here in class 102 and are now in class
 
03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:18.950 align:start position:0%
here in class 102 and are now in class
74.

03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
74.
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
um as meredith spoke about we have to do
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh sub-recipient monitoring so they're
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
not just considered contractors there
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
are contractors who also provide
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
services on our behalf
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
and so to better track those in the
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
accounting system we have moved those
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
to class 74. so you're going to see that
 
03:03:52.830 --> 03:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right not hearing any questions
 
03:03:58.269 --> 03:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and go down to
 
03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
7927 which is
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
the housing shelter program which also
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
continues on to page 968
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
which is where the the bulk of the
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
you have state money here and it looks
 
03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
you have state money here and it looks
like

03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
it looks like the state money from the
 
03:04:21.279 --> 03:04:21.990 align:start position:0%
it looks like the state money from the
prior

03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
prior
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
budget to your budget is dropping
 
03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:27.910 align:start position:0%
budget to your budget is dropping
significantly

03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
is that is that a correct interpretation
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
03:04:34.230 --> 03:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening here yes rebecca would
 
03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:34.710 align:start position:0%
what's happening here yes rebecca would
you

03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
speak to them so in this current um
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
biennium we were given additional funds
 
03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:41.269 align:start position:0%
biennium we were given additional funds
for

03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
um some of the
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh sorry um
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
programs i believe it was a some for
 
03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:51.110 align:start position:0%
programs i believe it was a some for
eviction

03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
prevention rapid rehousing outreach
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
shelter funds
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
um but because of the pandemic we
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
weren't able to move forward with
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay so codes are a prioritized need for
 
03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
okay so codes are a prioritized need for
us

03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
because we know that the federal dollars
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
will run
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
out and we will need those dollars
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
looks like in the budget though under
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
the shelter program
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're expecting a a nice huge jump in
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm confused by that statement it
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
looks like our federal funds are going
 
03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:31.830 align:start position:0%
looks like our federal funds are going
up

03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:05:33.910 --> 03:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
significantly and our general funds are
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
just give rebecca a minute to pull up
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
that information
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
like for example in fy 93 it's 7.9
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
million for the feds
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
and it's like 3.6 million for
 
03:06:04.389 --> 03:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
i think the federal programs that um
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
that chris was speaking about too was
 
03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
that chris was speaking about too was
the

03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
cares act federal programs which don't
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
happen within this accounting unit they
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we're appropriated cares act funds
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
i assume this is a match requirement of
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
state money to get federal money
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
or is that a bad assumption oh
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh to go back to your question
 
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit had been under
 
03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:41.110 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit had been under
budgeted

03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
with their federal dollars so on
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
each year the grant was just level
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
funded for the budget
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
and now that the programs um
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're working better to work with the
 
03:06:54.960 --> 03:06:56.070 align:start position:0%
we're working better to work with the
vendors

03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
or the shelters and stuff to spend down
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
the dollars
 
03:07:02.950 --> 03:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
um and there was some staff turnover and
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
we've made some
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
really good changes that we are able to
 
03:07:08.950 --> 03:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
utilize the full grant so we
 
03:07:12.070 --> 03:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
um have increased the budget for
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
the next biennium so that sounds like
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
good work
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes is there any way we can go back and
 
03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:20.710 align:start position:0%
yes is there any way we can go back and
ask

03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
retroactively from previous year funds
 
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually what we've done is um the funds
 
03:07:27.520 --> 03:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
actually what we've done is um the funds
are

03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
good for two years i believe
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
and so we're spending the oldest dollars
 
03:07:34.640 --> 03:07:35.590 align:start position:0%
and so we're spending the oldest dollars
first

03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
so we're able to carry those into the
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
where we actually have just gone to
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
increase the federal dollars for the
 
03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
increase the federal dollars for the
current

03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year that we're in
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just want to clarify
 
03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:50.550 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just want to clarify
that

03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars don't go to the
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
shelters those are
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
funded with state general funds um and
 
03:07:56.720 --> 03:07:57.429 align:start position:0%
funded with state general funds um and
so

03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
when we say housing shelter program lots
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
of things are
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
included in this in this budget line
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
but i just want to be clear of that and
 
03:08:07.359 --> 03:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
but i just want to be clear of that and
then

03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that hud has that
 
03:08:11.439 --> 03:08:12.389 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that hud has that
the

03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient agencies they have to
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
you can tell me match uh what the match
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
requirement here is
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner general
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
wallner now has a question
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on 79 26
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah representative walner does yes
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so something that rebecca said
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
um reminded me of a question i really
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's really a question
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
for karen and it's beyond
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
just this page in the budget but they're
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
like you said that there were a number
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
of programs
 
03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um some in this area that really never
 
03:08:59.920 --> 03:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
um some in this area that really never
got

03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
up and running because the pandemic and
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
so we must be lapsing
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
quite a few funds and i wondered if
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
karen if you could provide for us
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
a listing of all those pro of the
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
programs that we are lapsing
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding from uh
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that didn't get up and running
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
and the ones that got up and running
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
um late in the budget and
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
then ended up having addition having
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
funding left
 
03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
in their on their lines sure i think
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
um i can definitely provide that for
 
03:09:40.229 --> 03:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 i'm actually working on a
 
03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
similar request for the fiscal committee
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
um for exactly that i mean you will also
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
see it
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
as we go through here as you see a
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
difference from actuals
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
um presuming that fiscal year 21 budget
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
was similar
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal year 20 budget for fiscal
 
03:09:56.239 --> 03:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal year 20 budget for fiscal
year

03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:10:00.229 --> 03:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
21 um of course we're
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know only not even quite
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of the way through the
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
year so
 
03:10:07.429 --> 03:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
what we have are really estimates and a
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot can happen between now and june a
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
lot could end up contracted between now
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
and june
 
03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
so i am working on a similar request for
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
um but at a much higher level just
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
giving a sense of
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
what is uh staff labs versus
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
programmatic labs and i can also provide
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
that as soon as we
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
have it um
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would just mention i
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
know that
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
some may be thinking okay the pandemic
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
started nine months into the fiscal year
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
but i would just remind everyone that
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
the budget did not pass
 
03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
until october 1st so it was only about
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
three months into the fiscal year
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
um when the pandemic started so people
 
03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
were just starting to
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know be in the planning phases and
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
work towards rfps when um
 
03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
when the contracts unit started writing
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
well and at the same time there was a
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
limited number of providers that could
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
respond to rfps because they were so
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
involved in the pandemic yes
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that the information
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
you're providing to the fiscal committee
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful for this
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee to see that same
 
03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
that same information about which
 
03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
that same information about which
programs

03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
are lapsing funding and i assume that
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have an
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
explanation of why they're lapsing it
 
03:11:35.830 --> 03:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i think that uh i think the
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
explanation across the board is
 
03:11:39.910 --> 03:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
is the pandemic i i don't think that
 
03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
is the pandemic i i don't think that
there's

03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
much of any other reasons other than
 
03:11:44.229 --> 03:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay and i believe those are the only
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
two accounting units for this area
 
03:12:04.150 --> 03:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to go ahead and stop
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
sharing and turn it back over to chris
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a question with uh
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh just going back to
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
mary jane's question
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
so with the lapses
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
you're anticipating and
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
obviously it was last fall into this
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
year how did that impact the governor's
 
03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
year how did that impact the governor's
budget

03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:38.870 align:start position:0%
budget
preparation

03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
do we have any indication
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
how that influenced any of the decisions
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
made for funding for the department or
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
where is that money going
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
i do think that that's probably a
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
question you would need to ask
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office i'm not sure
 
03:13:00.630 --> 03:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
how our lapses impacted their decision
 
03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
how our lapses impacted their decision
making

03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
um i yeah i don't know that i have an
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that triggers a question in my mind
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
when you work with the the governor's
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
office what
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
what human is that is that mostly chris
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
elms or who
 
03:13:19.349 --> 03:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
who do you work with uh no the
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
governor's office has a budget director
 
03:13:24.389 --> 03:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
um who is not i'm going to say his last
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
name wrong son
 
03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:36.389 --> 03:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
so matt i believe matt uh presented to
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
full finance
 
03:13:40.070 --> 03:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
last week so he would be a good person
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
to reach out to from the governor's
 
03:13:41.279 --> 03:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
to reach out to from the governor's
office

03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna unmute you we are going to go
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
to um the bureau of child support can
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
you see my screen
 
03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you um i'm gonna try to
 
03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
do this without
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
having um dave because he's in another
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
meeting so
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
the mission statement for the bureau of
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
child support
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
is that it encourages responsible
 
03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
is that it encourages responsible
parenting

03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
family self-sufficiency and child
 
03:14:21.359 --> 03:14:22.469 align:start position:0%
family self-sufficiency and child
well-being

03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
by providing services to locate parents
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
establish paternity establish modify
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
and enforce support obligations and
 
03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:33.510 align:start position:0%
and enforce support obligations and
obtain

03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
child and medical support for children
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces is this while each
 
03:14:41.279 --> 03:14:41.830 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces is this while each
state

03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
has its own mission statement
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
they all are very similar based on
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
guidelines from the office of child
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
support at a federal level and then
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
we end up putting that into our child
 
03:14:56.319 --> 03:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
we end up putting that into our child
support

03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
um okay the overview
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that child support was created by
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
congress in 1975
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
and it ensures that children and single
 
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
parent households receive a reliable
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
source of private financial
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and medical support we serve families
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
from all
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic backgrounds and actually
 
03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:26.309 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic backgrounds and actually
we

03:15:26.309 --> 03:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:15:29.670 --> 03:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
reach approximately one out of every six
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
children in new hampshire and on average
 
03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:33.670 align:start position:0%
children in new hampshire and on average
disburses

03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
disburses
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
about 83 million dollars a year to
 
03:15:35.920 --> 03:15:37.269 align:start position:0%
about 83 million dollars a year to
families

03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
families
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is a it is one of the largest income
 
03:15:42.309 --> 03:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
support and anti-poverty programs for
 
03:15:42.319 --> 03:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
support and anti-poverty programs for
children

03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
it reduces a family's need for public
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
economic assistance
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's been shown federally to prevent
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
child maltreatment
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
and with this program um we have a 66
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
federal match and then plus
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
which i'll get to later on there's
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
certain outcomes
 
03:16:06.229 --> 03:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
and how we perform those outcomes we
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
actually can receive additional federal
 
03:16:08.239 --> 03:16:11.510 align:start position:0%
actually can receive additional federal
dollars

03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
so i just have to tell you the number
 
03:16:17.269 --> 03:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
one out of six is just really disturbing
 
03:16:18.309 --> 03:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:16:21.510 --> 03:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
um but that's just that's just a comment
 
03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:21.830 align:start position:0%
um but that's just that's just a comment
the

03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
the the line above that where it's you
 
03:16:26.349 --> 03:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
say you serve all
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
socio-economic backgrounds the word
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
all uh is stumped i stumble over that
 
03:16:32.960 --> 03:16:34.070 align:start position:0%
all uh is stumped i stumble over that
because

03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
i would imagine there are income
 
03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
i would imagine there are income
thresholds

03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
and not all economic levels
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
qualify so um
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have people qualify if a family
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
um has a child support order
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
through the courts um they can qualify
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
um if a
 
03:16:59.590 --> 03:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
family says it's much less stressful for
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
me to have the bureau of child support
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
collect the child support
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
than me doing it personally they can
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
qualify for services
 
03:17:11.030 --> 03:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an eligibility program it's an
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
does that help yeah i i
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
i just i was having a hard time
 
03:17:21.279 --> 03:17:22.229 align:start position:0%
i just i was having a hard time
imagining

03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
imagining
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh well-off uh couples or partners
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
needing the help but well it's not
 
03:17:31.110 --> 03:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily the money it's it's
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
actually getting the resources so if you
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
are in
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
a you your relationship ends difficultly
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it can be a control thing for
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
one person to control
 
03:17:45.750 --> 03:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
funds over another person and this
 
03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:47.830 align:start position:0%
funds over another person and this
actually

03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:17:52.150 --> 03:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
takes that out of the equation it also
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
assists with maintaining an accurate
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
accounting of money in
 
03:17:58.950 --> 03:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
um so they can clearly say how much
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
money was given in child support
 
03:18:02.790 --> 03:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and there really there wouldn't be
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
this is just so party huh well i think
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's just uh
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
horrible that uh we got one out of six
 
03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
horrible that uh we got one out of six
kids

03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
tied up in these kinds of situations but
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
again we're getting like but we're also
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're also getting 83 million
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to families so that's um
 
03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
right i'd rather have every kid happy
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
and not needing the program but
 
03:18:34.479 --> 03:18:38.229 align:start position:0%
and not needing the program but
um

03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um here's our case loads
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um we do them every year in september
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see actually we had an
 
03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:47.510 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see actually we had an
increase

03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
um or in 2000
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
um and that was really because we had a
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
new data system
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
but really um we our numbers have
 
03:19:01.830 --> 03:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
declined so i guess um you'll be happy
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
to hear that um representative edwards
 
03:19:04.399 --> 03:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
to hear that um representative edwards
but

03:19:05.190 --> 03:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think two things have
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
caused our caseload numbers to go down
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
the first one was we had
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
really high workloads um prior to
 
03:19:23.030 --> 03:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
2017 and we spent a lot of time on
 
03:19:26.229 --> 03:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
leaning some of our processes um really
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
looking at case
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
management models and really closing
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
cases that people didn't have time to
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
close that we really should have closed
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
so we really went through
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and updated our processes and then
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
secondly um in the
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
we had a new agreement with medicaid in
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid was referring tons of people to
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
child support
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
who didn't want child support services
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
and so we really refined
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
that policy so that um
 
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
only appropriate referrals come in so
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
child support was spending a lot of time
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
with families who didn't want the
 
03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
with families who didn't want the
services

03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so that impacted our caseloads
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
and then we also um
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
were able to close a lot of cases during
 
03:20:19.030 --> 03:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
covid because
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know there was also a decrease in
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
having to go to court cases they were
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
able to do stuff telephonically so that
 
03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:29.349 align:start position:0%
able to do stuff telephonically so that
reduced

03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
some of the drive time but also on the
 
03:20:33.269 --> 03:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid referrals
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
really helped with bringing down our
 
03:20:35.600 --> 03:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
really helped with bringing down our
numbers

03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay any questions okay
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
um there are some key stakeholders i
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
think that's really important to outline
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the bureau of child support
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with the new
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire judicial ban
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
branch who establishes the legal orders
 
03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
they establish paternity often if an
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
order needs to be reviewed and modified
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
um that's done you know with the
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
judicial brand we work
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
very closely on with employers to verify
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
income and health care coverage um to
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
garnish wages and then to assist to
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
enroll children in health care
 
03:21:21.070 --> 03:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then we work very closely with other
 
03:21:21.080 --> 03:21:22.229 align:start position:0%
and then we work very closely with other
non-governmental

03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
non-governmental
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
agencies we work interstate and
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
international to
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
collect child support dollars for
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
families and we work with our
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay we provide our services
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
across the 11 district offices and then
 
03:21:48.750 --> 03:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
we have a centralized
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental and legal unit as well
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
as customer
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
service we use technology
 
03:21:58.710 --> 03:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and case management and we
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
are required
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
to disperse payments within 48 business
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
hours of receipt of those payments
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
we have to work closely with our
 
03:22:09.680 --> 03:22:11.030 align:start position:0%
we have to work closely with our
stakeholders

03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
employers and then we use
 
03:22:17.830 --> 03:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know methods of establishing legal
 
03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:18.630 align:start position:0%
you know methods of establishing legal
fatherhood

03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
fatherhood
 
03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
including genetic testing we also
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
will provide across state
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
collection if one parent resides in
 
03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
some of our accomplishments is
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
um we're cost effective we collected
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
nearly 89 million dollars
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
in federal fiscal year 2020
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
and for every dollar that is spent on
 
03:22:46.800 --> 03:22:48.349 align:start position:0%
and for every dollar that is spent on
services

03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have positive outcomes achieved by
 
03:22:55.840 --> 03:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
we have positive outcomes achieved by
children

03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
um because we are able to address
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
individual needs
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
services reduce public assistance and
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
prevent child maltreatment
 
03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
we also developed and implemented a
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
five-year strategic plan
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic we really
 
03:23:16.319 --> 03:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic we really
increase

03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
performance due to um the court's
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
electronic methods
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
we were really able um to
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
um continue services uninterrupted
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
um and we as the courts were continuing
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
to process child support using telephone
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
and video methods
 
03:23:38.910 --> 03:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
it actually resulted in an increase in
 
03:23:38.920 --> 03:23:40.469 align:start position:0%
it actually resulted in an increase in
participation

03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
participation
 
03:23:44.229 --> 03:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
um between parents um you would actually
 
03:23:47.190 --> 03:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
not think that would be the case but
 
03:23:48.070 --> 03:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
parents who
 
03:23:51.030 --> 03:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
had to pay child support didn't have to
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
take an
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
entire day off from work to sit in the
 
03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
entire day off from work to sit in the
courthouse

03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
they were able to have a telephone
 
03:23:56.840 --> 03:23:58.150 align:start position:0%
they were able to have a telephone
appointment

03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that process really worked on
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of orders that
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
were established
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
some of our challenges
 
03:24:17.190 --> 03:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
is current economic conditions because
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
high unemployment may impact certain
 
03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
high unemployment may impact certain
businesses

03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
so people will actually maybe make less
 
03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:25.110 align:start position:0%
so people will actually maybe make less
money

03:24:25.110 --> 03:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:24:27.990 --> 03:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that'll impact child support that is
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
given to children
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
a challenge is always figuring out how
 
03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
do we
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
improve the customer experience
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
how do we use more technology so that
 
03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
how do we use more technology so that
we're

03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
able to get at people um that don't want
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
to make an appointment that want to do
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
things online
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
and really how do we how are we always
 
03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
looking at how do we improve our
 
03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:52.630 align:start position:0%
looking at how do we improve our
performance

03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
with process improvements autumn
 
03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:56.389 align:start position:0%
with process improvements autumn
automation

03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
automation
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
that really is going to help us increase
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
we do actually have um certain um
 
03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
performance levels and this is
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
child support nationally has an
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
incentive system
 
03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
that measures your performance in these
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
five areas
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
establishment of paternity support
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
orders established
 
03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
collection of what's owed
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
cases paying in the arrears and cost
 
03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:31.429 align:start position:0%
cases paying in the arrears and cost
effectiveness

03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
03:25:34.469 --> 03:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
and so because of this
 
03:25:38.070 --> 03:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
we actually exceed um national
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
benchmarks um and so each year we
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
receive financial incentives
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
um for this and um this has been
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
um and then we're able to reinvest those
 
03:25:50.319 --> 03:25:51.030 align:start position:0%
um and then we're able to reinvest those
dollars

03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
um into our child support program so
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
this past year we were able to use some
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
of our incentive dollars
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
based on um meeting exceeding
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
expectations in these areas to assist
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
with some of the equipment staff needed
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
to work remotely and so
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great way because we the
 
03:26:16.150 --> 03:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
states actually get rewarded for doing
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
good work that's great we
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
we have representative earth with a
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
question oh i'm sorry
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
hi going back a few slides to number
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
eight which shows your district offices
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering is this another
 
03:26:32.469 --> 03:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
unique set of district offices or
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
are these overlapping with some other
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
operations as well no so we use
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
our regular district offices that we
 
03:26:40.630 --> 03:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
have across the state so we
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
our staff are housed in our district
 
03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
our staff are housed in our district
offices

03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
offices
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
when you say we oh i'm sorry yes
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
dhhs yes so in our district offices we
 
03:26:51.040 --> 03:26:51.830 align:start position:0%
dhhs yes so in our district offices we
have

03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
child support adult protective services
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf the bureau of family assistance and
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
the bureau of employment support so
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
we're all
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
housed in those offices okay now do the
 
03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:05.110 align:start position:0%
housed in those offices okay now do the
idn's

03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
idn's
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
come under dhhs in terms of the are you
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
sort of responsible for them
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not responsible for the idn's no
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:27:15.670 --> 03:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
under um medicaid and behavioral health
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
and they have seven regions right it's
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's how many regions does the state
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
have to have right
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
um okay but my question is so when you
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
answer the question about what you have
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
you just meant specifically
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
beneath you i'm talking about dhh
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
hhs as a whole how many different
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
combinations of just of of
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
mappings do they have if you will to the
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
state so i'm going to look to see if
 
03:27:45.990 --> 03:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
karen is still on the the areas that i
 
03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
karen is still on the the areas that i
use

03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
primarily follow district office
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
catchment areas but there are a number
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the public health which they'll talk
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
about has
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
public health networks um the area
 
03:28:02.710 --> 03:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
agencies and community mental health
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
centers are broken up into 10 areas
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i think the physical locations of our
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
offices in the state
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
are the the district offices and those
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
include staff
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
from this division from dcyf from
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
division of long-term supports and
 
03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
division of long-term supports and
services

03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
the contractors that we have or the
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
sub-recipients that we have
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
they may have different catchment areas
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
or different
 
03:28:32.229 --> 03:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
models that cover different areas like
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
the public health networks or
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
the dd system like chris mentioned but
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
they do not
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
utilize our district offices with their
 
03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
utilize our district offices with their
staff

03:28:41.750 --> 03:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
they have their own offices with their
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
own staff
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay so there's no way to make them not
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily identical to you or whatever
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
it is 11.
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
but to follow the same lines so
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
that is a larger question i i wish you
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
had asked that when the commissioner was
 
03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:02.550 align:start position:0%
had asked that when the commissioner was
here

03:29:02.550 --> 03:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:29:05.190 --> 03:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
something that she um has some strong
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
feelings about as well and something
 
03:29:07.120 --> 03:29:07.830 align:start position:0%
feelings about as well and something
that

03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
she would like to um
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
to have the department look at in a
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
strategic planning
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
um okay in a strategic way
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
um but that's not something that's
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know uniform right now well i know
 
03:29:24.239 --> 03:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
you know uniform right now well i know
that

03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so this here actually
 
03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
shows you um our different performance
 
03:29:39.030 --> 03:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
measures um in the different areas
 
03:29:40.630 --> 03:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
that we talked about on the previous
 
03:29:43.349 --> 03:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
slide and i wish that we actually had a
 
03:29:45.269 --> 03:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
side by side on this one
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so you could see that you know this
 
03:29:48.720 --> 03:29:49.030 align:start position:0%
um so you could see that you know this
is

03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
our increases in the
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
paternity establishment that actually
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
while our numbers went down a little bit
 
03:29:59.760 --> 03:30:01.670 align:start position:0%
while our numbers went down a little bit
in

03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
this past fiscal year due to the
 
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic we still were higher
 
03:30:08.710 --> 03:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
than national standards and so for a
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
period when
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
some of the offices and you know out
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
laboratories and stuff
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
were closed down our numbers went down a
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
little bit but then
 
03:30:20.469 --> 03:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
but we we still exceeded performance
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
nationally which is
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
extremely beneficial because
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
some of the other new england states
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
weren't as successful as we were and
 
03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:30.070 align:start position:0%
weren't as successful as we were and
they

03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
actually are going to be losing some
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
dollars based on that
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
we actually continue to um
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase support orders and
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
child support paid paid so
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
we did actually um
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
receive more money in fiscal year 20
 
03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:52.550 align:start position:0%
receive more money in fiscal year 20
because

03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
of some of the economic impact payments
 
03:30:56.950 --> 03:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
we were able to assist that
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
with um payment of the on the arrears
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
any questions okay
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the calls i get that have the most
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
emotion and passion in them are the
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
calls that are related to people caught
 
03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
calls that are related to people caught
up

03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the child support system and and
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to war with their their
 
03:31:29.680 --> 03:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
they're going to war with their their
partner

03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
partner
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
over things related to the the kids what
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
decisions of the court decisions of dhhs
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know complaints that a paternity
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
test was established on one kid but not
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
the other three
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know uh stuff like that so i'm just
 
03:31:48.319 --> 03:31:49.429 align:start position:0%
you know uh stuff like that so i'm just
curious

03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
curious
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
if there's a metric or any tracking
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
being done on
 
03:31:58.150 --> 03:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
um customers i hate to say it that way
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
but customer satisfaction
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
or or or the extent to which
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh because i i saw that was one of your
 
03:32:07.990 --> 03:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
challenges something you want to work on
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
but but are there any measures in place
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to sort of track um satisfaction with
 
03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:15.429 align:start position:0%
to sort of track um satisfaction with
the

03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the system yep um and so
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm um that's something we always want
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
to look for and you know and one of the
 
03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:24.630 align:start position:0%
to look for and you know and one of the
pieces

03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
is you know we don't put um
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
um the orders in place right we are
 
03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing some orders that are
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
are done through the court system and
 
03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there's lots of emotions and
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's lots of
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
complicating factors our current it
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
system does not allow us to track
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
customer satisfaction
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
but that is one of the things we're
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
looking to improve with some of our
 
03:32:51.990 --> 03:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
incentive dollars
 
03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
um karen who is the bureau chief and i
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
have talked and
 
03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's one of the things we
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to look at with our
 
03:33:02.550 --> 03:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
incentive dollars also you know the
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines that's done
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
through um rule and statute and so
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
um it is something that um
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
how are your employees doing in this
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
area is this an
 
03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
area where you have a lot of attrition a
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
lot of stress a lot of burnout
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
or are they pretty well shielded from
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh the public sentiment so
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
again you know um it is a stressful
 
03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
job um i have to say but they are
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
very dedicated and very committed to the
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
goals and the outcomes of the child
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
support program we
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
um provide a lot of um support
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
um to them and there's very little
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
attrition within this part of the
 
03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:52.150 align:start position:0%
attrition within this part of the
division

03:33:52.150 --> 03:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay um this is just a little bit here
 
03:34:02.720 --> 03:34:03.190 align:start position:0%
okay um this is just a little bit here
about

03:34:03.190 --> 03:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:34:06.269 --> 03:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
our funds like we said it's um
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
33 um
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal i mean general funds the rest
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
are 34
 
03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um fed general the rest is
 
03:34:19.590 --> 03:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
um federal dollars um and
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have a small amount of other funds
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
so this trend there has shown that
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the percentage of
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
state dollars uh over each budget
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
but and our federal money isn't growing
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit um some of the federal
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
defer to rebecca on some of this is that
 
03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:00.229 align:start position:0%
defer to rebecca on some of this is that
we

03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually are budgeting less incentive
 
03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
funds so that we can use those
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
that was one of the pieces with our
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
incentive funds and i'll let rebecca
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little bit and then
 
03:35:19.349 --> 03:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
some of the spending we
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
had with our incentive funds because of
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
covid delayed some of that work and so
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
is being moved forward into our next
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
did you still have a question
 
03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:41.269 align:start position:0%
did you still have a question
representative

03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just looking at the three uh
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
bubble charts here in the red
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
and each each uh budget we're increasing
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
about 1.2 million
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
or more each year and so
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a pretty rapid
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase in state funding
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm so i'm just
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what what's what's
 
03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:04.950 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious what what's what's
driving

03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
driving
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
so there was i think it was
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
it was this biennium on our
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
nexus system wasn't supported through
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
so the prior biennium we
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
used incentive funds to keep enhancing
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
the system
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
and this biennium were in we
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
switched those dollars so that it was
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
general funds and the federal funds
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
instead of using the incentive dollars
 
03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
so that we could use the incentive
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to try and
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
enhance areas that we weren't able to do
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
previously so
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds like you're describing
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
these incentive monies going somewhere
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
where the legislature doesn't have
 
03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
visibility over it
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
so but i'm sure that's not true that's
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
not true
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's really trying to yeah it's
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do things like we talked about
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
with customer satisfaction
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
and really not have it be for general
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
um operations and and maintenance of the
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
system and so by
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
including some of the nexus into our
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
um main you know our maintenance and
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
operations we're able to actually get
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
66 federal match on that um
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
which is very helpful
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
the um incentive buttons are not
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
supplant funds it's supposed to
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:49.190 --> 03:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions uh yes
 
03:37:49.200 --> 03:37:51.030 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions uh yes
representative

03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:56.229 --> 03:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
um i have two questions one on the
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
previous slide can i just assume that
 
03:37:58.000 --> 03:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
previous slide can i just assume that
bigger

03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
percentages are better back on the key
 
03:38:01.990 --> 03:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
performance indicators i'm just not sure
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
what ivd pep means
 
03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
oh sure yep yep it's um it goes to
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
establish yes
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is the paternity
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
establishment and then the next one is
 
03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:14.070 align:start position:0%
establishment and then the next one is
establishment

03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
of um of the
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
court orders percent of child of
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
received paid and then the percent were
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
paying on
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the arrears so it's our um yeah
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
i can send you the actual acronyms i
 
03:38:30.239 --> 03:38:31.269 align:start position:0%
i can send you the actual acronyms i
apologize

03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
no that's okay i think i have the list i
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
just didn't recognize it okay
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
but the real question is on your current
 
03:38:37.359 --> 03:38:38.469 align:start position:0%
but the real question is on your current
slide

03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
slide
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
yep this one that one i'm looking at
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet not the book so maybe
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't add up but
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
you show for instance 22 23 9.9 million
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
for general funds
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the general funds and i assume
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's the budget correct your budget
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
amounts rebecca yes
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
4.0 roughly a million in
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
22 and 4.3 million roughly in 23
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is way less than 9.9 i'm just
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
this is um the agency phase
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
request we um
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
the budget was reduced there's a couple
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
of unfunded positions
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
after the governor's space okay so
 
03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
here's another question for you then
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
same question but for the previous for
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
the current biennium
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
20 20 2020 and 2021 you show up 8.4
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
million and yet in both
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
years in the governor's budget for
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
showing the actual 20 and the adjusted
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
authorized 20 they're less than 4
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
million each
 
03:39:52.870 --> 03:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
so a total of under 8 million in other
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
words i'm just wondering again
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
so we took um so for that
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh chart it's the actual 420
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
and then 21 is adjusted authorized
 
03:40:08.790 --> 03:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's what i gave you but the
 
03:40:08.800 --> 03:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
that's what i gave you but the
adjustment

03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
price is just under 4 million 9.3.978
 
03:40:16.830 --> 03:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
and the actual 120 is uh 3.841
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
million um may ask are you looking at
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
one accounting unit or are you looking
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
at the whole
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
um program i'm looking at 79.29
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
is that okay there's more um
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
programs with that there's i believe
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
four accounting units
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
that pick up the total well okay that
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
aren't that weren't included in this
 
03:40:39.359 --> 03:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
aren't that weren't included in this
presentation

03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
right no all four of the accounting
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
units are on
 
03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:48.469 align:start position:0%
units are on
oh

03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes so this this represents all four of
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
those okay
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
thanks i i don't know if this
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
matches up against the um what's in the
 
03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for the budget because i'm
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
looking at child support services in the
 
03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:05.269 align:start position:0%
looking at child support services in the
spreadsheet

03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and in fy 22 and 23
 
03:41:14.309 --> 03:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
the general fund is 4.084 million
 
03:41:18.070 --> 03:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then the next year is 4.275
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
so that's about an 8.3
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
total but i'm seeing 9.9
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
in the red there in the bubble chart
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
so um are are these
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
did numbers match i guess is the
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
question i think that's the same thing
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
that representative earth was speaking
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
you may just be looking at one
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit all four accounting
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
units totaled
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
um even in the governor's phase are nine
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
point two or three okay
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
so so the issue is with the headline of
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
this slide where it says bureau of child
 
03:41:56.160 --> 03:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
this slide where it says bureau of child
support

03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
services budget it's more than just
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
this activity name child support
 
03:42:02.399 --> 03:42:04.469 align:start position:0%
this activity name child support
services

03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:42:06.150 --> 03:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
i just figured it out it's actually the
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the column before
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
which says child support services
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
basically has four components of which
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
we were looking at one of those four
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
which also has the same name child
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
support services
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
correct those kids they need a lot of
 
03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
correct those kids they need a lot of
support

03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
right all right very good
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
um again the um
 
03:42:34.389 --> 03:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
five percent increase decrease would be
 
03:42:34.399 --> 03:42:35.269 align:start position:0%
five percent increase decrease would be
um

03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know we would obtain better outcomes
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
for children
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
meaning getting more resources for
 
03:42:42.399 --> 03:42:43.830 align:start position:0%
meaning getting more resources for
children

03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
reach parents who are not yet using
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
child support services there may be some
 
03:42:50.150 --> 03:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
parents who
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
are in need of the services that aren't
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
aware of it um and really look to
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
enhance our tools for better customer
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
service so that people can do
 
03:43:02.710 --> 03:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
more stuff online off hours um
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
and do more self-service
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
decrease would be a delay in
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
families receipt of needed support we
 
03:43:11.920 --> 03:43:12.469 align:start position:0%
families receipt of needed support we
also

03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
would risk not being in compliant with
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
our federal time frames and other
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
requirements which have financial
 
03:43:19.040 --> 03:43:20.710 align:start position:0%
requirements which have financial
penalties

03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
and then also fiscal penalties for poor
 
03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:25.269 align:start position:0%
and then also fiscal penalties for poor
performance

03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass our data reliability
 
03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:28.710 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass our data reliability
audit

03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
audit
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
i mean also earlier i talked about the
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
incentive funds that is really
 
03:43:33.279 --> 03:43:34.550 align:start position:0%
incentive funds that is really
additional

03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that um we use
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
to do some of those um enhancements to
 
03:43:41.680 --> 03:43:42.150 align:start position:0%
to do some of those um enhancements to
our

03:43:42.150 --> 03:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
service delivery system and that would
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
be impacted
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay so you know from my previous
 
03:43:48.399 --> 03:43:49.189 align:start position:0%
okay so you know from my previous
comments

03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:43:51.510 --> 03:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this this line that says obtain
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for children
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
if you could somehow make that
 
03:43:57.990 --> 03:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
measurable yep
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
i will do that okay and we will get that
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
you send them sounds like you added a
 
03:44:04.720 --> 03:44:05.910 align:start position:0%
you send them sounds like you added a
fourth

03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
decremented budget outcome by by saying
 
03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:09.269 align:start position:0%
decremented budget outcome by by saying
we

03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:44:12.150 --> 03:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
we might miss out on federal incentive
 
03:44:12.160 --> 03:44:12.790 align:start position:0%
we might miss out on federal incentive
money

03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes is that really your third box that
 
03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:16.870 align:start position:0%
yes is that really your third box that
really

03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know um falls into the third box um
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
but um and we will provide all of that
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
um in writing because i think um
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know um it'll be easier that way
 
03:44:29.760 --> 03:44:31.910 align:start position:0%
you know um it'll be easier that way
definitely

03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome um and then these are the
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
accounting units um that make
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
up those circles on two slides ahead
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
so um that will
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
we'll walk through that when we go to um
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
walk through the budget book and then
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
um here's just a break out of the staff
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
we have 127
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
positions um and this is how they're
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
broken out
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay how's your voice holding out you've
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
been talking a lot
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's what i do i'm italian so i talk
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
really well
 
03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i have to say and i can go on and you
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
can't even see my arms moving all the
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
time so um you're really lucky at that
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
point so
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to now turn it over to rebecca
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
and karen and i'm going to have
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
as you saw in the presentation from
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
chris uh there are four
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
accounting units in this section
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
starting with 7929 as rebecca just
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
i think i have a question here i'm i'm
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
um expedited ivd services
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it looks like uh
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
we're getting federal funds of just
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
under 900 000.
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
and then um i think that's a later
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's not that's 79.34
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
i jumped ahead to ivd i'm sorry i i just
 
03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
so um so so we don't spend any
 
03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
state money on paternity tests
 
03:46:52.150 --> 03:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's all federal is that
 
03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
is that am i reading this spreadsheet
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
correctly that
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
ivd services their funding is all
 
03:46:58.640 --> 03:47:03.110 align:start position:0%
ivd services their funding is all
federal

03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
um um are you looking at the accounting
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
in it 7934
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes that's actually um
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's for uh the courts
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's um we have a contract with the
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts for
 
03:47:22.469 --> 03:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
the marital masters
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
they hear cases and they get reimbursed
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
for um the federal portion so
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
i could have sworn earlier on the
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
performance slide
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the bar graphs that ibd
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
was for paternity testing but
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
but that's okay and it just
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
i i i'm just a little confused because i
 
03:47:51.439 --> 03:47:52.229 align:start position:0%
i i i'm just a little confused because i
thought

03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
ivd on the bar chart was
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's what it's referred to because
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's the title of the social security
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
act so
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of pieces um are it governs the
 
03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
a couple of pieces um are it governs the
program

03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
all right so so maybe
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
somebody in the committee could train me
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
later because i'm i'm confused it looks
 
03:48:25.359 --> 03:48:25.830 align:start position:0%
later because i'm i'm confused it looks
like

03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is all money to pay for the pay the
 
03:48:28.399 --> 03:48:29.110 align:start position:0%
this is all money to pay for the pay the
court

03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the court activities
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
but in the performance chart it was
 
03:48:35.279 --> 03:48:36.229 align:start position:0%
but in the performance chart it was
described

03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
described
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
as paternity testing or paternity
 
03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:43.189 align:start position:0%
as paternity testing or paternity
establishment

03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot of money and it's federal
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
so let's move on
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
i just uh it just it just seemed like
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're using different descriptions of
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the same letters
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
ask a question yes
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
what are indirect costs line 40
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that uh mr ripple provided
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
the information from department of
 
03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services on class 40.
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
um so i haven't sent that along yet
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
an email to you all later today it
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
may be posted to our website though i'm
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
not sure yet
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
and perhaps related to justin's question
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible that there's some of that
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
paternity stuff
 
03:49:38.710 --> 03:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the main 7929
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
rebecca do you know exactly what class
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
line we pay them to assign
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
we do pay it out of the contracts line
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
um and some of it it's paid yeah it's
 
03:49:52.630 --> 03:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
paid out of 102.
 
03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
does that make sense jess yes
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't spend any state money to
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
establish paternity
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
is is that a true statement
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
um we do pay the 34
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
general oh general funds and then it's
 
03:50:10.239 --> 03:50:11.429 align:start position:0%
general oh general funds and then it's
66

03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
66
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit 7929 does have
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
general funds in it
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions on 79.29
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh 7931 which is the
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
state disbursement unit
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
who do we contract with us um
 
03:51:01.269 --> 03:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
they um they disburse
 
03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
the funds they receive them and disperse
 
03:51:13.279 --> 03:51:14.950 align:start position:0%
the funds they receive them and disperse
them

03:51:14.950 --> 03:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
we're required to have that that a place
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
where funds are received
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
disbursed um and distribute the payments
 
03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
and it interfaces with our child support
 
03:51:25.279 --> 03:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
and it interfaces with our child support
system

03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
so is that a cost or just for money
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
flowing through
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's a cost for to pay the contractor to
 
03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
transfer those funds
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
which ones are they paying all across
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
the entire department or
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
no this is just the child support fund
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
so chris how many how many
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
millions a year are paid in child
 
03:51:48.150 --> 03:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
support like 83 million dollars a year
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
so this is this is the it system to
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
to manage making those 80 million
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in payments
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
within two days of receiving them well
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good time out with this with
 
03:52:00.070 --> 03:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
the high
 
03:52:00.080 --> 03:52:03.110 align:start position:0%
the high
turnaround

03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
all right moving down to 79.33
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
access and visitation it's a hundred
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar federal grant
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
and lastly in child support is 7934
 
03:52:38.830 --> 03:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.840 --> 03:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
any questions i don't i don't see any
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes just so you know when you turn
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the side there
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
and kind of move your head a little bit
 
03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
away we lose you
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
automatically i should lean in like this
 
03:52:56.160 --> 03:52:57.189 align:start position:0%
automatically i should lean in like this
then

03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
you don't need to lean that far in it's
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
just when you sit back and turn your
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
head that we kind of lose you
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
um chair if i might um is it possible
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
i could request a five minute break this
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
last presentation is about 25 slides and
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh 15 accounting units so i expect it'll
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
take more than an hour so i'm just
 
03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:20.830 align:start position:0%
take more than an hour so i'm just
thinking

03:53:20.830 --> 03:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:53:20.840 --> 03:53:26.710 align:start position:0%
thinking
um

03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll come back it's 126. uh let's
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
come back at uh 135
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.840 --> 04:00:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.840 --> 04:01:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:01:02.830 --> 04:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.840 --> 04:01:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
hey representative erf you got your hand
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
up did did you have a question to start
 
04:01:20.640 --> 04:01:21.750 align:start position:0%
up did did you have a question to start
the

04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh when we get back from recess or is
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
that now
 
04:01:26.469 --> 04:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
no i just put that up i just want to ask
 
04:01:28.150 --> 04:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
karen a quick question before we start
 
04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
the next one if you don't mind
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
all right sure
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
um the the ones in a lot of the fields
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the 20 79 29 we just looked at what
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
are those
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah they're just placeholders so that
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
the class lines don't have to be created
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
if they're budgeted at zero then the
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
class lines have to be
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
created to transfer funds into them
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
um so is that another way of saying that
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
if they're zeros they go away yes
 
04:02:19.269 --> 04:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then we have to get them recreated
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
which creates some problems
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
rebecca correct me if i'm wrong but i
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
think where we did do that
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
we budgeted one dollar as a federal
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
dollar as a placeholder not a general
 
04:02:28.319 --> 04:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
dollar as a placeholder not a general
fund

04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
correct okay yes so if we if you
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated those that would eliminate
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
only federal funds there's no general
 
04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
funds in those
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
class lines that we budgeted a dollar
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
i mean there's never general funds or
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
just right now there's not
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
right now right now there's not when we
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
use the one dollar as a placeholder
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
we budgeted as a federal dollar as a
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
placeholder not as a general fund
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
right but if you go to use it you could
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
put general funds into it
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
correct but they would have to come from
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so they would get
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
transferred from a different line
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
right right yes
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
you had a question i guess i guess we're
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
out of recess and
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're running again go ahead no
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
i just i just um picked up my husband
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
just picked up my mail
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
and in the mail today was the budget
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
04:03:20.469 --> 04:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
that i brought karen put together and i
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
just want to say thank you
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
and it looks really very thorough and
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
has lots of good information in it
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome it might be a lot of work
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
i passed that thank you
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
on to uh the directors and the finance
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
directors who worked on that
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it was very much appreciated we um
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
we did not we were not able to provide
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
fun for the governor's phase
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so i'm thrilled that we were able to
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
get one for for this
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
phase so it is really helpful thank you
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay so miss santinello
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
how are your arms are you ready to start
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
waving your hands against
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
i am and here i go so we are going to do
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
the um bureau of family assistance and
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
the bureau
 
04:04:09.150 --> 04:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
of employment supports together
 
04:04:09.160 --> 04:04:10.630 align:start position:0%
of employment supports together
programmatically

04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
programmatically
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
they are separate but they are very
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
closely aligned
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and so because of how the money flows
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
and all of that it makes a lot of sense
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
to do them
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.279 --> 04:04:32.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.590 --> 04:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay great so um the mission
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
statement for the bureau of family
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
assistance which was made by the team
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
in statute or rule is to provide value
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
services and supports to assess
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
children individuals and families
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
towards upward
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
social and economic well-being
 
04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
to overall decrease the need for
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
assistance by
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
providing services and supports in the
 
04:04:58.319 --> 04:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
providing services and supports in the
areas

04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
of employment family well-being and
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
barrier removal
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
and with the bureau of employment
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
supports um it's really to assist
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
parents with upward economic mobility
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
by promoting work um through the
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
provision of employment support and
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
training services
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
in an effort to strengthen families and
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
improve child and family well-being
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
again this was done by the team not by
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
statute or
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
rule so when we get into the
 
04:05:32.229 --> 04:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
right spot around that would would you
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
make sure i understand
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
the distinction between your role and
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
the role over
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
in uh dehs or whatever the employment
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
services group is
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
because they they have a training
 
04:05:44.479 --> 04:05:46.469 align:start position:0%
because they they have a training
responsibility

04:05:46.469 --> 04:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
statewide we have 12 or more
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
training programs and so i can get into
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit but
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
um rich lavers and i actually we we work
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
very closely and our
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
end is while it is on some of the
 
04:06:01.359 --> 04:06:02.229 align:start position:0%
end is while it is on some of the
employment

04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
pieces of it a lot of it is barrier
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
reduction and so
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
providing some of the supports so then
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
participate in some of rich's programs
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
um at employment
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
um security and he and i have talked a
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
lot about
 
04:06:19.750 --> 04:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know and unfortunately covet kind of
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
really you know
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
got in the way of doing some planning is
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
how can we
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
bring our services better together and
 
04:06:26.720 --> 04:06:27.510 align:start position:0%
bring our services better together and
streamline

04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
streamline
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
and build off of the strengths of each
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
and not have duplicative services so
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
that is definitely on my radar the term
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
barrier support or removing barriers
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think has shifted over the last i
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
can't hear you i'm sorry
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i i said i think the
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
term barrier reduction or removal
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
is probably varied over the last 20
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
years what what
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
do you think it currently means well so
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
it depends right so
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
for some individuals it could be
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
reliable transportation
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to talk about that a
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
little bit later um others
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
is access to child care sometimes it's
 
04:07:10.399 --> 04:07:10.950 align:start position:0%
is access to child care sometimes it's
just

04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
the money to pay for credentialing or
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
in other instances it's access to
 
04:07:21.429 --> 04:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
mental health services or substance use
 
04:07:21.439 --> 04:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
mental health services or substance use
services

04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
or domestic violence support so um some
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
of those things and how do we connect
 
04:07:28.150 --> 04:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
people to those so that they're
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
successful at work
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
yep so the bureau of family assistance
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
primarily is the focus is to gain access
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
to supplemental
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs which we call snap
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
medical coverage
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
some of our state supplemental programs
 
04:07:49.110 --> 04:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
which we'll talk about
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the tanf program and child care
 
04:07:52.080 --> 04:07:53.670 align:start position:0%
on the tanf program and child care
scholarship

04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
with really the focus to ensure that
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
adults children and families have access
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
to health care
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
nutritious food child care and financial
 
04:08:02.880 --> 04:08:04.469 align:start position:0%
nutritious food child care and financial
resources

04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:08:07.110 --> 04:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
bfa also sets policy and program
 
04:08:07.120 --> 04:08:08.309 align:start position:0%
bfa also sets policy and program
implementation

04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
for the snap program and for the tanf
 
04:08:10.720 --> 04:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
for the snap program and for the tanf
program

04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
the bureau of employment supports which
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
we just referenced
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
is really it's the work on program for
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who have tanf
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
and snap utilizing a whole family's
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
approach to jobs framework
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
it nhep works to provide parents with
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the employability
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
skills that will result in establishing
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
careers and
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately will help move children and
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
families out of poverty
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
some of the work they do is to ensure
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
participants gain employment
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of community
 
04:08:46.159 --> 04:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of community
resources

04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
obtain certain life skills to
 
04:08:53.110 --> 04:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
balance work and family and then really
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
focus on an identified career pathway
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
we'll work with laborers and educational
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
training organizations to address labor
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
market needs through training
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
we focus on training opportunities to
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
assist parents in gaining employment
 
04:09:07.840 --> 04:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
assist parents in gaining employment
credentials

04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
so for example recently within our
 
04:09:12.399 --> 04:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
so for example recently within our
division

04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bureau of child development
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
met with the bureau of employment
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
supports and said okay
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
how do we provide resources
 
04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
so that individuals who are on tanf or
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
snap will go
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
into the child care field how can we
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
take some of the resources that we have
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
for education
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
and help generate more workers in the
 
04:09:39.510 --> 04:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
child care industry
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
in a couple of weeks we're actually
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
meeting with a non-profit organization
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's really looking at their workforce
 
04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
and workflow
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of employment supports
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
along with
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
um the department of employment services
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
were both meeting with the agency to say
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
all right how do we frame our services
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can provide you with some
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
resource resources for
 
04:10:05.920 --> 04:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
resource resources for
employees

04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
here we will um
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
these are the case loads we have
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
for the different programs under
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
the bureau of family assistance and
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
we have here for the different fiscal
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
years the first one is
 
04:10:29.910 --> 04:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
tanf which is the cash assistance and so
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
on one side you see the case load
 
04:10:31.760 --> 04:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
on one side you see the case load
numbers

04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
and on the other side you're going to
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
see the average
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
monthly grant the families
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
with dependent children um
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's the right i always mess
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
up that acronym
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that is tied um to tanf it's a
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
relatively small number
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
we have the interim disabled parent
 
04:10:53.199 --> 04:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
we have the interim disabled parent
program

04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
which again is tied to our tanf the old
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
age assistance
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
aid to the and and i should back up the
 
04:11:01.520 --> 04:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
aid to the and and i should back up the
flock

04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
flock
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
and idp that goes towards our tanf
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
moe and then we have old age assistance
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
aid to the needy blind and aid to the
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
permanently and totally disabled
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
which goes to our medicaid maintenance
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
of effort and these are the
 
04:11:21.990 --> 04:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
um numbers of individuals
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
in these categories and the monthly
 
04:11:24.960 --> 04:11:26.070 align:start position:0%
in these categories and the monthly
average

04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
average
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
grant that individuals receive while on
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
any questions okay
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
um and then here is the actual um
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
monthly grant for for fiscal years 18
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
19 20 and what we've have budgeted
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
yep that's fine i'm gonna grab my other
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.840 --> 04:12:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you i'm sorry oh you can go
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um and here's where we are
 
04:12:27.920 --> 04:12:28.469 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um and here's where we are
with

04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
what we budgeted in fiscal year 20 and
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
our actual expenditures
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20. you'll see that aptd
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
we actually spent more than we budgeted
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
and tanf was down a little bit so um
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
there there's fluctuations within um
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
can i go ahead or yeah just just go on
 
04:12:57.120 --> 04:12:57.990 align:start position:0%
can i go ahead or yeah just just go on
listen

04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
listen
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
until you say something okay um and
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
here's where we are budgeted
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
um there we go representative
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure uh chris
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
at some point could we get a report
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
about how much is in the tanf reserve
 
04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
fund mary do you or karen do you want to
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
report on the tanf
 
04:13:21.359 --> 04:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
report on the tanf
balance

04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
sure um the tanf balance is currently
 
04:13:27.760 --> 04:13:28.469 align:start position:0%
sure um the tanf balance is currently
around

04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars um we expect it'll be
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit lower than that by the end
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year
 
04:13:38.309 --> 04:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
um but that's where it currently is it
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit higher than we estimated
 
04:13:40.399 --> 04:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit higher than we estimated
it

04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
was going to be this biennium when we
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
talked about it last biennium we were
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
coming close to we estimated that the at
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the end of this biennium it would be
 
04:13:49.600 --> 04:13:50.070 align:start position:0%
the end of this biennium it would be
around

04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
14 or 15 million dollars um
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
two things that have affected that the
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
most one is case loads being
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
lower than anticipated and uh chris
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
could speak to why case loads might be
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
lower than we anticipated
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
and um second being that we did
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
not use tanf uh tanf was not needed
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
in the child care budget um which
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think was budgeted several million
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so that
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
um increased the tanf
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
balance as well and we also karen
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
reduced the contracts that we were
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
paying out of tanf
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
and um as a whole in the department
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
and we really focused on you know those
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
that met the four goals of tanf um
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
to really streamline what um contracts
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
we use
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
that funding for and chris can you speak
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
to the tan of caseloads being lower than
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
intel yeah
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
so um this is actually um it's it's
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
actually interesting
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
because i've been working on this our
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
numbers are lower and
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
what was kind of fascinating
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
to me is last night i was starting to
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
get emails from the other new england
 
04:15:02.560 --> 04:15:03.349 align:start position:0%
get emails from the other new england
states

04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
um and we do a lot of that right like
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
what do your numbers look like and they
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
all have lower tanf numbers
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and everybody's trying to figure this
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
out because we're in a
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
we have you know an economic crisis with
 
04:15:15.199 --> 04:15:16.070 align:start position:0%
we have you know an economic crisis with
covid

04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
you know so what's going on so what
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things that are
 
04:15:22.239 --> 04:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things that are
happening

04:15:23.110 --> 04:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
um the first piece is that
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
with tanf um
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
a number you have to be working to
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
access tanf there are certain work
 
04:15:33.439 --> 04:15:34.229 align:start position:0%
access tanf there are certain work
requirements

04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
and so um while unemployment is
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
up people are actually making
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
getting more money with unemployment and
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
assistant federal unemployment so that
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily needing the tanf
 
04:15:50.159 --> 04:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily needing the tanf
money

04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
also we've been providing a ton of
 
04:15:54.319 --> 04:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
also we've been providing a ton of
resources

04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
through our snap program federal
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
resources for
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic ebt which provides
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
cash assistance snap dollars for
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
families who
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
have kids who are getting free and
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch or eligible for
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
we've been providing the maximum
 
04:16:13.279 --> 04:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
we've been providing the maximum
allotment

04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
allotment
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
for snap benefits which is a federal
 
04:16:16.880 --> 04:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
for snap benefits which is a federal
program

04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
we also have people who um have been
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
receiving the economic stimulus payments
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
so a number of people
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
um either aren't
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
applying for tanf right now we actually
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
had some bumps where people applied when
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment went down
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
when there was a gap but we have not
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
seen increases
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
we do feel and we believe
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
that once the additional unemployment
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
once the um snap benefits go back to
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic there's going to be an
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
increase of
 
04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
people applying for tanf um
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's just something that we we're kind
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
of waiting for that to happen and we've
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
been waiting for it actually throughout
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
but at this point it doesn't seem that
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
people are
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
applying because they're not needing
 
04:17:14.070 --> 04:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
other resources right this minute that
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that
 
04:17:19.110 --> 04:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
in three weeks four weeks a month people
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair fwoc families with older
 
04:17:37.199 --> 04:17:38.309 align:start position:0%
mr chair fwoc families with older
children

04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
how old what are the age limits and uh
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
how do they qualify
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
so mary police can you jump in because i
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up do you are you
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to have a follow-up or is that
 
04:18:10.319 --> 04:18:14.389 align:start position:0%
going to have a follow-up or is that
just

04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm sorry could you
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
repeat the question
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes families with older children qualify
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
for some programs
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
what are the ages to be older children
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
how what's the range of ages and how do
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
they have to be in high school
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's up to age 19 but it
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:18:38.399 --> 04:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
may be
20.

04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
i would have to go back and research
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
obviously there isn't there isn't
 
04:19:01.110 --> 04:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the numbers every
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
program so so you specialize for some
 
04:19:04.000 --> 04:19:04.550 align:start position:0%
program so so you specialize for some
reason

04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you we can go back and get
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the history for you
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i believe it was a way to help
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
families transition
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
slowly um off of tanf while they still
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
had children in high school
 
04:19:21.189 --> 04:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
but we can go back and get the actual
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the program was established it is a
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
relatively small number
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
normally if you're a family getting
 
04:19:27.279 --> 04:19:28.950 align:start position:0%
normally if you're a family getting
assistance

04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
and the only child you have possibly
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
achieves the age of 18 which is
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
supposedly a legal age
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
so they that would not be counted then
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
in other words you're no longer children
 
04:19:47.590 --> 04:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
right this just but the child unless
 
04:19:49.110 --> 04:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're still in high school and you
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
still have needs
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
right so these are they have to still be
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's the um piece it's the
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's really the high school component
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
which allows the eligibility in this
 
04:20:01.680 --> 04:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
which allows the eligibility in this
program

04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.110 --> 04:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
can i go well no we have a couple
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions okay
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is a great slide we got everyone
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
going now good uh
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
well then don't don't turn mary kalis
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
off then because she has the wealth of
 
04:20:19.680 --> 04:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
off then because she has the wealth of
information

04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
sorry um is this one of the programs we
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
raised to age
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh last time i think
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
there were some programs that were 16
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
and i think we raised age is this
 
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
one of them in the in the last budget
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah no not in these we've actually
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
haven't raised
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the age in these that i'm aware of okay
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
must have been another program thank you
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
you're welcome the dcyf program we
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
raised the age for
 
04:21:01.110 --> 04:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature to raise the age for
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you
 
04:21:11.110 --> 04:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like in your case loads fy21
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
december 2020 actual your total column
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.840 --> 04:21:21.990 align:start position:0%
 
column

04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
column
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
on the previous slide it does look like
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
there's an error there
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
on the tana row well another column the
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
under the total column and the under the
 
04:21:31.840 --> 04:21:32.469 align:start position:0%
under the total column and the under the
blue

04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
blue
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll have to uh fix that
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
but it's consistent yep right are there
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right so you're you're free to

caseload that's this doesn't
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
we get lots of questions about this um
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted to put that in here
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
um the um snap um
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
we had an increase in expenses because
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
we created
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of snap benefit programs emergency
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
allotment pandemic ebt
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
plus there was a 15
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
increase in benefits so i just wanted to
 
04:22:31.680 --> 04:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
increase in benefits so i just wanted to
show

04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
show
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
you um the average caseload we still
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
are not seeing a huge increase in
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
snap due to the pandemic early on
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic the additional hundred
 
04:22:45.600 --> 04:22:47.189 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic the additional hundred
dollars

04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
was um counted towards snap and now the
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
additional unemployment is not
 
04:22:57.189 --> 04:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
counted in snap um but i just wanted to
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the costs shot up and i understand
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
does that was were those funds coveted
 
04:23:13.760 --> 04:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
does that was were those funds coveted
funds

04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
there so rebecca can yeah these were all
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
covered related for
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
the um emergency allotment pandemic ebt
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the increase in our benefits yes it
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
is not
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
does not impact us so just kind of a
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
general question
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
how would we see how the coveted funds
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
were accounted for
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
do they not appear in anything we're
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at here either historically or
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
rebecca and karen
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the covet in here i
 
04:23:45.760 --> 04:23:46.710 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the covet in here i
believe

04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
i believe it's just go ahead karen sorry
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say most of our
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
coded funding we put into separate
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and so because we're not continuing
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
to budget those those would not show up
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
so can you just get us an account of the
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion dollars
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
roughly uh so if you're talking about
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
the 1.2 that gopher received
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
gopher would need to provide that for
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
you i can provide for you
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
what um the department received okay
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's why that's my legacy okay this
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
year the
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year i believe the 20 and 21
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
are the um coveted related um funds
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
for snap benefits me i mean generally
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
across the whole
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
yeah hhs chris could i please add that
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
we don't budget the snap grant dollars
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
at all that we have administrative
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of the letter of credit
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
but that we do not include the dollars
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
paid for food stamp benefits in our
 
04:24:56.080 --> 04:24:57.429 align:start position:0%
paid for food stamp benefits in our
budget

04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the vendors square up with the
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
contract provider and the contract
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
provider squares up with the federal
 
04:25:04.479 --> 04:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
provider squares up with the federal
government

04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay can i go is it okay to go to the
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
04:25:19.260 --> 04:25:19.270 align:start position:0%
could i just could i just
 
04:25:19.270 --> 04:25:21.189 align:start position:0%
could i just could i just
[Music]

04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
um representative irf i was going to say
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
you can look at
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
um how the gopher funds how all those
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
funds at two point that 1.25
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
billion dollars was spent by going to
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
the gopher website
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
and also um the lba has been tracking
 
04:25:37.520 --> 04:25:38.389 align:start position:0%
and also um the lba has been tracking
them

04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and um they they might be able to
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
provide us with a uh
 
04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
with a reporting of the um
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
how those funds all went and were used
 
04:25:49.990 --> 04:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you you actually i can send out a
 
04:25:55.110 --> 04:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
link on our website we update weekly
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh a spreadsheet of all federal covert
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
funding it's not specific to the
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
department it's statewide and it may not
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
be down to the level of detail that
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
you're looking for but i think you may
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm can i and can i go to the next slide
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and this here is just
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers of people served in the new
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment program
 
04:26:24.630 --> 04:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a direct correlation because
 
04:26:24.640 --> 04:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
and there's a direct correlation because
this

04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
program focuses on individuals receiving
 
04:26:27.600 --> 04:26:28.469 align:start position:0%
program focuses on individuals receiving
tanf

04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
tanf
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
um so a decrease in tanf numbers would
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
result in a decrease
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire employment program
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there's been a
 
04:26:38.640 --> 04:26:40.070 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there's been a
decrease

04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
during 20 and into 21.
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
and i would just add that the increase
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
that you see from 17 to 18 if you
 
04:26:47.439 --> 04:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
that you see from 17 to 18 if you
remember

04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
when we presented the department-wide
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
presentation there was a change in tan
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
of eligibility
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and who is eligible from 17 to 18 during
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
that legislative session
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that's why the numbers increased
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you karen
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
you remember generally what the nature
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
we could get that for you it was in
 
04:27:16.080 --> 04:27:17.030 align:start position:0%
we could get that for you it was in
legislation

04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact amount of the
 
04:27:20.239 --> 04:27:21.110 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact amount of the
change

04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
do any of the legislators remember what
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh how long ago it would have been
 
04:27:33.309 --> 04:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
during the
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
2017 session because it became effective
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
in 18.
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
there was one way we changed if there
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
were two parents in a household
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
who was treated differently than ever
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
this was actually an increase of the
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
tanf um
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
grant and i don't have the exact
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
percentage um that we went
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
up i don't know if mary kalise has it
 
04:28:00.399 --> 04:28:00.710 align:start position:0%
up i don't know if mary kalise has it
but

04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
i might have it on a piece of paper
 
04:28:08.229 --> 04:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
um or rebecca might know but i can get
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
that for you yeah we can get that far
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
mary's on another call
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
right now okay but we can
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
find it for you i can get that as well
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
two from 2017 i think okay that'd be
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
great kevin thank you
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
because it changed the amount of the
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
tana grant but it also changed the
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh the federal the ffp percentage
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
so it changed the number of people
 
04:28:33.750 --> 04:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
eligible as well as the amount they
 
04:28:33.760 --> 04:28:34.830 align:start position:0%
eligible as well as the amount they
received

04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
received
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
um all right um so just um
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit about bfa um these are the
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
programs it
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
really the is access eligibility access
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
and determination for these programs
 
04:28:54.479 --> 04:28:55.030 align:start position:0%
and determination for these programs
here

04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is primarily on top of the policy
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
work on that bfa
 
04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
um does and then when we move to the
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
bureau of employment
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
supports they provide
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
tanf recipients are required
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
to participate in a work program so in
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
order to continue
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
to receive assistance for tanf you need
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
in a work program and so here's some of
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
the resources that we provide
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
in addition to connecting people with
 
04:29:29.680 --> 04:29:30.710 align:start position:0%
in addition to connecting people with
other

04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
work programs within the state
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
so career guidance these are some of the
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
barrier reduction services that we
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
will be providing and we also partner
 
04:29:43.680 --> 04:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
will be providing and we also partner
with

04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
businesses such as like cbs
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
around getting people into career
 
04:29:49.680 --> 04:29:50.790 align:start position:0%
around getting people into career
pathways

04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
pathways
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
and working on some of those barrier
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
reduction services
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a program for
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on snap
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
which is the food stamps and that's a
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary program
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
and that's really helping people
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
obtain jobs such as job search materials
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
resumes assistance with transportation
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
to help people access employment who are
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
on snap
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
so if uh if refugees
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
get ebt cards is that under this or is
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
it somewhere else
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
if a person if a refugee receives an ebt
 
04:30:34.469 --> 04:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
card they're either getting snap
 
04:30:35.670 --> 04:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
benefits or
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
tanf financial assistance
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
is was that the question yes
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay i was just curious if there was
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
another because earlier
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh in all of these briefings we covered
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
a refugee
 
04:30:57.750 --> 04:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh budget line uh and i just was curious
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
where the ebts would be budgeted
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like montana for snap and not
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
back in the other account
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to double check on that
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
because i do know we have a couple of
 
04:31:09.600 --> 04:31:10.309 align:start position:0%
because i do know we have a couple of
small

04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
um programs that are targeted um
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that may be one of them and i
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually think
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm thinking out loud which is
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
always dangerous for me
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that there's actually some
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
pass-through money
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
that comes through um into bfa to
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
provide supports for individuals um
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
on that with the um refugee cash
 
04:31:33.680 --> 04:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
on that with the um refugee cash
assistance

04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
so so the related background question
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
around that is are we
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
are we properly anticipating the
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
refugee population that's expected in
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
so i will have to get back with you on
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
that um i don't have the answer to that
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right i'm gonna
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
um service delivery um we provide
 
04:32:06.960 --> 04:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
um service delivery um we provide
services

04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%

04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
through our district offices and so um
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have staff in all of the 11 district
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%

04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
units here in concord
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
all services through bfa are done
 
04:32:23.600 --> 04:32:24.229 align:start position:0%

allows people to apply and access their

04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
statewide and it's a combination of
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
our own state employees in the district
 
04:32:52.880 --> 04:32:53.830 align:start position:0%

southern new hampshire services

04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of the accomplishments over this
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
is to be honest with you within
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
this program area we transitioned to
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
working fully
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
remote without any disruption to
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving services when the
 
04:33:21.279 --> 04:33:23.109 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving services when the
pandemic

04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
you know first hit we started to reduce
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
foot traffic in the district offices
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of people that
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
come in and out of the district offices
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
and so we reduce the number of people
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
coming in and then we transition
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
to remote and and people
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
are are still able to apply and we've
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
received a number of waivers from our
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
federal partners
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
to allow allow us to do appointments by
 
04:33:50.400 --> 04:33:51.349 align:start position:0%
to allow allow us to do appointments by
phone

04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
phone
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
um we do receive faxes you know
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
email online um everything we were able
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
um to do we were able to do remotely
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
and so we have continued to do interview
 
04:34:04.400 --> 04:34:05.429 align:start position:0%
and so we have continued to do interview
appointments

04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
on the phone and then face to face if
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
requested and if um needed and then
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of this actually is
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
individuals have increased their use of
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire easy
 
04:34:19.269 --> 04:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
which is much easier for people to
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
upload their information and access
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
their benefits
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
um we representative erf has a question
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
are you getting a good break spot
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure do you see that continuing
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
post covert if we ever get there the
 
04:34:33.119 --> 04:34:33.990 align:start position:0%
post covert if we ever get there the
reminder

04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
reminder
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
working remote um so it's it's funny
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
um because i can remember meeting with
 
04:34:40.240 --> 04:34:41.109 align:start position:0%
um because i can remember meeting with
staff

04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
like two months before the pandemic
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
saying oh we would love the ability to
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
just work at home
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
once in a while um and we kind of
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
laughed i'm like i'm with it
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
but it's probably going to take us a
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
couple years to get there and then
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
three weeks you know we were able to
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
roll it out i
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
i don't we're never going to be in this
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
area 100
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
remote but i do think we will be able to
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
um some hybrid models because there is
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
value with people being together in the
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
office but yet
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's also value with people being
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
able to do certain aspects of their job
 
04:35:16.320 --> 04:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
able to do certain aspects of their job
remotely

04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we've worked through all the kinks
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
how you know the the systems work
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
because they're pretty um
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
complicated but um we're always gonna
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to have people have the ability to
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
come into district offices and meet
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with people because that's
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
really essential
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
um but i think we'll have some type of
 
04:35:37.199 --> 04:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
um but i think we'll have some type of
mix

04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
mix
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
um when we're out of this does that
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
allow for space reduction
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
um that is something we actually have
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
talked about um and we've talked about
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
with facilities that
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
you know we might not need as much
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
bricks and mortar and have maybe more
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
shared space
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
so are you looking at it hard enough to
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
where we can reduce the rents budget for
 
04:36:01.830 --> 04:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
two years probably not um and that's not
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
something that you know that's what
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
something we'd be doing
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with facilities um
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um uh kevin kevin can you bring over
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
lori weaver
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
she could definitely speak to that
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
is she out there or is she just oh wow
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
must be a slow day i doubt that she's
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
probably doing multiple things at once
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
lori are you there
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
she's a panelist i'll put it that way
 
04:36:55.750 --> 04:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's very possible that she stepped
 
04:36:57.429 --> 04:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
away from her desk and
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
and kept us up while she was doing
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
something else so
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can come back to her when
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
she becomes available
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah um so another accomplishment
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
is we
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
have increased access to nutritious food
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
by the snap pandemic ebt
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that was in collaboration with
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
and we're actually at the point of
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
getting ready to submit another pandemic
 
04:37:24.879 --> 04:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
getting ready to submit another pandemic
ebt

04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
ebt
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
plan to food and nutrition services
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
we actually began participating in the
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
online purchasing program in july
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
which was a response to the cobin 19
 
04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic when people didn't want to go
 
04:37:39.920 --> 04:37:40.789 align:start position:0%
pandemic when people didn't want to go
out

04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
to stores but i definitely think this is
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
something we're going to continue
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of people who
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
receive snap benefits who
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
may not have transportation maybe
 
04:37:52.400 --> 04:37:53.349 align:start position:0%
may not have transportation maybe
elderly

04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
maybe have young children so that's
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
definitely been a positive
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
benefit that we want to continue
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've actually another accomplishment is
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
i mentioned i think earlier we
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
have assisted people in our
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire employment program
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
received their high school diploma or
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
equivalency this year
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
um so that was a real big benefit 128
 
04:38:20.719 --> 04:38:21.189 align:start position:0%
um so that was a real big benefit 128
people

04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
and finally we continue to enhance our
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration with other statewide work
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
programs and so
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
really working on what are the other
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
programs that people can access
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
so that we can ensure people have access
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
can i go to the next slide yes
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes you may okay thank you um some of
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
our key challenges
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
are just the continued need for
 
04:38:51.199 --> 04:38:53.029 align:start position:0%
are just the continued need for
technology

04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
to support the work of our employees and
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
enhance our customer service
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's really where we need to
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
continue to spend time and energy on
 
04:39:03.600 --> 04:39:04.551 align:start position:0%
continue to spend time and energy on
that

04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
staff vacancies and turnover are
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
larger in this area of our division and
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
i will get you those vacancy
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
numbers but because these are
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
entry-level positions so
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
lots of people will come in um and you
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
know use this as a stepping stone which
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
is great for other
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
parts of the department but it kind of
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
causes some vacancies in this area
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
a challenge is always to focus on staff
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
training i think we really need to focus
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
on enhancing our training
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
and how it's being provided again one of
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
the things we learned about with covid
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
is um you know how to do things on zoom
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
right i don't think many of you thought
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago we'd be doing division
 
04:39:53.040 --> 04:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
two years ago we'd be doing division
three

04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
um finance on zoom um and so
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
how do we and how do we continue some of
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
that training
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
for our staff so that people don't have
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
to drive
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
to get access to training and then
 
04:40:06.718 --> 04:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
to get access to training and then
finally

04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
finally
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
we talked about this earlier with our
 
04:40:10.560 --> 04:40:11.190 align:start position:0%
we talked about this earlier with our
division

04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
overview is the cliff effect i mean that
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
is a challenge
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
is how do we what policies do we
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
look to change so that people
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to work be successful
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
but don't end up being worse off for
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
their family and essential services so
 
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
that is a challenge that we're working
 
04:40:33.200 --> 04:40:33.990 align:start position:0%
that is a challenge that we're working
through

04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
um and i look forward to continuing our
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
work in this because that will be
 
04:40:37.760 --> 04:40:40.708 align:start position:0%
work in this because that will be
critical

04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.750 --> 04:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
any adults any questions
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
great so now i'm going to go to your
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
favorite slide
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
um so we actually have
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
some benchmarks so for our food stamp
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there's actually national standards
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
that say you have to be
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
at six percent is the um
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
lowest you can that's like where you
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
have to be below that
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
for errors and so we are currently at
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
4.92 percent
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
so that is really a good we are actually
 
04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
ranked fifth in the nation
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
um for our payment um accuracy
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
can i just point out on this slide that
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
the first two
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
circles there yeah what what's listed in
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
workload feels more like
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
a quality standard if you look at the
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
third one
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have you have a workload standard in
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
the third one but not the first two
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay but no this is like
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
it's great yeah and i mean i think part
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
of that is tied to our workload and so i
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
can actually get what our case loads are
 
04:41:54.310 --> 04:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
but that helps us remain um in that
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
quality standard and the same with
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
application processing
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
um you know technical we are supposed to
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
have 90
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
of our applications received have to be
 
04:42:04.638 --> 04:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
of our applications received have to be
processed

04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
processed
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
within 30 to 45 days we're currently at
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
92 percent
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and much of that is it is beyond our
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
control but yet we still have to be
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
tracked if somebody cancels an
 
04:42:16.958 --> 04:42:17.910 align:start position:0%
tracked if somebody cancels an
appointment

04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody doesn't show up their
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
application doesn't get put in a
 
04:42:21.600 --> 04:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
application doesn't get put in a
different

04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
um pile um and so that's something that
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
we have to continue to work at
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
but i can get you the actual workload um
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
numbers we have here and by workload
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
just in case it's not clear i mean you
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
know what are the drivers of your
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the application processing so
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
i can tie that to that definitely
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see for our employment
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
supports um
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
we have about 50 to 60 participants for
 
04:42:58.798 --> 04:43:00.230 align:start position:0%
we have about 50 to 60 participants for
caseloads

04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
caseloads
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that one of the standards is that we
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
have 50 percent of our
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
participants have to attend to their
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
required hours weekly
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
so in order to participate in tanf and
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire employment supports you
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
actually have to be working
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
or engaged in training for um
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay whoops i am
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
good no questions okay here is our
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
budgets um that we're going to review
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
in our when we go through the budget
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
slides and so you'll see the majority of
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
our funds
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
are federal and general funds
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
and rebecca correct me if i'm wrong some
 
04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the other funds
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
used go towards our moes for medicaid
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
the other fund yes is that now
 
04:44:01.520 --> 04:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
the other fund yes is that now
sorry

04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
the other funds or the other funds
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
what are those um those
 
04:44:12.840 --> 04:44:20.470 align:start position:0%
what are those um those
are

04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's in the um
 
04:44:48.390 --> 04:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
tanf budget okay
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
i know there are other funds that we
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
collect okay
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
and use i can uh look into that a little
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get you that information so
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
use this slide to look at the right to
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
bubbles and the total funds
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
look to be about the same
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
but the percentage of state funds to
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds shifts dramatically
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
so so what's what's the underlying story
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
on a huge drop in federal funds and a
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
huge increase
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
in general funds
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
do you follow my question yeah i see it
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.628 --> 04:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
in um go ahead no please go ahead
 
04:45:52.638 --> 04:45:53.350 align:start position:0%
in um go ahead no please go ahead
rebecca

04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
rebecca
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
there's um it looks like we used
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
20 than we had
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
probably due to the covid because we
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
were using more federal dollars
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
than the general fund it actually looks
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
like rebecca that the general funds in
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
2021 might
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
be only one year where the 22 23 is two
 
04:46:18.480 --> 04:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
be only one year where the 22 23 is two
years

04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
just like taking a quick look okay i
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
think i think the middle chart is
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
incorrect and should actually be about
 
04:46:24.718 --> 04:46:25.350 align:start position:0%
incorrect and should actually be about
double

04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
double
 
04:46:28.150 --> 04:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
that mr chair and the reason that that
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
such an increase from 1819 to 2021
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
those that were on the committee last
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
year remember
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
that um and i've talked about it a
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
little bit when we did the department
 
04:46:41.120 --> 04:46:42.550 align:start position:0%
little bit when we did the department
wide

04:46:42.550 --> 04:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
wide
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
presentation that we budgeted in such a
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
way that now we can actually tell you
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
where every tanf budget
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollar is budgeted well the secondary
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
piece to that
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
is we now know where every dollar of moe
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
is budgeted which is about 30 to 34
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
million i always forget the exact number
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
and mary usually
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
sends me a text and tells me i said the
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
wrong number so i know it's in the
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know low 30s um and so
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
because of that new way we budgeted um
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
and this is where i usually check the
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
attendees although it's recorded so it
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's when we realized that we may not be
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
budgeting all of the moe
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we should have been and that we
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
might have a federal audit problem
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
because we were not
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
budgeting all the moe they are recorded
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i know and it's okay i think
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're past those audit ears for 18 19
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
i think we're okay because 2021 we
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
actually budgeted those dollars
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
um and actually made sure to spend those
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
to meet that moe and so that was the um
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
the increase that happened from 1819 to
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
2021 and like i said that 46 million
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
should actually probably be about double
 
04:47:52.400 --> 04:47:52.948 align:start position:0%
should actually probably be about double
that

04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah like that was just missing part of
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
the general funds
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
but we'll yeah okay so
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
then let's let's look at the left and
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
the right bubble
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the federal funds uh we went from
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
118 to 108
 
04:48:14.550 --> 04:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
so we're we are we are letting air out
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
of that bubble
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
so so what's going on there is a federal
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
government cutting back their percentage
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
or is that another
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
kind of accounting thing no that would
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
be because we're
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
we're budgeting the um the tanf based on
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
or i think we'll see it when we get into
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
the accounting units but my my
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
assumption is because we are budgeting
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
the tanf based on current caseloads
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
um which as uh the director mentioned
 
04:48:41.280 --> 04:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
um which as uh the director mentioned
have

04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
been lower this year than um have been
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the past so that would
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
the amount of general funds we have to
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
spend does not change
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
that low 30 million dollar number we
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to spend that whether we spend one
 
04:48:55.990 --> 04:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
dollar in tanf or spend
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
60 million in tanf um so
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
those those general funds will always be
 
04:49:01.440 --> 04:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
those those general funds will always be
budgeted

04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then the amount of federal will
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
become the becomes the variable amount
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.590 --> 04:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
you can keep keep going okay thank you
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
um so again here's our five percent
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
up and down um with additionals we would
 
04:49:20.240 --> 04:49:20.868 align:start position:0%
up and down um with additionals we would
actually

04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
increase the number of field staff
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can have
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
you know work meet some of our timelines
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
and workload balances
 
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
we would increase our training unit
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
staff and dollars in staff development
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
we would enhance the customer service
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
platform so more people can do
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
more online um
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so the training unit staff
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
i i i thought and this is from two terms
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
ago i i
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
thought that there was a
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
department in the new hampshire state
 
04:50:01.120 --> 04:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
department in the new hampshire state
government

04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
that basically owned training that they
 
04:50:04.798 --> 04:50:05.510 align:start position:0%
that basically owned training that they
were

04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
they were the training organization for
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
all state departments this sounds like
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
growing your training unit organically
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
within your
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
division so we so we actually within the
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
bureau of family assistance
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and this training is specific to
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
the eligibility programs that we have
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
so this is on eligibility program so
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
within our bureau of family assistance
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it's focused on
 
04:50:40.230 --> 04:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's on you know we have staff
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
need to know over like 40 programs so
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's how do you
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
figure out what somebody's eligible for
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
in medicaid
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
in snap um for child care so it's
 
04:50:50.798 --> 04:50:51.590 align:start position:0%
in snap um for child care so it's
specific

04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
to training to do their job um
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
so somebody in doit or d
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
dot doesn't need to know correct it's
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
um to um how do you process a case
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
in for eligibility
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
um and so um a decrease would be
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
impact on state on staff positions
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
loss of opportunity um
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
for technology enhancements we would
 
04:51:23.760 --> 04:51:24.390 align:start position:0%
for technology enhancements we would
slow

04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
slow
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
on the timeline for adapting program
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
services to meet
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
new employer needs and staff development
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
won't be enhanced to meet staff needs
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the um
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
up and down that we would have
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
same general comment if these could be
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
made measurable
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean these are nice general terms but
 
04:51:50.390 --> 04:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you um
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
here's the different accounting units um
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
within the budget briefing book
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the budget book which we're going to
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
go over
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
um now i believe with karen
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
and rebecca yes do you want to cover
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
your staffing slide at all
 
04:52:10.150 --> 04:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
oh sure um so just here
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
is our staffing we have a number of
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
different staff within
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
um within bfa so
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
there's 14 and office is an old term
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's really more of the the policy end
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the bureau family assistance
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
we have 32 people working in the bureau
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
of employment supports as employment
 
04:52:34.878 --> 04:52:35.830 align:start position:0%
of employment supports as employment
counselors

04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
we have 370 employees out in the
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
district offices doing field
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
operations that's the eligibility
 
04:52:43.040 --> 04:52:44.310 align:start position:0%
operations that's the eligibility
workers

04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
one person under community service block
 
04:52:46.638 --> 04:52:47.590 align:start position:0%
one person under community service block
grant

04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
grant
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
we have 22 people in new heights
 
04:52:53.910 --> 04:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we have 16 people in our disability
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
determination unit
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
is our staffing so it's a pretty big
 
04:53:02.000 --> 04:53:05.110 align:start position:0%
is our staffing so it's a pretty big
bureau

04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to stop my screen sharing
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i think and enable karen
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
to do hers
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you chris thank you
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative wallner has a question
 
04:53:20.400 --> 04:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
representative wallner has a question
before

04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
um so chris it was just on your um
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
slide with all the employees i think we
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
saw that we talked about that before but
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
so most of those employees
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually were not were considered to be
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
front line
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh workers so that you did not have to
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
have the hiring freeze with most of them
 
04:53:43.200 --> 04:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
have the hiring freeze with most of them
right

04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
right so for the employment support
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
those 32
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
those were direct service the 370 were
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
direct service
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the and the 16 for the
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
disability determination unit those were
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
all direct service i have one
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
i have one further question for her
 
04:54:06.550 --> 04:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the 370 and the 16
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the direct service ones what you have
 
04:54:16.550 --> 04:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
were you able to figure out what the
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't i will go back and get
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
that for you
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
right after um if that's okay um
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
i will provide that to the committee and
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
i just one more about that
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
how many cases is a worker is one of
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
your eligibility
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
workers carrying and is it within sort
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
of a national
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
standard so the hard thing
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
is um is
 
04:54:58.868 --> 04:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
i'm i have the i don't have the caseload
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
handy and so i will provide that with
 
04:55:01.680 --> 04:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
handy and so i will provide that with
you

04:55:01.990 --> 04:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
following um but the hard thing is
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
because i've looked at this
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
a hundred times um from front to back
 
04:55:16.390 --> 04:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
and because we do integrated eligibility
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to find a national
 
04:55:18.878 --> 04:55:20.948 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to find a national
standard

04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
because most states
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
do not have eligibility as integrated as
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
and um so for instance when we were
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
working with the consultants you know
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
they paired us with a couple other
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
states and
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
they did everything except for you know
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
snap and tanf were done differently so
 
04:55:41.670 --> 04:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
hard um to compare us to um
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
other states but i will get you that
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
information great
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chris yep so the overall
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for this
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
euro is 12 percent okay
 
04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
and again again when you say you're
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to get representative walnut
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
information you're saying you're going
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
to get it to mr ripple and he's going to
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee gets it
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes i will thank you even if it was for
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
one representative i always provide it
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
to kevin so he
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
generally distributes it to the whole
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we
 
04:56:26.550 --> 04:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
are starting at
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 6125
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
and here is accounting unit 6125
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the director's office looks like it's
 
04:56:57.270 --> 04:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
going up 4.9
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it's adding two unclassified
 
04:56:59.920 --> 04:57:00.948 align:start position:0%
and it's adding two unclassified
positions

04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
is that is that right yes those were
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
previously budgeted in a different
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so they're being moved
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
they came from 79 96
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
which is in their same budget overall
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
it's just a different accounting unit
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i did provide kevin um the list of
 
04:57:22.868 --> 04:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
all of the positions that have been
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
moved in the department
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
so those two coming over to is that
 
04:57:38.310 --> 04:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
really the baseline for why
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything else might be shifting like
 
04:57:40.320 --> 04:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
anything else might be shifting like
benefits

04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions here okay
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
the next one is uh 6127 which is
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
so this was the one that's the big drop
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
in federal money and a big
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
jump in state money
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the overall budget is
 
04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
reduced though so that would
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
so here the the 9.75 is what was
 
04:58:42.320 --> 04:58:43.510 align:start position:0%
so here the the 9.75 is what was
budgeted

04:58:43.510 --> 04:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
and it's being reduced to 6.1 so this
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
goes back to what chris was talking
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
about earlier about
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we're using the funds for
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
their most core purposes
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
if i might add on the other funds in
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 that was for
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
um with a granite workforce
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we that didn't pass so we did re
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the budget yes the work program
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
for granite workforce was in this
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
accounting unit yes
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
so you're saying in 21 it went from 1.3
 
04:59:24.160 --> 04:59:24.708 align:start position:0%
so you're saying in 21 it went from 1.3
million

04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:59:28.708 --> 04:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
to to just 11 000.
 
04:59:28.718 --> 04:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
to to just 11 000.
correct

04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
where's the 11 000 coming from if
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
granite workforce wasn't passed
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
what line you all looking at rebecca's
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative fonti ask your
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
question in parallel
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay part of it relates to what you okay
 
05:00:12.160 --> 05:00:12.788 align:start position:0%
okay part of it relates to what you okay
um

05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
expense uh number 049 this one cares
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.840 --> 05:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
agencies

05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
karen isn't that new hampshire
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
05:00:26.470 --> 05:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
i was thinking that's what it is but uh
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
we need rebecca to confirm
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
to confirm that but i believe that's
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
what it is that's fine
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
and what language yes what what expense
 
05:00:34.160 --> 05:00:34.708 align:start position:0%
and what language yes what what expense
line

05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
what number here on that
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
049 transfer to other state agencies it
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
look that looks like it's going up
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
about 13 between the budgets on an
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty big jump what what's
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'll get that information for you i
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
but where were you looking with the with
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
the 1.3 million to 11 000. what line was
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
that on jess
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
oh what started this was uh
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
my looking at just the general funds
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
versus the federal funds
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
from budget to budget where
 
05:01:26.788 --> 05:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the in the current budget
 
05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
state funds is about 29 of the total
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
in in in next budget it's going to be 43
 
05:01:33.520 --> 05:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
in in in next budget it's going to be 43
percent

05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're my total funds but there was a
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
you threw around numbers 1.3 million to
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
11 000. where was that
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
oh um that was in here
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
975. that's your transfers
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's the that's here it's the yeah if
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
you look here on the screen where it
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
shows the different types of revenues
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
the 1.3 was here in fiscal year 21
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
and is now 11 000. okay
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll follow up with both of those
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
questions what this 11 000 is
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
as well as the uh transfers to other
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies and why that's increasing
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
thanks and i'm sorry which line is it
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about the
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
other state agencies the transfer to
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
other state agencies do you happen to
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
know where that's going and why it
 
05:02:23.120 --> 05:02:24.390 align:start position:0%
know where that's going and why it
increased

05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
double or i think the question
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
ms rounds is is more like if the granite
 
05:02:30.718 --> 05:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
ms rounds is is more like if the granite
workforce

05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
prop program went away then what is this
 
05:02:34.798 --> 05:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
prop program went away then what is this
11

05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
11
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
000. if there's no program there it
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
should be zero
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes that's one question i thought the
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
second question was
 
05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
why did the transfer to other state
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
agencies go up correct
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes online their
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
expenses 49. okay 45.
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
so we we can we can get those later
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay we will get both of those answers
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
for you
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
so those are our payments that are paid
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire employment securities
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
they provide us with the numbers so we
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
align our budget with theirs
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
what are they providing for services
 
05:03:17.760 --> 05:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
what are they providing for services
chris

05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
chris
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
oh it's online access cross match
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a bunch of things that we
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a number of
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
mlus i can get a summary of that um so i
 
05:03:28.958 --> 05:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
mlus i can get a summary of that um so i
don't

05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
um misspeak it's related to working and
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
accessing benefits and all of that stuff
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
and unemployment
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure this isn't happening but
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
i could imagine a really creative
 
05:03:43.760 --> 05:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
i could imagine a really creative
accounting

05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
where one department in division one
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
charges a department in division three
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
much more money so that there's more
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
money in the state
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
system as a result of it because i don't
 
05:04:00.550 --> 05:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
have time to go coordinate with division
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
one to find out what's going on
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
so absolutely i can assure you that i
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
would not pay an agency more than
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
they need to provide the services to us
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
i i would throw a stink about that
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
because that
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
affects my budget and affects my ability
 
05:04:14.878 --> 05:04:15.910 align:start position:0%
affects my budget and affects my ability
to

05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
operate the entire budget so i would
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely not allow that to happen
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
i believe that thank you for that and
 
05:04:25.430 --> 05:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i exposed one of my cynical
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
sides to you
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's okay we all have fun about
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
different things so totally
 
05:04:30.840 --> 05:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
different things so totally
understandable

05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to continue on the
 
05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
next budget area
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
sure so the next accounting unit is 6146
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
which is tanf the temporary assistance
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
what i would mention is we did have a
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
prioritized need
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 only for
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand dollars were about
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand dollars under
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
the required moe um so you will see that
 
05:05:03.520 --> 05:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
the required moe um so you will see that
on

05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet of all of the
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized means which
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
i should have to early next week okay i
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you saying that um while
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm making notes in the excel sheet
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
could you tell me
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
what funding line or what expense line
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're gonna want the money in so i
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
believe that would go in class line 501
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
correct payments to clients yes
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
so the note there is you think this is
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
600 000 low
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
yes well the general fund piece is
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
so um it would reduce the federal funds
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
by 600 000 and increase the general
 
05:05:42.240 --> 05:05:43.910 align:start position:0%
by 600 000 and increase the general
funds

05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
oh so the the actual expenditure would
 
05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
not change
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
that just the fund mix would change down
 
05:05:51.200 --> 05:05:54.948 align:start position:0%
that just the fund mix would change down
here

05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
why can't we do it the other way and get
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
we we definitely draw down every other
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
federal dollar we can
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
um but we do have to spend the entire
 
05:06:07.600 --> 05:06:08.550 align:start position:0%
um but we do have to spend the entire
moe

05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
moe
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
mj has a question don't tell me moe
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
again what's that miranda
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay maintenance of effort all right so
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
um representative uh walner has her hand
 
05:06:22.958 --> 05:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
um representative uh walner has her hand
up

05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah karen
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes so can you talk for a minute i i
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
maybe you have already gone over this
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
with the division but can you
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about maintenance of
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
effort and what it means
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
i mean what do we put at risk if we
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
don't meet our maintenance with effort
 
05:06:46.550 --> 05:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
sure so um it's a common
 
05:06:47.910 --> 05:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
match and moe are the same thing they
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
are slightly different
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
and uh it's something that i quite
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
frankly didn't understand when i first
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
started with the department either and
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
and mary had to spend a lot of time with
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
me saying you cannot use those words
 
05:07:02.550 --> 05:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
interchangeably they're two very
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
different things
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so match is uh a percentage
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
that if you spend a federal federal
 
05:07:10.958 --> 05:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
that if you spend a federal federal
dollar

05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
you have to spend a general fund dollar
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 50 50. so it's a dollar
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
to a dollar
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 25.75 or 90 10.
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
or lots of other various percentages um
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
so that is a match and moe is that you
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
have to spend that much in general funds
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of how many federal dollars
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
you spend
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
so there is a slight difference there
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
there can also be changes to the moe for
 
05:07:38.080 --> 05:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
there can also be changes to the moe for
example

05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
under the cares act
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
to receive the enhanced fmap and
 
05:07:44.878 --> 05:07:45.990 align:start position:0%
to receive the enhanced fmap and
medicaid

05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
part of the required maintenance of
 
05:07:48.400 --> 05:07:49.110 align:start position:0%
part of the required maintenance of
effort

05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
is to not take anyone off of medicaid
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that's not really a
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
general fund that must be spent kind of
 
05:07:58.320 --> 05:07:58.868 align:start position:0%
general fund that must be spent kind of
moe

05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
moe
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's actually an activity that we have
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:08:04.550 --> 05:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
for moe and as we get down into some of
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the other programs
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
like um uh
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
apt that's similar it's not that the
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
federal government says you have to
 
05:08:13.680 --> 05:08:14.550 align:start position:0%
federal government says you have to
spend

05:08:14.550 --> 05:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
spend
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
you know 10 million dollars on aptb they
 
05:08:16.958 --> 05:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
you know 10 million dollars on aptb they
say

05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:08:20.070 --> 05:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have this program and so
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it costs to run that program is
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
what it costs to run the program so
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
so that's where moe and match are a
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
little bit different
 
05:08:30.310 --> 05:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
a really great explanation so it's like
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
moe is the fixed
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
cost where you've got you got to get
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
into the program
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then the match is really sort of
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
like the variable cost to get
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
additional federal money yes the the
 
05:08:44.230 --> 05:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
match is directly tied to
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
how many federal dollars you spend
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
but the moe can vary
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
based on whether it's an moe to run a
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
program or an moe of a fixed amount of
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
dollars you must spend
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get a good deal out of it i
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
remember in division two
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
school lunches when we first started
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
with school lunches it was like a
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
one-on-one match
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then it became a maintenance of
 
05:09:11.440 --> 05:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
and then it became a maintenance of
effort

05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
and by the time 20 years went by
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
the uh maintenance effort was
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the same but the federal funds
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
were about 10 times more
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
so sometimes the maintenance of effort
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
is you know just you got to make some
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
little effort but they're
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
giving you more money every year but the
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort sometimes it's a
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
historical thing
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change every year whereas
 
05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
match likely does
 
05:09:38.840 --> 05:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
match likely does
yes

05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
i wish i had more programs that that
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
happened where the moe stayed the same
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
for lots and lots and lots of years uh
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
that is true of tanf that
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
has been the same oe for many many years
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
that is also a very high moe so so
 
05:09:56.240 --> 05:09:57.270 align:start position:0%
that is also a very high moe so so
representative

05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
your hands up is that a follow-up or
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
just an artifact
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
a far it's a follow-up actually karen
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
i would we've had like i was just going
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
to say that we have had this maintenance
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
of effort
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
um for a number of years and it was a
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
formula set
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
do you have what do you remember what
 
05:10:21.680 --> 05:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
do you have what do you remember what
that

05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
what that what what that formula was
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
um i did not i was just looking to see
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
if man
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
mary is still a panelist it looks like
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
she's not in her other meeting anymore
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
i bet mary remembers yeah because i
 
05:10:38.000 --> 05:10:38.868 align:start position:0%
i bet mary remembers yeah because i
think

05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's from when we when tana
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
started it's with the same formula and
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
moe um and we didn't have
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
one penalty though in like
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna get the year right it was
 
05:10:54.150 --> 05:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
the 80s or 90s there was a small penalty
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see that mary's typing to me so
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
she if i could i don't know the formula
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
but i think the moe and the federal
 
05:11:07.830 --> 05:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
grant were both put in place in the 1996
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
federal uh welfare reform bill and it'd
 
05:11:11.830 --> 05:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
been the same ever since
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
and i i would i would add there's been
 
05:11:18.638 --> 05:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
and i i would i would add there's been
at

05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
many times where uh reform has been
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
added to current bills
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
at the federal level and so far no
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
changes have been made to it but it's
 
05:11:27.040 --> 05:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
changes have been made to it but it's
something

05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:11:30.070 --> 05:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
i know chris monitors i monitor mary
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
monitors because um
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
changes the program would affect us yeah
 
05:11:36.150 --> 05:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
05:11:38.708 --> 05:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
we keep on preparing for tana freoth and
 
05:11:40.470 --> 05:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
it keeps on getting extended and
 
05:11:40.480 --> 05:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
it keeps on getting extended and
extended

05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
extended
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:06.390 --> 05:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
which is on the bottom of page 976 and
 
05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
of 977 as chris mentioned earlier in her
 
05:12:10.320 --> 05:12:11.510 align:start position:0%
of 977 as chris mentioned earlier in her
presentation

05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit is moe to tanf so
 
05:12:14.160 --> 05:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit is moe to tanf so
any

05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
reduction here in general funds would
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
mean we would just have to
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
increase general funds somewhere else to
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
the same is also true uh chris of 6170
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that tanf
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
moa um that that's medicaid moe
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay not hearing any questions so i'm
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that also sometimes moe
 
05:13:13.430 --> 05:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
all of the general funds in these
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
programs here
 
05:13:19.830 --> 05:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
are related to moe right karen
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
yes either medical medicaid or tanf yep
 
05:13:22.840 --> 05:13:25.190 align:start position:0%
yes either medical medicaid or tanf yep
yes

05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
the next one 6172 uh does refer back to
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
a question that came up earlier
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
about um budgeting for the refugee
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
grants here
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
we've budgeted based on what we've
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
experienced in 2020
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
not any potential anticipated increase
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
is that that must feel like the right
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
way to go for you
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
i i i i understand that the
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
new administration anticipates opening
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
up the refugee
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
pipeline a little bit more and it does
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
look like the source of funds is a
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
transfer from another agency so i'm not
 
05:14:11.840 --> 05:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
transfer from another agency so i'm not
sure

05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
if um there would potentially be
 
05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
additional funds that could be
 
05:14:18.708 --> 05:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
transferred for
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
in the first year or two the feds send a
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
of what the our refugee cost is supposed
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
is that is that true i don't know the
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
and i believe this area is specific for
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits that are under
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
um bureau family assistance but we can
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
get all that information for you
 
05:14:50.550 --> 05:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
um in a follow up for the committee
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
so my main thought on that is just uh to
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
double check your budgeting assumption
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
about changes in refugee volumes
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i need any information
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
back i just would like you to just
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
double check that
 
05:15:08.550 --> 05:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
you're you you think you're budgeting
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
properly and if
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if you got a different number for us
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
after thinking it through again you know
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
just come back
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right we will do that and um to
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
the earlier question about how does this
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
budget relate to
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the office of health equity that you
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
heard about earlier these
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
are actually transferred from the office
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
of health equity so these are
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:38.950 --> 05:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
which line was that oh
 
05:15:38.960 --> 05:15:41.430 align:start position:0%
which line was that oh
[Music]

05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's within the ocon budget
 
05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the accounting units
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head you know that
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking at right now one is the
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
6172 double od that's what you're
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes yeah these are coming over from an
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
so we will take a look at that and we'll
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
submit a change request if if we think
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay um and then we come down to
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
aptd grants um you will notice that
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 here
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
is higher than fiscal year 21.
 
05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
this budget the aptd budget was reduced
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
in the house phase
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
from the agency and governor budgets
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
for 20 and 21 they were reduced based on
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
caseload assumptions that the house had
 
05:16:44.550 --> 05:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
the case loads we experienced did not
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
drop as much as
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
um the house had anticipated so we
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
are budgeting those where we believe
 
05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
those case loads will be
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
this uh we did have to do transfers of
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
into this uh class line and i anticipate
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
we will have to do the same in fiscal
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
year 21 probably about a million dollars
 
05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
a million and a half dollars
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
so we are budgeting uh a slate reduction
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
from 20 um in
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
22 and 23. again these are areas as
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
chris spoke to
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
that as the unemployment benefits change
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
if the economy
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
continues to be down
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we will start to see increases in
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm getting a message from rebecca
 
05:17:38.550 --> 05:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we already moved 1.3 million in
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 at the last
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
or in one of the past few fiscal
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.840 --> 05:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
transfer

05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
6176 is state assistance montana
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
hold on just one second yeah so that
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
line you're just talking about
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
karen that's also moe money is that
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes this is moe to medicaid
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
so you have to spend it you have correct
 
05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
we have to operate this program under
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
medicaid so
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
if it's under budgeted we have to
 
05:18:20.550 --> 05:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
transfer funds we cannot say
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
oh we're shutting off the program we're
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
out of money we have to operate at
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
to receive the match in medicaid this is
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
direct cash assistance to individuals
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
that have disabilities
 
05:18:30.878 --> 05:18:42.110 align:start position:0%
that have disabilities
so

05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
you have a question keith you look like
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
sorry i had my mute on yeah i don't have
 
05:19:14.550 --> 05:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
the next one is uh 7148 which is
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
a community services block brand we call
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
did we go over that in the slide deck
 
05:19:28.550 --> 05:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
what what is that yep
 
05:19:30.550 --> 05:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
that is money that goes to the cap
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that was in the
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
um department over the division overview
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a hundred percent
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
pass-through money from the fed
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
from the federal government it's um
 
05:19:46.150 --> 05:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
to go and it's in legislation it goes to
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
there is a small amount of general funds
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
there as well sorry thousand dollars
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
which is most likely related to the
 
05:19:59.280 --> 05:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
which is most likely related to the
employee

05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
employee
 
05:20:04.230 --> 05:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
good thank you one employee
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit at the bottom of
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
this page is 80 25 which was workman's
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
workman's comp um that as i mentioned
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
we've moved to the ocom budget this is
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
one of those areas that i mentioned had
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
a smaller
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
budget and that we consolidated
 
05:20:23.200 --> 05:20:29.470 align:start position:0%
budget and that we consolidated
departmentwide

05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
rebecca what was the change in ssbg that
 
05:20:52.878 --> 05:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
rebecca what was the change in ssbg that
uh

05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:04.830 --> 05:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.840 --> 05:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
the nature of this program looks to have
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
shifted too right if you're going from
 
05:21:10.798 --> 05:21:11.670 align:start position:0%
shifted too right if you're going from
contracts

05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
to grants that's actually the change
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
from contracts to grants was what i
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
spoke about earlier
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
that um to better track the
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient contracts we've moved
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
those to class 74.
 
05:21:26.708 --> 05:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't necessarily mean that the
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
program's changed we're just trying to
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
track it better
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay so this um ssbg
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
came from dcyf and there was another
 
05:21:36.400 --> 05:21:36.868 align:start position:0%
came from dcyf and there was another
piece

05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
piece
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we used to fund the contracts
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the community our comprehensive
 
05:21:43.040 --> 05:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
for the community our comprehensive
family

05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
support services and the general fund
 
05:21:47.040 --> 05:21:47.430 align:start position:0%
support services and the general fund
piece

05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
piece
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
came from a different accounting unit
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
within bfa so we just kind of put them
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
all in one spot
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
so they're not new general funds they're
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:00.840 --> 05:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh 72-16 is the kinship grant
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
100 federal this again has that change
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
from 102
 
05:22:17.590 --> 05:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
to 74 for us to better track
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's really about the single audit the
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
audit that's done by kpmg
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
we did have a prioritized feed for this
 
05:22:31.120 --> 05:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
we did have a prioritized feed for this
one

05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's not really a grant though is it i
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
mean technically
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you're paying a pmg
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
no no i'm sorry i was saying that that's
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
why we moved it from 102 to 74 not to
 
05:22:46.548 --> 05:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
pay kpmg
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
to better track it for reporting
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
purposes when kpmg audits us
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry about that no that's right
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh so so is is it is it technically a
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
grant that
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
instead of a contract the the actual
 
05:23:02.558 --> 05:23:03.270 align:start position:0%
instead of a contract the the actual
vehicle

05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the the acquisition vehicle is changing
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
from contract to grant
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the grants program has a better
 
05:23:11.590 --> 05:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
tracking system
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
no so it it still would be a contract uh
 
05:23:18.070 --> 05:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
but 74 class line 74
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
allows us to put just the contracts that
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
are related to sub-recipient monitoring
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
which are more grant-like but we still
 
05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
use a contract vehicle with the
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
contracts unit
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
it means that they are providing
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
so so you know it better than i do but
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
if if you look at it later and you think
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a different word than grant
 
05:23:42.240 --> 05:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
there's a different word than grant
because

05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
i think contracts and grants have
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
different meanings
 
05:23:48.628 --> 05:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
i just i just want to keep all the
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
wording transparent
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the public to look at i totally
 
05:23:53.520 --> 05:23:54.150 align:start position:0%
for the public to look at i totally
understand

05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a round peg in a
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
square hole we
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
did request of department of
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
administrative services to create
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
a class line for us specific to track
 
05:24:03.680 --> 05:24:04.150 align:start position:0%
a class line for us specific to track
and

05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
they told us that we were not able to
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
add a class line so we had to select a
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
class line that was most applicable
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and then explain it so this is one of
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
those situations
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
so 74 was not a class sign that we
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
typically used
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
so this allowed us to use that for this
 
05:24:21.200 --> 05:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
so this allowed us to use that for this
purpose

05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any other questions
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
rebecca you did mention that there is a

bye um and what what was that
prioritized

05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
for i'm sorry it was
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the facilitating organization
 
05:25:36.548 --> 05:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
yeah sure that um is it provides um
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
support that we talked about earlier in
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
the um division overview
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
to assist um to increase um supports to
 
05:25:45.990 --> 05:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
the family resource centers
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
that provide primary prevention services
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
to families
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
and to really coordinate the services
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
that will focus on the prevention and
 
05:25:57.840 --> 05:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
that will focus on the prevention and
mitigation

05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
05:26:01.830 --> 05:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
of child abuse and neglect and
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and also
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
expand the kinship navigation program so
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
it can be offered statewide
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
with the increasing number of parents or
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
grandparents raising grandchildren
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
and family members um you know there's a
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
huge need for increased kinship support
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like that ought to be
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
coming from a domestic and sexual
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
violence account
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
um if you're talking about child abuse
 
05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't well it's to it's to provide
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
support services so that
 
05:26:43.270 --> 05:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
you're providing parenting education
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
through the family resource centers
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
um and home visiting services so that
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
parents can raise
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
bees stronger parents and reduce child
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and the incidence of it so
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
they don't have to become involved
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
with dcyf so it's a prevention
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay but it doesn't all right so i don't
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:27:10.230 --> 05:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
take this down a tangent but it seems
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
like the domestic and sexual violence
 
05:27:12.958 --> 05:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
like the domestic and sexual violence
accounts

05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
also pay for prevention but not for
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
um for children is not my understanding
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
but that was under domestic that
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
children are
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
included that child abuse or abuse
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
between a parent and a child
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
is part of that i'm gonna defer to karen
 
05:27:35.110 --> 05:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
and rebecca on that but that's not my
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
understanding and we don't
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
we get very in this division the only
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
funds we have
 
05:27:44.230 --> 05:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
um to assist um individuals who have
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence are for our shelter
 
05:27:46.320 --> 05:27:47.270 align:start position:0%
domestic violence are for our shelter
programs

05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:27:49.670 --> 05:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and to support some of the shelters
 
05:27:49.680 --> 05:27:51.190 align:start position:0%
um and to support some of the shelters
for

05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have anything to add it
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
it may be a question that you could ask
 
05:28:04.868 --> 05:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
to direct your ribsum when dcyf presents
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
as the domestic violence funds are
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
within his budget
 
05:28:09.360 --> 05:28:14.708 align:start position:0%
within his budget
okay

05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
will you still be here miss rounds oh
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
you got me the whole time
 
05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
you don't get to get rid of me okay very
 
05:28:22.400 --> 05:28:22.708 align:start position:0%
you don't get to get rid of me okay very
good

05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:28:27.548 --> 05:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
with me um all right so we're down to
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.840 --> 05:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
operations

05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
operations
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.718 --> 05:28:44.708 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:28:44.708 --> 05:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
yes this is where those 370 staff
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
live so i already talked about um
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a workload
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
benchmark and is this the one where you
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
said it's hard to do because
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
you guys do an integrated service
 
05:29:00.840 --> 05:29:02.230 align:start position:0%
you guys do an integrated service
approach

05:29:02.230 --> 05:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
approach
 
05:29:04.708 --> 05:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
but i will get you the best that we have
 
05:29:04.718 --> 05:29:05.350 align:start position:0%
but i will get you the best that we have
um

05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
i've seen this in a number of places
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
personal services permanent classified
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
second year they tend to have a i don't
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
know five to six percent
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
increase there is that just a
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
generalized wage increase
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
it would be the step increases that we
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
as a department we cannot edit those
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
numbers department of administrative
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
services provides the numbers so it has
 
05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
to be because of step
 
05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.360 --> 05:29:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.190 --> 05:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is 7214 which is
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
new heights
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
and as you heard about yesterday the
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
this is really the staff for new heights
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
the contracts for new heights with
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay budget the permanent there are the
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
positions are down there
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.840 --> 05:30:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
we have created another salaried
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
position is that what that is
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
it would have been moved from somewhere
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
else go ahead rebecca
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
oh the two um unclassifieds were moved
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
into the bfa
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
the 6125 budget
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we saw before
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the people still be working on new
 
05:30:58.628 --> 05:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
futures or or new heights rather
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah they're in the director's office
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.350 --> 05:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
what was the basic justification for the
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
one fte increase do you know
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
do you know where the one classified
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
employee increase came from
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
or the one increase in employees correct
 
05:31:24.958 --> 05:31:25.590 align:start position:0%
or the one increase in employees correct
not

05:31:25.590 --> 05:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
it was an overall it's um actually so we
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
have one position that is an
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
eight t that we're converting to a
 
05:31:35.270 --> 05:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent position
 
05:31:38.708 --> 05:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
and that's where that one comes from
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:49.270 --> 05:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
rebecca i do have a question about that
 
05:31:51.670 --> 05:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
later we can connect
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
um 7997 is i believe the last one
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
in this bureau which is the disability
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
so this looks like a pretty big jump in
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
if we if we eliminate what looks to be a
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.850 --> 05:32:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.860 --> 05:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
it is a reduction from the from the
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's more just bringing the
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
budget in line with actuals
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
so the budget fiscal year 21 adjusted
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
authorized was 2.8 million
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we have it down to 2.3 which is more
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
in line with where the actuals were in
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
it looks like the consultant budget is
 
05:32:59.440 --> 05:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
it looks like the consultant budget is
um

05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
significantly less yeah we actually
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
moved we had
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
a contract with umass and then we had
 
05:33:07.280 --> 05:33:08.150 align:start position:0%
a contract with umass and then we had
independent

05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
um medical consultant contracts and we
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay then i think that concludes it does
 
05:33:29.350 --> 05:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
the accounting units for
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
the fa yep 7997
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
hey it's a great job thank you thank you
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
so much
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
chris i hope you recover
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%

05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%

and we will get back to you once we hear

05:33:55.920 --> 05:33:56.470 align:start position:0%
okay so before we say goodbye does
anyone

05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
have anything for the good of the
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee that they want to say
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
about now i i have just one uh first
 
05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chris rebecca
 
05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
mary all the bureau chiefs that were on
 
05:34:07.590 --> 05:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the background i appreciate it
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
i also wondered if you would discuss
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
when tuesday might be moved to today so
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
that i can let the directors know
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
um scheduling is always difficult with
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
directors so i just want to make sure
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
talking about march 2nd right
 
05:34:22.708 --> 05:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
yes as much notice as possible yeah i
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if mr ripples had a
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
chance to think through it but i haven't
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk to him yet i just
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
know we need to get it off with a second
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if the committee members
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh would consider next friday a
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
i'm reluctant to reschedule it to a day
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
when you already have other things
 
05:34:44.480 --> 05:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
when you already have other things
scheduled

05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
05:34:48.150 --> 05:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
because they have been no it should be
 
05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
its own day
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
dcyf's a big one so um
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
i i i i'm not looking at a calendar
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
so you think march 5th is a
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have a lot of joint
 
05:35:04.948 --> 05:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
fiscal committees on fridays
 
05:35:07.110 --> 05:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
is that a is that a conflict that you
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
know there's not a fiscal committee
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
on the ship now okay
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
um so uh representative norgren it
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
looked like you wanted to say something
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
no i think that looks clear for other
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
house businesses
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that would be fine okay
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then representative rogers did you
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
i know representative weiler does
 
05:35:36.310 --> 05:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler did you want to
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
say something sir
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have anything scheduled for friday
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
you don't have anything scheduled for
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
this friday although i think hhs has
 
05:35:51.910 --> 05:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
some prior commitments that
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
they have to be i like county meeting on
 
05:35:54.400 --> 05:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
they have to be i like county meeting on
friday

05:35:56.470 --> 05:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
friday
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
and i'll give a meeting friday as well
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
on this coming monday you do actually
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
have a division three meeting
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we're trying to get off of tuesday
 
05:36:09.040 --> 05:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
yeah we're trying to get off of tuesday
right

05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
so that's like substituting substituting
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
friday for tuesday might
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with that sir that
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
seems to be a consensus building
 
05:36:25.590 --> 05:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
john the fifth yes yeah sure yeah that's
 
05:36:25.600 --> 05:36:26.788 align:start position:0%
john the fifth yes yeah sure yeah that's
good

05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
and i think karen did you karen did you
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to start at 10 30 instead of 9 30.
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
i would request that i do i'm the uh
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
department's um designee to the
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement advisory commission um
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
that senator rosenwald set up for that
 
05:36:44.080 --> 05:36:44.868 align:start position:0%
that senator rosenwald set up for that
friday

05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
friday
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
um that starts at nine o'clock so i i
 
05:36:48.628 --> 05:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
think that i could leave that meeting by
 
05:36:49.750 --> 05:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
10 30
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
um and be able to to be over with with
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
you all if that works
 
05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
i would be very appreciative okay so
 
05:36:57.200 --> 05:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
i would be very appreciative okay so
just

05:36:57.670 --> 05:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
just to confirm we're only doing dcyf
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
because there were there was like a a
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
two-parter on the
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
on tuesday wasn't there we were going to
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
finish this one off and then hit dcyf
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
we did have uh the division of
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral health as a two-parter on
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
monday and tuesday
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
so the plan was to start off on monday
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire hospital and
 
05:37:21.360 --> 05:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire hospital and
glencliff

05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
glencliff
 
05:37:23.990 --> 05:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and also the division of behavioral
 
05:37:25.910 --> 05:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
health karen do you think we could get
 
05:37:25.920 --> 05:37:26.230 align:start position:0%
health karen do you think we could get
through

05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
all of those in one day i think the
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
potential exists we probably
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
um i i would say that to get through
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
both of those and one day we probably
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
would need to work past
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
four o'clock would be my guess but we
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
probably could
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
get them done in one day can we do any
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
of them friday morning
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
just to put a big dent in it or to
 
05:37:48.150 --> 05:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
separate them like
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
i've never gone over the new hampshire
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
hospital or glencliff
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
is that are those
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
really long not typically new hampshire
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
hospital and glencliff both have quite a
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
few accounting units
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the purpose is all the same right
 
05:38:06.150 --> 05:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's all operating the facility so there
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
the questions are typically less on
 
05:38:09.750 --> 05:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
those accounting units
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but i think that if we started at 10
 
05:38:14.548 --> 05:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
30 on friday
 
05:38:16.070 --> 05:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
if we need to wrap up anything
 
05:38:17.590 --> 05:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health it probably wouldn't
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
take more than an hour
 
05:38:21.030 --> 05:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then we would have the rest of the
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
day for dcyf
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
just to give you a heads up jess on
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
monday afternoon i won't be there for a
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
few hours at a doctor's appointment
 
05:38:31.590 --> 05:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
you also have talking about i'm going
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
for 38.
 
05:38:35.670 --> 05:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
pardon me which monday are we talking
 
05:38:35.680 --> 05:38:36.708 align:start position:0%
pardon me which monday are we talking
about

05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
first off monday the we're talking about
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
monday the
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
first because we're trying to uh
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh eliminate the second and the second
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
had a couple of things going on all
 
05:38:49.600 --> 05:38:50.070 align:start position:0%
