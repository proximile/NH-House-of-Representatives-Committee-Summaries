00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and then charter
 
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
school lease aid and then our last topic
 
00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 align:start position:0%

charter school funding
 
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
hello so again
 
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
amy clark for the department of
 
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
education you're also safe and facility
 
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.830 align:start position:0%
education you're also safe and facility
management

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
um see that
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
we'll all be able to see that on your
 
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.510 align:start position:0%
we'll all be able to see that on your
screen

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so the public school
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
um this is in your handout this is
 
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat um short but i have a summary
 
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.710 align:start position:0%
somewhat um short but i have a summary
page

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
and a list of all the project reports
 
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so of the 42 pages you'll be happy
 
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
to know that
 
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
about 40 pages of it are the awards uh
 
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
and to talk a little bit about public
 
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure college
 
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh so again there's my contact
 
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
uh so again there's my contact
information

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to know more about it uh the
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
law is under
 
00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
and essentially the public school
 
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund in a nutshell
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
was established in 2017 the fund had a
 
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
total amount
 
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
of 28 million dollars available to
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
public schools which also includes
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools because of course
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools are public schools
 
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh and it reimbursed uh
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
schools for the following three types of
 
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.750 align:start position:0%
schools for the following three types of
projects

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
um e-rate state match which is
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
essentially a federal program
 
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
that needed a state um
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
a matching um percent from the state so
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
this fund provided that match
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
and e-rate projects are simply to bring
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
fiber connection to schools so that
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
construction of the
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
fiber connection to the schools and that
 
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.190 align:start position:0%
fiber connection to the schools and that
was

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
type one type two was addressing
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
life safety uh deficiencies
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
at schools and then the third type was
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
improving security in schools
 
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
and just want to clarify because i think
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of times people get confused
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
between life safety and security when we
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
life safety think about the fire
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
marshal's office
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
think about like buildings being
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
condemned because
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
of um certain fire traps or
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
um things going on um that would be
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
hazardous to somebody's health
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
or um somebody being in danger
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the building itself security you can
 
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
think of that's the police department
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
that though the police department will
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
be happy that you're putting in since
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
improving security at your school so
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
security projects are
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
hardening schools in this particular
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
case pardoning schools
 
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
with door locks uh followers in front of
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh vestibules security cameras and
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
so those are the three categories
 
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
um the status of the public school
 
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
um fund is that all of the awards have
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
been awarded and all the money has been
 
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.190 align:start position:0%
been awarded and all the money has been
claimed

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
claimed
 
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
so um the public school infrastructure
 
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
so um the public school infrastructure
fund

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
closed the awards um were final on
 
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.229 align:start position:0%
closed the awards um were final on
december

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
of 2020 so from 2017 to december of 2020
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
all the awards went out and all the
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
awards were claimed and there's no new
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
applications because there's no new
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
two members of the house two members of
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
the director of homeland security and
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
emergency management
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education the chair
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the school building authority
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the state board of
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
education so they formed a commission
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the governor um and
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
they awarded uh
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
awards to schools to perform one of
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
these three category types
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and in general of those three
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
categories the reimbursement rates were
 
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.469 align:start position:0%
categories the reimbursement rates were
10

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
for the e-rate state match because
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's what was required by the federal
 
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
that's what was required by the federal
government

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the state give a 10 match so that's
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
what the fund gave for the e-rate
 
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.150 align:start position:0%
what the fund gave for the e-rate
projects

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the life safety projects that
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
depended on their building age rate
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
the commission decided that they would
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
grant out the building aid rate for
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
those projects which
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
was between 30 and 60 like we talked
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
about already
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and then for security projects it was
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
just a flat rate
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
um the commission chose a flat rate of
 
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.990 align:start position:0%
um the commission chose a flat rate of
80

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
80
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
oh i think i can make that bigger um
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
here's a summary of those awards
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
you approved 31 million dollars almost
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
32 million dollars of awards
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you're like hmm that's weird i
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
thought you only got 28 million
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
well that is true but some people
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
um returned their award because they
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
were not able to either get the local
 
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
were not able to either get the local
match

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
or they just withdrew their awards and
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
other people bought an award let's say
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
for 50
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
000 and they only spent 48 so i was able
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
to take that extra money
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
and put it back in the bucket and then
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
re-award that money
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that is slightly more um than what
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
the fund was
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
because money was returned for those
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
approved grants
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
for all three categories was about 32
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
we paid 27 million dollars and
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
there was about four and a half million
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
dollars that one spent
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
um you can see there's a breakout
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
of if you're curious is to see like
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
where did this money go
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
e-rate you can see with a very very
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
small amount
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of the e-rate projects were approved
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
put in a request there were just not
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
that many requests
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
um let's skip over and prove security
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
for a minute we could see life safety
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
um we paid out about three million
 
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.550 align:start position:0%
um we paid out about three million
dollars

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
on life safety projects and if you're
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
thinking that doesn't also sound like
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
very much money um because it's only
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
10 of what was uh put out roughly
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
um well that's because life safety
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
projects in the law
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to be very specific life safety
 
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.029 align:start position:0%
have to be very specific life safety
projects

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
um the law requires that they be under
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
imminent danger
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
or substantial risk and those of those
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
definitions are actually
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
defined by the state fire marshal's
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
office and
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
you can tell that this is a situation in
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
a school where
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
these are pretty significant issues um
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
some of the some of those projects were
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
um to bring wooden structures up with
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
a sprinkler system um some of those were
 
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
a sprinkler system um some of those were
like

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
installation of fire panels these were
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
like direct violations of the code
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that helped correct those problems
 
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
and that helped correct those problems
but

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
the main story of the public school
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
um is really that the public
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
really went to improve the security at
 
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.309 align:start position:0%
really went to improve the security at
schools

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
and you could see 24 of the um 27
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
million went out to
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
schools that um to
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
to harden and harden their schools for
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
improving the security of the students
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
cameras doors locks security glass
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
vest of your check-in windows things
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
and all schools that
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
wanted funds which were almost everybody
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
um was able to receive at least one
 
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.230 align:start position:0%
um was able to receive at least one
award

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
award
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
the clinician did a really good job of
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
reaching out to all the schools
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
they went through and and awarded money
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then they said oh let's let's hold
 
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
and then they said oh let's let's hold
up

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
let's before we give you your third or
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
fourth award
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
let's check with all of those other
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
districts that maybe they haven't had
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
time to apply yet
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the commission worked really hard to
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
get everybody an opportunity that wanted
 
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
get everybody an opportunity that wanted
to

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i'd say 90 i don't know that's never
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
exact but i'm just going to say about 95
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
98 of the school districts received some
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
kind of award
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of schools that um
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
that did not
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
apply but most part um all our schools
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
received awards of some amount
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so there's that if you're wondering
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
well how many people applied
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
here's a summary of those applications
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
um a summary of how many were approved
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
not fruit there is a wait list so
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
there is a wait list of applications we
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
have run out of money
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
there are 59 applicants left on the wait
 
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.750 align:start position:0%
there are 59 applicants left on the wait
list

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
um totally about 1.2 million dollars
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
worth of frameworks
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the commission um this was a first
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
in first come first serve however
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
if you had not received an award yet you
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
got to jump the line in front of anybody
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
that already received an award
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
so the 59 applicants
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
on that waitlist have already received
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
five awards that doesn't mean they don't
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
want more you don't want to apply
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
that but um there's not 59 schools
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
that does not represent 59 schools they
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get securing money
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
um security money was um granted to all
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
schools that employed
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a break out by the category
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
now if you wanted to see i won't go
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
through the next 40 pages
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
so did the did the public school
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure committee
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
meet to um give out
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
any of this 1.2 million
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
or is that going to lapse back into the
 
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.310 align:start position:0%
or is that going to lapse back into the
education

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
or someplace yeah those have been
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the sense that if more money was
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
appropriated the commission has already
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
and the governor has already um said
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
that those are uh
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
projects that are on the waitlist but
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is no more money to homework
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay so didn't i see some place
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh you've got 1.2
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
to be returned to the um
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
general fund yeah um and that is because
 
00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.949 align:start position:0%
general fund yeah um and that is because
um

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
those projects so when we got money back
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
we issued so i get money back from
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
schools then i issues the next person on
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
the waitlist money
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
however when december 30th closed
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
that's all the money that came in in the
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
last month and i have no time
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
to then reissue another award in
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
december because
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
the fund closed december 20th
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
december 2020. so yes i have extra money
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
but i have no way of
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
awarding it because it just came in
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
december and the award expires in
 
00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:17.509 align:start position:0%
december and the award expires in
december

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay so basically this 1.2
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh is going to lapse to the general fund
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the end of this fiscal year
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
correct and you can see these just
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
happen to be
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers 1.237
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
will be returned and the amount on the
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
wait list is one point two three six
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh it just they're very close numbers
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
that money will last and those people
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
will remain at the waitlist
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
um because the awards had uh officially
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
not technically but the award expired in
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
december 2020 and that will be collapsed
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
back into the
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
general fund okay thank you very much
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have a
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
amy is there an action that we could
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
possibly take to get those funds
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
released so that those school districts
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
could get
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from those
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh the law i think you'd be uh
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
in rsa 198 15y there is
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
a um there is a deadline
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
for those awards um
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think the commission
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
could meet
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
and decide there just isn't enough time
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
so um then
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the project's gonna have to go to
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal and then go to gnc
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
and then the the school districts would
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
have to come up with their local chair
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
sorry representative murray
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think maybe mary sort of answered
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
would and you know being relatively new
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
would these projects be appropriate in
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
hb2 is this something we could put in
 
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
hb2 is this something we could put in
hb2

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the specific projects that have been
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
approved but i think
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i heard amy say that the
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
school districts would still have more
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
work to do so that apparently wouldn't
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
is that right well i can say that there
 
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:23.750 align:start position:0%
is that right well i can say that there
is

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 2 i believe
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's proposed
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
to extend the public school
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and put additional
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
money in
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
in there and so if that happens then i
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
imagine the commission could
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
decide uh whether to release these funds
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
and keep these people going but the
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
current law is what kept what
 
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:49.030 align:start position:0%
current law is what kept what
um

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah so the whole reason
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
why we actually
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
telling you guys about the public school
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure today um is not just
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
because we want you to be aware of
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the past
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
but because the governor's office did
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually put 30 million dollars 15
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars in each year and
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
22 and 15 million dollars and 23
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
into the public school infrastructure
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
fund so had that not happened we
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually probably wouldn't be including
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
this information in our presentation
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
but we felt that it was important that
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
you know about the fund and you know
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is potentially something that may
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
be funded going forward and you
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
you will need to as a commission make it
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
or a committee rather make a decision on
 
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
or a committee rather make a decision on
that

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
with that said the public school
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund has since
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
been amended after all the awards were
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit different written
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
last year it was um uh amended the law
 
00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:37.749 align:start position:0%
last year it was um uh amended the law
was

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so now i think that there's um
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
eligibility for
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
hvac systems or in our systems that
 
00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
hvac systems or in our systems that
improve

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
improve
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
air quality that is in the public school
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently but by the time that was added
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
all the awards had already been uh
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
allocated out
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
and follow up yes please go ahead
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
um given the covet is there federal
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
money that can is
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
that might be coming in or to be used
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
for some of these projects
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
or uh not not the projects that are that
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the commission currently looked at
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
because it did not include hvac
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
systems but if uh um but
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
to answer your question yes federal
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
money you can currently use esser funds
 
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
money you can currently use esser funds
for

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
anything cobit related which is air
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
quality certainly
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
in hvac systems uh
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
try not to maybe i i'm just gonna say
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
this um keep in mind
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
that you can't you can't just take an a
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
track system and put it into an old
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
building and expect that it's going to
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
run efficiently
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
and work the way uh any nhv system
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
is designed to work for new buildings
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
conversation

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else amy uh and
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
then lastly on the public school
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund it's just a list
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see that all the rest of the
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
remaining pages are if you want to see
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
what your district received
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
um or any district received you can see
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
this is actually the status of
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
every award and so even though most of
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
these stay
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
paid in here um you will see some
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
um not many but you'll see some that
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
went unclaimed
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
in other words uh some like here was one
 
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
in other words uh some like here was one
that's

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
withdrawn um so for some reason they
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
withdrew it
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you can scroll through and see the
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
status but
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
and then it has that grant category
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
remember i told you there were three
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
grant categories
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of them are going to
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
say improved security and then if you're
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
interested to see oh how much do they
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:56.549 align:start position:0%
interested to see oh how much do they
unders

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
unders
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know some of this money went back to
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
this one came 619 underfunded
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
on you know they spent 619 less
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
so that money went back into the public
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund to be
 
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund to be
reawarded

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
reawarded
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it is amazing how these little when
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 30 million dollars
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
these little guys add up so um i was
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised we had a
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
five million dollar or four million
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
dollar wait list
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
and if we were able to fund almost
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
everybody on the waitlist
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that's it for the public school
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund unless you have
 
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund unless you have
questions

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
i would uh i would just like to say that
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
i did sit on that
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
commission and um
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
i think that we did a very good job
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
in allocating the money and
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that amy makes it look
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
easy here
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh it was it was not easy we had
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
if you think we got a lot of paperwork
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
on hb2
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
or all of this stuff we got about the
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
same amount on the public
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure committee but it did a
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
lot of good things
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
for the state and hopefully we'll be
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh put some money into it uh this year
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
so uh representative heath you have a
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
question i just wanna
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair i just wanna concur with

because you made such an effort to spend
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
every single penny
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
you recalculate you do everything so
 
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.230 align:start position:0%
you recalculate you do everything so
efficiently

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
so uh just to echo what our chair said
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome thank
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
you and the schools would reiterate that
 
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
you and the schools would reiterate that
too

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
about for you all for those that were on
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
commission the schools have reported
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
that you know essentially they applied
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then they sent the money and got
 
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
and then they sent the money and got
reimbursement

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know they they said they were gonna
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
buy cameras and they went about cameras
 
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
buy cameras and they went about cameras
and

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
and uh it was a relatively uh painless
 
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
and uh it was a relatively uh painless
process

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
for them they're not always used to that
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
from especially from my office so that's
 
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.710 align:start position:0%
from especially from my office so that's
good

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
so i think next up unless you have more
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the public school
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
no thank you very much and uh caitlyn
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
well you're you're not quite done with
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
amy yet we have one more topic for amy
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
to present which is
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
age of chartered public schools so i'm
 
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
age of chartered public schools so i'm
sorry

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me no that's that's okay um
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
and so the final program here uh that is
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
out of my office
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
is the lease the charter school weekday
 
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
is the lease the charter school weekday
program

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh and can you see this all you can see
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
this it says lease 8 at the top
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay i never know if it switches when i
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
search so i'm glad
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
so um this is only three pages and
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh program summary and then the payments
 
00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.430 align:start position:0%
uh program summary and then the payments
itself

00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
again there's my contact information if
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
you need me
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
um and for lisa um
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
that is under rsa 198 15 hh
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
and there are these day rules under 83
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
323 um least aid
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
is simply grant money to
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
assist public charter schools and
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
meeting the cost of their
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
annual lease payment and
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
these aid grants um the law
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
says that um that these aid covers
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
thirty percent
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
of their annual lease a payment up to
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars for school
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i'd say a little more than half of
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
that full 30 percent covers their full
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
vca payment they don't get cash but then
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
probably the other uh 40 of schools
 
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
probably the other uh 40 of schools
maybe

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
um are actually subject to the cat they
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
get what
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
um per year
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
um just keep in mind charter schools
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
that own
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
their own buildings are not eligible for
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
these aid it is specific
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to uh unlease agreement
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
before uh the funding source is the
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the history of the save is really
 
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
and the history of the save is really
that

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
lease date was created in in law in 2003
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't funded for the first time
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
until uh this little
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
20 20 pistol 20.
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so we've only had two appropriations
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 and fiscal 21 the first year
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
was 200 000
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
and when i went when we went to pay the
 
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.630 align:start position:0%
and when i went when we went to pay the
30

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
of those payments with a cap of 30 000
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't need those payments
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
so all the schools were prorated down to
 
00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
so all the schools were prorated down to
44

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
44
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
so you can see that was a significant
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in payment
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal 21 so this data for
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
reprocreation was
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
500 000 uh and so i
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
was able to make fully aid payments
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
using that cap of thirty thousand
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the thirty percent total of my
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
we say payment of three hundred and
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
eighty two thousand dollars
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
so again the difference between these
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
will also go back
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
and if you're curious to see what those
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
payments were
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
um i will make this bigger but
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's the whole sheet it's all one
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
sheet um and you can see
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
the charter school name is here and this
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
is broken up into fiscal 20 and fiscal
 
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
is broken up into fiscal 20 and fiscal
21.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is the eligible amount this is the
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
grant amount that had i had enough
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation i would have been able to
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
grant them
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then this is how much they were
 
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
and then this is how much they were
prorated

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
prorated
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so you can see thirty thousand
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
dollars they were going to be paid 30
 
00:23:59.600 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
dollars they were going to be paid 30
000

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
but their appropriation wasn't enough so
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
they were prorated down to 13 000.
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
you'll see this is a common number
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
because this is 44
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
of 30 000 and you see it down here
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that's half ended up at that 13
 
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
anybody that's half ended up at that 13
000

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
mark um so the total um
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
the total grant amount for 2020
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
um festival 21 the eligible fees amount
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
and then their grant amount i had enough
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
so they were not prorated i did not have
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
to provide schools
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then um i included some people have
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
asked like oh what about that school or
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
what about that school
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
um and and here's the reasons
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
this year in fiscal 21 i went back and
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
asked schools why didn't you apply
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's because they don't have a
 
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.269 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's because they don't have a
lease

00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
you can see that some of these should
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
say no no these in some schools did not
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
apply for me
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have for lisa unless
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
so uh amy the in the budget this year
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
i think was 500 000
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
again for 22 and 23.
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
and you indicated that it looked like
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh 385
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
would cover the leases
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh obvious that
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
does not include any new charter schools
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
come online uh
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
for this year and is there more than one
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
that has come online this year
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
well i'll answer that question for amy
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so there are
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
two new charter schools that we are
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
expecting to open this fall
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so those two would obviously be
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
eligible for lease date and they're not
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
included here
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
additionally all of these schools that
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
you see on this list in front of you
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
that do not apply may actually apply
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
next year they didn't apply for whatever
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
various reasons a couple of them
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
had a couple issues obtaining some of
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
the documentation
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
other ones just couldn't apply by the
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate deadline and whatnot
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
so the 382 is the amount that was a
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
that applied and was approved this year
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
but 500 000
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
may not end up fully funding everybody
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
um including the two new schools and the
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
existing schools if everybody does
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
choose to apply
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
and also keep in mind there is uh
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't have the house
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill number in front of me but that
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
there is a house bill out there that
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
increases the cap
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
from 30 000 to 50 thousand
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that that small change would already
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
put it over
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand if that if that
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
cap existed in fiscal 21
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
this total would have been like 520 000
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
or something like
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you very much uh
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative heath your vienna yes
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
um the there's been a federal award of
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
quite a large
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
sum of money um can any of that money be
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.750 align:start position:0%
sum of money um can any of that money be
used

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
for uh rent purposes so
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of working through
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
the what is and is not allowable in the
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
federal grant with the us department of
 
00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
federal grant with the us department of
education

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
however under the last charter school
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
grant that we received
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
we were allowed to reimburse schools
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
for three months prior to opening for a
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
portion of
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
lease expenses so it was only for the
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
three months prior to opening after they
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
opened they are not received
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
their ll's refer anything we don't know
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
if those same
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirements or allowabilities are under
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
this grant or not yet
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't received that documentation
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the feds
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
all right thank you which makes sense if
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's a startup if it's a startup grant
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
which is probably why it would cover on
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
some of the first few months at the
 
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.310 align:start position:0%
some of the first few months at the
least

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
okay that is it unless you have some
 
00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
okay that is it unless you have some
questions

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
no i don't want to cut you off but
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and you've done a
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
great job as always
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay caitlin it's now your turn i think
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
so um yes but this year i've actually
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
firmed up my presentation
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
um so this year we are very lucky to
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
have mark miganello on staff here at
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
um and he is going to be taking
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
everything that he learned with helping
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
division two with the last biennium
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
budget and everything he learned
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
learned with working with mickey um and
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
trying to give his best shot at the
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy presentation i'll be here
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
um if he needs any assistance or if
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's any questions but i think mark
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
has really got it
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
oh can you hear me can you see my screen
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
we can hear you now um
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the record mark manganello with the
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
department of education uh you received
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
a 46-page pdf
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
um try to go through it quickly try to
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh touch upon the key points here
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's a table of contents to
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
reference back to those documents
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a summary and if you worked
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
with me with my legislative email this
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
is my doe
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
email now a couple of things to point
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
out in state fiscal year 2020
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten was added into the
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
state adequacy aid formula
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
so prior to that um it was only half day
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so it was
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
bumped up to full day and moved into
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
adequacy there was a program
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
prior to 2020 called kino garden but
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
that program was replaced by just
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
putting full day kindergarten in
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.230 align:start position:0%
putting full day kindergarten in
adequacy

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
also in 2020 stabilization grants were
 
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:01.770 align:start position:0%
restored to the
 
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.029 align:start position:0%
restored to the
[Music]

00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
2012 level and so stabilization grants
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
are changes to the formula made in 2011
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
that negatively impacted the revenue
 
00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
that negatively impacted the revenue
towns

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
schools received from the state in 2012.
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
if due to changes in the formula you
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
lost state funding for your school
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
you received a stabilization grant and
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
then in 2017
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
changes in the law made it so that those
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
grants would phase out over a 25-year
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
period and they would phase out by
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
four percent reduction each year over 25
 
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.269 align:start position:0%
four percent reduction each year over 25
years

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
so in 2020 those reductions stopped and
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
those grants were restored to 100
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the 2012 level um and those changes
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
exist in current law today
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
so they exist in 2021 and they will
 
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
so they exist in 2021 and they will
exist

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
under current law in 2022 um another
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
change in 2021 that you've probably
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
heard about is the one-time aid
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
so that was 60 million dollars it was
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
added to the adequacy aid formula
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
in 2021 but it also expires in 2021 so
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's one time eight it's a one-time
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
addition to the formula but is set to
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
expire at the end of this year so will
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
not be available in 2022
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
under current law um other things to
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
note and the commissioner talked a lot
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
is the fnr issue with the usda waiving
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the documentation
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that families complete
 
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.430 align:start position:0%
requirements that families complete
those

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
complete those applications in order to
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
be eligible for free and reduced-priced
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
meals they're just eligible
 
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.789 align:start position:0%
meals they're just eligible
automatically

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's great for those families but
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
at the same time it creates
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
data issues for the department because
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
we use that documentation to calculate
 
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
we use that documentation to calculate
adequacy

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
and uh the commissioner talked about
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
communities are trying their best to get
 
00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:40.230 align:start position:0%
communities are trying their best to get
those

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
those applications in but it's still a
 
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.350 align:start position:0%
those applications in but it's still a
challenge

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
and so that's an issue going on because
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
and then um when you look at enrollment
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
numbers in this stock in this
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
46-page pdf you'll see some enrollment
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
data um
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment data historically declines at
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
around one percent ish
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
um each year but this year a four
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
percent decline
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
so um some families are leaving the
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
public school system
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and we're seeing that reflected in
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this is uh caitlin introduced this
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
document this just shows school
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
this document is produced by the lba so
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
mickey published this in
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
january 2020 i think so
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
and this just explains the adequacy aid
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
formula for
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
charter schools so with charter schools
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
you have uh
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
the regular cost of inadequate at cost
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education components
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
so you have base aid which is eight
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
seven hundred eight dollars
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
and seventy eight cents uh times the
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
number of pupils you have
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
and then you have a few differentiated
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
aid categories so for each
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
eligible um people eligible for
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price meal they receive
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
eighteen hundred dollars and fifty four
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
cent uh
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh one thousand eight hundred fifty four
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and thirty eight cents
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh per each pupil eligible so that's the
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
formula that's being impacted by the
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic because of those waivers
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh the number of pupils is decline is a
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot lower than we would expect
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so that's impacting the cost of an
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education which determines your
 
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.909 align:start position:0%
adequate education which determines your
aid

00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
and then there's also english language
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
learners um
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
for each english language learner you
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
have you get an a 725
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
and this is for a state fiscal year um
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2021
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then for each um each people
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services you
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
receive 1995
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
and 21 cents and then for each
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
third grade third grader who below
 
00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:43.269 align:start position:0%
third grade third grader who below
scored

00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
scored
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
below proficiency on the third grade
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
reading test and is not in any one of
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
these categories
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
the school would receive dollars and
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
725.63 cents for each one of those
 
00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:53.830 align:start position:0%
725.63 cents for each one of those
peoples

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
peoples
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
so that's the adequacy formula uh but
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
explaining charter schools and charter
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
schools receive an additional grant per
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.750 align:start position:0%
schools receive an additional grant per
pupil

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
of 3479.22
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
and that would result in your total
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
charter school age
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's a updated document
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
mickey produced recently
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
the lba produced and it just has cpi
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments so no changes have been made
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
to this formula
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
between these two bienniums at the
 
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.909 align:start position:0%
between these two bienniums at the
moment

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
except for the cpi adjustments are
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
reflected here so
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair um what is the
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
total figure then
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
so the total charter figure is 3479
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
plus the base adequacy um
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
so the the charter school figure oh so
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
um you're you're you're gonna get a base
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
oh so yeah you
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
for per pupil you would get um whatever
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the number is the 3708
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
plus that but then if you have students
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um qualifying for these eligibilities
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
you could potentially be eligible for
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
those amounts as well
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
so it was just ma'am chimi mayor please
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly um so they get all the
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
add-ons um but they have that uh
 
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
add-ons um but they have that uh
straight

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
base of 3470 plus
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy plus the add-ons
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you um and madam
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
chair if i could ask one more question
 
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.829 align:start position:0%
chair if i could ask one more question
please

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
certainly um this question is in
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
relation to the one-time
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
60 million dollar funding based on
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
disparity aid
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
can you tell me did every district in
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state get that or just those with
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
a high percentage of freedom reduced
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
lunch students
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
yep so that's a good question um that
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
aid was targeted
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
so if you had um the fiscal capacity
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
disparity aid was based on your
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
so if you look at your equalized
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
valuation of your property and you
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
divide it by the pupils
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
you get a evpp an equalized valuation
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
and any any community that had an
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
under a million dollars was eligible for
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
so some communities have really high
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
per pupil and some have really low so
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
not every not every school
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
qualified for that grant and then the
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
the other component of the 60 million is
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
the additional aid based on free and
 
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.349 align:start position:0%
the additional aid based on free and
reduced

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh price meal uh population percentage
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that one you were eligible if you had
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
your percentage of fnr eligible students
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
was greater than 12
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
of your total school population um then
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
you were eligible for that grant and
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
those grants were sliding scales so
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
those numbers vary depending on where
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
you are in that metric representative
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
heath we actually have
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
further down in the packet um the entire
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
2021 town by town
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
amounts so you'll be able to see exactly
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
which towns did and didn't receive a
 
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:52.870 align:start position:0%
which towns did and didn't receive a
grant

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then we also put together a document
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
per representative
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
berger's request that shows all one-time
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
aid that was received in fiscal year 21
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
to date
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
which actually includes the esser cares
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
money and the one-time adequacy funding
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
so those are later on in the packet and
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
we will get to those as well perfect so
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
yep so that was um this is the
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
describes the charter school calculation
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
for the current biennium we're going
 
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.550 align:start position:0%
for the current biennium we're going
into

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
this document is um just sort of a
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
breakdown by charter school of the
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended charter school
 
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended charter school
aid

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
for 2022 and 2023 um
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
just kind of we've already noted this
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's two new schools expected to go
 
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
there's two new schools expected to go
live

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
in this next biennium and these are you
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
know estimated enrollments
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
um for those um those schools
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
and then you can this should link up to
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
the what you see in your budget
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
budget package so uh this is only the
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh pupil aid not not
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the um lease aid correct this is just
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
the charter school like charter school
 
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.150 align:start position:0%
the charter school like charter school
adequacy

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
this next document um it kind of
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
describes uh charter's charter school
 
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.630 align:start position:0%
describes uh charter's charter school
adequacy

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the way you might be similar to
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
seeing district public school adequacy
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
in this more
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
horizontal format so this just walks you
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
through 2020 and what that looked like
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
and you can
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
see the how the charter school moves
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
this next document is uh 2007 to 2000
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh 2007 to 2021
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
charter school average daily membership
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
in attendance and we have the new
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
schools on here they're showing blanks
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
for 2021 because they're not going to
 
00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:41.829 align:start position:0%
for 2021 because they're not going to
open

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
by june 30th and some close charter
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
schools and you can
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of see the history of charter
 
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
kind of see the history of charter
school

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is the district public school
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
formula which is different there's some
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
similarities with the charter school aid
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
formula but
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit different so just like
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
charter schools receive adequacy
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
district public schools as well so the
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
same formula
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
generally applies there for the cost of
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate education
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
the difference is um something called uh
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
swept the statewide education property
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
tax so
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
the state applies a statewide property
 
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:23.109 align:start position:0%
the state applies a statewide property
tax

00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
known as swept and and what it does is
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
it the state needs to raise 363 million
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
dollars for the swept
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and what it will apply at tax across all
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
the properties in the state
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it's about around two dollars per
 
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
and it's about around two dollars per
thousand

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the statewide education
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
property tax and that money is raised
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
locally and it's retained locally so it
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
never makes its way to the state
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's um kept by the locals and so
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
when you run the adequacy calculation
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
you do the base a you do the
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
differential aid
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
you determine this amount which is the
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
but there's something goes on it's
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
referred to excess swept
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
so if you had a community that had
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
really high value properties
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
that two dollars per thousand tax rate
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
might raise say two million dollars
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
but when you add up all their students
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
using these calculations
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
their cost of inadequate education might
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
only be a million dollars
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
so that's sometimes referred to
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes referred to as donor towns but
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
they get to keep that money so they
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't donate it
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
the local community gets to keep it but
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's called excess swept so if you
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
hear that term xsweb
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's where that term comes from but
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
when you're calculating aid for a
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
district public school you first
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
figure out the cost of an adequate
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
education you net it against any money
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
they raise locally through that tax
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's a state tax but it's raised locally
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
retained locally
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
so for some people they might just keep
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
their swept and they may be done with
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
but if their cost of inadequate
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
education was two million dollars
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
and they raised one million dollars who
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
swept then their preliminary grant would
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
be a million dollars it'd be the net of
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
then uh we talked a little bit about
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
stabilization um mickey's document
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
explains it and there's some
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
some eligibility issues with um if
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
you're in excess swept town you don't
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
receive stabilization it doesn't impact
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of communities
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
but um cost of adequate education netted
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
against the swept
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
add the stabilization grant and then for
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
2021 only
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
you added in those additional ways and
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
mickey kind of explains how those
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
programs work in these little
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
little charts here and then you add in
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid which we
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that would equal the total education
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
grant for 2021.
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh this is another lba document
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
um which describes the biennium or the
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year about to go into
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
and um a lot of the same components cost
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
of adequate education the same you minus
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
net against the swept
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
you add in stabilization but those
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
one-time aides are not there anymore
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh this is the um
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
current law 2020 2021
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then 20 state fiscal year 2022 and
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
this is this shows what the governor
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
has uh proposed for state adequacy and
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you had a chance to look at hb2
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
the governor has a language in there to
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
fix the fnr issue
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
that communities are dealing with so we
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
normally see around 45 000 um
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
45 000 eligible fnr pupils in the state
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
that numbers drop down to around 34 000
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
so it's a very significant drop because
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
of that usd wave
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
usda waiver issue so when you look at
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's a really it's pretty low and a
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
lot of that is because of the fnr issue
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the governor has a calculation for
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
when determining fnr the department will
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
look at your drop in enrollment and look
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
in your drop in your fnr
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
and you drop the percentage drop in your
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment your adma
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
cannot ex uh the drop in your fnr cannot
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
exceed the drop you see in your students
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
so if you had no drop in your students
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
between state fiscal year
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
2021 and 2022 but you saw a really big
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
drop in your fnr
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
you would bring your fnr population back
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
to what you had pre pandemic
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so when you run that calculation
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
based on current law brings it up 16 or
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
16.7 million dollars
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the the governor's budget
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
which um
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
just the only change it makes to
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy is just calculating how many f
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.839 --> 00:43:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
2021

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
that is that is going to be the new
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
figure for
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
2022 um so
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's a better document i
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
actually probably misspoke because
 
00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.109 align:start position:0%
actually probably misspoke because
adequacy

00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's a year behind so let's see if we
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
can it's a
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's towards the end um let's see if i
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay no problem uh matt you have a
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
question or a comment
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
mickey could you bring that up yeah he
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh i just brought madden he should be
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
able to speak now
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes hello chairman amber
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to uh see if i could help
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
formula and thank you mark for for
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
walking the committee through that
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
essentially another way to think about
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
how that fnr correction
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
um is intended we're looking at the
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
historical percentage of students
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
who are enrolled who qualify for free
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
and using that metric that percentage of
 
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.710 align:start position:0%
and using that metric that percentage of
students

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
and applying it to the most updated
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment figures
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
right so that historical share of
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
students that would have qualified
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
we know that there's been a federal
 
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
we know that there's been a federal
change

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
that has artificially brought down the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
number of families that are
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
filling out the the paperwork but we
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
know the need hasn't changed if anything
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
that need has increased
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
so with that looking at if you had 100
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
students before the pandemic and 28
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
qualified for fnr we would take that 28
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
and multiply it by the most updated
 
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
and multiply it by the most updated
enrollment

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh and mark correct me if you have any
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
different interpretation but i think we
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
said the same thing
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh just going at it from slightly
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
different directions yep no there's a
 
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
different directions yep no there's a
lot

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
of way to describe this situation i like
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
think about it as a pre-pandemic ratio
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that ratio is frozen in time and
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
you're guaranteed that ratio and that
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
ratio is your
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
fnr relative to your total student
 
00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.710 align:start position:0%
fnr relative to your total student
population

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
so they're going to hold you harmless to
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
that ratio that's what the governor's
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
budget does
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
so the the enrollment
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
number is going to be the enrollment
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
for 2021.
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay and you indicated
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
that we had a four percent drop
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
in school enrollment in 2021
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
yep so the governor didn't change the
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
way the
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
base adequacy enrollment so just a
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
student regular student
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment the governor didn't change
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
the way we calculate that we'll use the
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the numbers are going to be at
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we'll use those
 
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.030 align:start position:0%
the end of the year we'll use those
numbers

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
based on the governor's proposal but
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
what the governor did change was
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
how the fnr pupil amount so that
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
differentiated category
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
how that is calculated um we will use uh
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
the la
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
if hp2 passes we'll use that language um
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
currently in hb2 to bring that number up
 
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.950 align:start position:0%
currently in hb2 to bring that number up
so

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um rev uh some base adequacy will
 
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
um rev uh some base adequacy will
decline

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
because enrollments are declining so
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
base adequacy will decline but fnr will
 
00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.030 align:start position:0%
base adequacy will decline but fnr will
grow

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
grow
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
um under the governor's proposed and i
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
i want to point out too so that when
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the four percent we
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
as of october first on 2000 2020
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
compared to october 1st of 2019 so
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's where we're seeing the four
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
percent decline
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
um there will be an opportunity for
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
school districts to
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
change those or end or update those
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
enrollments at the end of the year
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so a school district may only end up
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
with a three percent decline or no
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
decline at all
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
especially if a school for example had
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
kids at the beginning of the year that
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
chose to stay home because the school
 
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.790 align:start position:0%
chose to stay home because the school
was

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
um using remote instruction for the
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
first two months a year then then came
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
in person and the kids came back in
 
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:44.950 align:start position:0%
in person and the kids came back in
person

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
we are still expecting a higher than
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
normal one perc that one percent decline
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
but there are opportunities for schools
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
to update that information
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
so this enrollment includes
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh children that are doing full remote
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
learning yes
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay so it's in person
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
plus remote as long as the child
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
continues to be enrolled in a public
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
school now if a child is doing remote
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
learning and is now
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
either doing remote learning through a
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
non-public school or enrolled in a
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
homeschool program meaning they sent a
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
letter of intent to homeschool
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
to either the commissioner or a public
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
or non-public school in the state
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is no adequacy now being paid for
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
but if the kid is at home being
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
instructed by the public school district
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and just take participating the
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
physical location of the instruction is
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
they are included in the base adequacy
 
00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:43.670 align:start position:0%
they are included in the base adequacy
counts

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
counts
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh do we have any idea what happened to
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
the home school percentage of students
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
we do um we have an estimated home
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
school percentages actually on another
 
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.190 align:start position:0%
school percentages actually on another
slide

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
when we get to it but it did it did
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
increase substantially this year
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep and yeah we have some
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of the package
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of enrollment data um
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
which is really helpful i was gonna try
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
to toggle quickly to it but um we'll get
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
to that um
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
soon enough so this is just a town by
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
town with
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed budget
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a 2023
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
yet is that correct that's correct
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
i think at this point um any estimates
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
by the department to try to estimate
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
23 would be i think would likely be
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
wildly off because
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
we have we're not even sure what's going
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
to happen with covid and you know
 
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
to happen with covid and you know
enrollments

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
enrollments
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
um i think that we might be able to do a
 
00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
um i think that we might be able to do a
better

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
job maybe estimating 23 um by the end of
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
the school year but certainly not in
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
time for the budget
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
so what do i do put zero in the budget
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
for 23.
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's probably not the best plan um
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's an option right okay
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
um fiscal 23 in the governor's
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommended budget though is using the
 
00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
recommended budget though is using the
same

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
factor yes yes yeah yeah so it's
 
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.589 align:start position:0%
factor yes yes yeah yeah so it's
basically

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh budgeted at the same enrollments and
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
and everything reserved right now i mean
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly we tried to do
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
a estimate but we just don't have any
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment data to you know
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
to see if that's going to be super
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
accurate or not
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
and you might want to remind them about
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
the warrant that is in statute just
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know when the budget amount doesn't
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
align with the actual needed
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes so yeah if the department of engine
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
the department of education has the
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant regardless of what the
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation awarded to us for
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy is and this is for both
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
traditional regulars public school
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy and charter school adequacy
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
so for example last year we
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
only had i forget the exact number
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
actually 100 and say maybe 61 million
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
dollars of appropriation for adequacy
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
but our total adequacy bill was around
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
or sorry 961 million and our total
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy bill was 963 million
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
so what the process is in the department
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
of education draws a warrant on the
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to get that excess
 
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to get that excess
appropriation

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
the other on the other side of things so
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
we had about 12 million dollars of
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
excess appropriation and education trust
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
fund well as if we're
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
anticipating that right now we have one
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
final adequacy calculation that we do in
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
april every year
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
so we do have that flexibility it is
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
um when you know we're talking about two
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
or three years out and the kids aren't
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
even in the schools yet
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
well i'll keep on moving through the
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
slides and then we'll get to some
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh so this is uh 2021 this is a
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheet that shows you if
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
you want to walk a town through the
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
formula you can
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
see the components and see them through
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
and just this is important too because
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
this has the fiscal capacity aid
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
and the free and reduced lunch aid so
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
you can see some towns are here like a
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
town like hampstead didn't
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
receive um an additional grant for free
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
or for um or for the equalized valuation
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
but then you have some towns like rotten
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
they received an additional free reduced
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
lunch count but they didn't
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
receive anything from equalized
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
valuation because they have a very high
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation and groton
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
yep so yeah that 12 threshold they they
 
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
yep so yeah that 12 threshold they they
didn't

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
achieve that threshold so they didn't
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
get any additional aid and then their
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
evp over a million dollars so they
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify for fiscal capacity to
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
spare you that's just that
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is still town by town for 2021
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
here's adequacy for 2022 current law
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
so um if you looked up above the total
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
adm was 167 for 2021
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
now it's gone down to 160 so that's
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
about a four percent drop
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the fnr numbers 45 000 and 2021
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
but current law at the moment and
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
current data that we have
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
we did a cursory scrub of the data the
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
number this number is growing
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
so it will get bigger as the year
 
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.349 align:start position:0%
so it will get bigger as the year
progresses

00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
progresses
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
um but it still appears to be a problem
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
as that communities are facing
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah you'll see that 45 000 that
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
drops down under current law and current
 
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.069 align:start position:0%
drops down under current law and current
data

00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
34 000 so that's a 24 drop
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then the governor's budget redoes
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
this calculation
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
to bring these numbers up and i think he
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
his budget brings it up to around 44 000
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't totally bring the bud up
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
to 45.6
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
000 but brings it up to closer to that
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:06.069 align:start position:0%
000 but brings it up to closer to that
number

00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a state fiscal year 2022
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
not the governor's proposed but this
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
current law representative heath
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair so i'm a school
 
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair so i'm a school
district

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i've been given my allocation
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
caitlyn sent those out to school
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
districts and i'm going into my town
 
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
districts and i'm going into my town
meetings

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's a town voting day is coming up
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i've had to prepare my budget based
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
numbers that have been given me
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
by the department based on what they
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
have they that's what it had to be
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
um so i am ending up um
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
looking like we're having a a big drop
 
00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:48.230 align:start position:0%
looking like we're having a a big drop
when

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
in fact based on hb2 it might not be as
 
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.950 align:start position:0%
in fact based on hb2 it might not be as
big

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
um and there are a couple of bills
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
coming through
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the house and senate right now that
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll look at the enrollment
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
numbers being
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
held harmless so if i'm a school
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
district what do i do
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
what would i say to my constituents if
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
they asked me
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
um what budget should i put in
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
to address the needs that are happening
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
right now in my schools
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
well i kind of hate to pass the bucket
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
on that pass the buck on this one
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
but the department of revenue really
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
controls what they will allow the school
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
district to put in for our budget
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and estimated aid so um
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
work with the department school is going
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have to work with the department of
 
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.069 align:start position:0%
to have to work with the department of
revenue

00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if you know they have a
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
process to say you know
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
we actually have found 50 free and
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch kids
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so then we can actually add them in
 
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.549 align:start position:0%
and so then we can actually add them in
or

00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
or or are they i'm not actually sure
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
what the dra
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
respon response that is but you're
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct that if the school
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
district is using the november 15th
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
estimate the department of education has
 
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.630 align:start position:0%
estimate the department of education has
to

00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
prepare the in law so we have no
 
00:56:01.359 --> 00:56:01.990 align:start position:0%
prepare the in law so we have no
flexibility

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
on what to do with that calculation that
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
a school district may be using a lower
 
00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
a school district may be using a lower
than

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
um actual state revenue
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you great answer caitlin
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
and and uh there is an opportunity as
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
some of that money comes in
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
they can hold they can retain some of
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
that money a certain percentage of it
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but you're right it is budgeting
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
challenge because the state budget will
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
come after
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
likely come after a school budget uh
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
mary i think the best thing to do at
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so um similar to the governor's
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
budget um
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
was redesigning how to calculate the
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of pupils there's another
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill out there in the senate
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135 and it's a different a
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
different calculation to
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
deal with enrollment issues and so what
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135 does is it looks at
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
what are your enrollment numbers this
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
year for all your
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
base adequacy accounts your fnr counts
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
your ell counts or sped counts
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
all of those counts and goes what was it
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
this year what is it last year pick the
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
bigger of the two numbers
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
so based on
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill senate bill 135
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
over current law it's about 45 million
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
28 million or 30 million dollars over
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
but that's another proposed um
 
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.390 align:start position:0%
but that's another proposed um
enrollment

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh recalculation nothing to the formula
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
except for how we
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
decide how many students to count and
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is a town by town so you can also
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then oh so this is the pupil data
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
it's kind of get tripped up when you
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
talk about adequacy because the student
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
count is always
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
a year behind so we're going to be using
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
the 2021 school uh 2021 school year
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to be using that for state
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the 1920 school year is going to be
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
used for state fiscal year 21
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
so there's always a lag in the data as
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
far as when you get paid
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so this just shows you some of those
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers and you can see town
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
by town how your account is doing
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is their total pupils so total
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
students and then
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
most most communities have seen a
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
decrease some communities have grown
 
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:27.510 align:start position:0%
decrease some communities have grown
their

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
their number of students like ashland um
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
and then this is the free and reduced
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
price meal eligible students
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so some communities have increased
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
the number of students they have
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
with that for that population but again
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
most have seen a decrease
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
you can see this town by town
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a bigger picture enrollment
 
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.589 align:start position:0%
um this is a bigger picture enrollment
um

00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
table and so this shows you
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
different grade levels it goes back 10
 
00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:00.630 align:start position:0%
different grade levels it goes back 10
years

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
so this is the average change year over
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
year for the 10 year period
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
so i actually took out this last because
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 20 the number is
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
impacted by the pandemic i took this out
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
and this number gets closer to one
 
00:59:13.119 --> 00:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
and this number gets closer to one
percent

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
which is kind of in line with what we've
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
seen historical if you take out
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
this year as an anomaly but um over the
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
10-year period it's uh
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment's declined by 1.6 and just a
 
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.349 align:start position:0%
enrollment's declined by 1.6 and just a
point

00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
for people too so there were a lot of in
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
the fall newspaper articles talking
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
about like a six or seven percent
 
00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:32.069 align:start position:0%
about like a six or seven percent
decline

00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
in various different districts and
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
across the state and i know you just
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
heard mark when i say a four percent
 
00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.430 align:start position:0%
heard mark when i say a four percent
decline

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
um part of that is because if you look
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
at you know so if you look at
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
preschool for example there was almost a
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
50 reduction in the number of preschool
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
kids in public schools so when you're
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
talking about statewide numbers we use
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
p through 12. um however when we're
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
talking about adequacy we're only
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
talking about k
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
through 12. um so that's just one of the
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
things that i just wanted to point out
 
00:59:57.839 --> 00:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
things that i just wanted to point out
just

00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
because there's been some confusion of
 
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.670 align:start position:0%
because there's been some confusion of
that

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
so this is okay preschool
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's okay the top says
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
public and
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
private fall enrollment
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
where where am i seeing
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
sorry it should say republican yeah
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
it should say public uh public and
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
non-public so this is private right here
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay so if i'm looking at this correctly
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's 16 994
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
in private schools yes that is the
 
01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:38.870 align:start position:0%
in private schools yes that is the
enrollment

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
that reported to us as of this fall
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so that their enrollment
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
also dropped they actually had a slight
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
increase from 20 to 21
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
um but they have can they have uh
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
experienced declines across the state
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
just like the traditional public schools
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm at about the same one percent rate
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
that this the public schools have
 
01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
that this the public schools have
experienced

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
sorry i was reading the wrong numbers
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
yep this this percentage is over the
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
10-year period but
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then the homeschool home educated
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
students that's self-reported data so
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's not as reliable as say our public
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
school data
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
um but um this is what's been reported
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
to us that number's jumped up a good
 
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
to us that number's jumped up a good
amount

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then this is representative von
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
berger this is actually the spreadsheet
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
that you had asked for
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
specifically which shows the one-time
 
01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
specifically which shows the one-time
aid

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
the federal funding that the school
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
districts have received
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then additionally the one-time state
 
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.390 align:start position:0%
and then additionally the one-time state
aid

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not actually prepared to talk
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
to you about the
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal one-time aid today during part
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
of this meeting
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
i believe tammy allen court will cover
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
that at a later date when she talks
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
about the bigger department of education
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
budget and some of our federal funding
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
um but you did ask for this so um we put
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
on here so we have
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
our enrollments and then we have to date
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
we've the schools have received
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
or there's been allocated to schools um
 
01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:09.829 align:start position:0%
or there's been allocated to schools um
three

01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
large grants and then some some smaller
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
here and there grants but three large
 
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
here and there grants but three large
school

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
grants that most schools in the state
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
have received um as part of
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
the federal aid packages that the state
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has received
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
sr-1 is part of the cares act and the
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
state received
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
about 34 million dollars that was
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
distributed to schools plus an
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
additional amount the state received
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
sps rf funding was an additional amount
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
of money that the governor
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
allocated directly out of the money that
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
the discretionary
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
money that the state had um this
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
governor chose to allocate to schools uh
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
200 per school for every single student
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
in response to kova 19
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then an additional 10 million
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
dollars of discretionary money that
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
schools could
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
apply for if they had costs above and
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
beyond the two the 200
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
per student so that was about 45 million
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have a draft sr2 allocation
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
so that's from the federal
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
carissa grant which was essentially
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
coveted cares act number two
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is going to bring another 140
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars across the state to be
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
allocated to school districts
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
to mitigate coba 19 related
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
expenses and both sr1 and sr2 were
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
allocated in a proportional amount to
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
the title 1 formula
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
that is in the federal law meaning the
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
department of education didn't have any
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of modify that formula
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
or whatnot
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
and um the sr1 allocation we put it in
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 because the department
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh distributed it at the end of fiscal
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
year 20 and school districts
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
um really hadn't gotten a chance to
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
spend any of it in 21 so most of it
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
really it will be
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
sorry in 20. so most of it will be spent
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
in 21. um the draft sr money that was
 
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.589 align:start position:0%
in 21. um the draft sr money that was
allocated

01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
or the schools were total total of the
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
award several weeks ago and that money
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
is going out
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
soon and then obviously we have the
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
one-time grants that we've talked about
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
a few times throughout this presentation
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that money
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
was received by the schools beginning in
 
01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
was received by the schools beginning in
september

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so this is all the one-time money so
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
school districts it's uh you can see
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty hefty number across the
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
state of 270 million dollars of
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
one-time unanticipated funding that
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
schools receive
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
so will the s for two money carry over
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
to next year
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay so it's it okay good
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and i mean there's a potential
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
for another award to me they're talking
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
about the federal stimulus package that
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
was passed um
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
i think it was over the weekend by the
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
house it was needs to go through the
 
01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:40.870 align:start position:0%
house it was needs to go through the
senate

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
um the senate is who knows what they'll
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
end up doing with it but you know that
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's potentially quite a bit of money
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to the state
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
um mark also just scrolled down to the
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
last feature that shows that charter
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
schools were also eligible
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
um for ester one ester ii spsf funding
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
they did not receive the extra one-time
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
disparity aid in the funding formula
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um for whatever reason but so this is
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
this is the the one-time money that
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i can't i can't read well i
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
can read the numbers but i'll
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'll look at it when i receive it from
 
01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
i'll look at it when i receive it from
mickey

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
mickey
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's all we have for our
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
presentation today and we'll
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know we actually have a half hour
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
left we'll take any questions anything
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
that we can discuss
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
um about the topics that were discussed
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
today i mean i do just want to remind
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that i believe you have
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's on monday another meeting
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
scheduled with tammy vallancourt the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
department cfo to discuss
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
individual department programs and
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
department operations
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's absolutely correct and
 
01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's absolutely correct and
uh

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
tell tammy we're very nice people okay i
 
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.870 align:start position:0%
tell tammy we're very nice people okay i
will

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
caitlin oh yes
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
mayor uh represent murray i see you have
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
your hand raised
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um back on page 41
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
can you just give a few words about the
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
holmes educated students it's fairly
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's quite an erratic number up and down
 
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
it's quite an erratic number up and down
um

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
i mean even from it's hard for me to
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
read some of the years i guess it's 15
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
to 16 to 16 to 17 that's a big drop and
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
then it's
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
creeping back up um any insight into why
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
change that dramatically so the the
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
change in the numbers is i think mostly
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the way that homeschool kids
 
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.670 align:start position:0%
relative to the way that homeschool kids
reported

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
so in the past all homeschool kids had
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
to report to the school district school
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
districts reported information directly
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the department of education
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
the laws change and so homeschool kids
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
only need to be reported to the
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
once in a child's career and it could be
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
reported to the department
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
to a non-public school to a public
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
school so the data reporting side of
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
things just changed we're not sure if
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
the number of home school kids changed i
 
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:53.829 align:start position:0%
the number of home school kids changed i
don't

01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe that it it did it's just more of
 
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.750 align:start position:0%
believe that it it did it's just more of
a

01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
self-reporting mechanism hasn't resulted
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the same type of data being reported
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up please is that a
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of the information that
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
you're getting around the students are
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
you missing information that you
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
used to get there's no department
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's no information the department is
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
required to collect that we're not
 
01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
required to collect that we're not
receiving

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
but the department is not really
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
required to receive very much at all on
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions or
 
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.029 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions or
comments

01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay once again i really really want to
 
01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
okay once again i really really want to
thank

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
everyone from doe for talking to us
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we will have um a
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
great deal of information to uh to look
 
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.270 align:start position:0%
great deal of information to uh to look
at

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
to think about and uh to try to come to
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
come to grips with um how we're
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
and what we're going to do and since
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't think that zero was a good
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
idea for 23.
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
we'll have to uh also also
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
think about that and and what uh what we
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
so if there's nothing else um
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
i will just say i will uh
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%

listen to us today talk about our
 
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.030 align:start position:0%

programs
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
these programs are very important to the
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
department and the staff that
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
administer them i think you probably see
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that today from some of the passion that
 
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
that today from some of the passion that
they

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
express when they're talking about their
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs um and so we really appreciate
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
you taking the time to listen
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
so make sure that you have all the
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate information that you need
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
when making very large budget decisions
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we know that are not taken lightly
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%

next
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
tuesday is um
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
town meeting day i
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of you are going
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
to be involved
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the town meeting business but
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
um we decided not
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
to meet on tuesday of next week because
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
of town meeting
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
and mickey did we get set up for friday
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's gonna be scheduled now so the
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
first uh three for next week
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
monday with doe wednesday i believe with
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
safety thursday with dot and
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
janet scheduling friday now
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think waiting for a time you want to
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
do 10 o'clock
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
oh um how long we run
 
01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
oh um how long we run
[Music]

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
on each of those days we'll be uh
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
extremely dependent on the number of
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions that we have
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
but i hope that we have a lot of
 
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
but i hope that we have a lot of
questions

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
because i think it's important that we
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
are able to fully understand the budget
 
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.669 align:start position:0%
are able to fully understand the budget
and

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
as hopefully all of you know
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
um ways and means did us no favor
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
when they uh when they put out the uh
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
projected revenue so they're gonna be
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
some hard decisions that
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh that we have to make and it's not
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
