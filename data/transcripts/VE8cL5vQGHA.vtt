and we do have a mix of owned
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
rented and leased facilities that we
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
operate across the state
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
those are used by all of our divisions
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
the largest number of facilities are
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
operated by
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
state police and then also dmv dmv has
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
number a state police has the largest
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
number of owned facilities
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
and we provided a
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
the following documents showing the list
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:10.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
so uh steve r
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
are those facilities i know they're
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
owned by
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh safety are they also
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
funded all of the maintenance and so on
 
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
funded all of the maintenance and so on
by

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
safety yes yes so um
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you see the listing now on the
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
screen yes
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the column here that says
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
those are owned and maintained
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
exclusively by the department
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about our facility
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance budgets and reductions that
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
they're impacting all these facilities
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
that includes the warehouse
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
and automotive garage in concord on
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
hazen drive
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
we have a dmv motorcycle rider training
 
00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
we have a dmv motorcycle rider training
warehouse

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
warehouse
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
garage behind the dmv on hazen drive
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's the fire academy buildings down
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
on smokey bear
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
so there's an admin building the dorm
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's a fully functioning firehouse
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
and then also a storage facility
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the fire academy
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
north facilities so that's up in
 
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
north facilities so that's up in
bethlehem

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
bethlehem
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
there's a classroom and there's also a
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
storage building up there
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
i i did not include fire apparatus in
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
this list so there are burn buildings
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
that we use for training that's not
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
included here i
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
kind of treat those more as equipment um
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
but for our purposes of maintenance
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
for facilities they were excluded
 
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.630 align:start position:0%
for facilities they were excluded
intentionally

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
intentionally
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
marine patrol headquarters in guilford
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
and marine patrol storage in belmont are
 
00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.589 align:start position:0%
and marine patrol storage in belmont are
both

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
buildings we're responsible for and then
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
we get into the troop stations
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so all the troop stations with the
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
exception of b
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
are owned and maintained exclusively by
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
troop b if you see is actually um it's a
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
joint agreement we have with the
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
and so we have an mou and there's
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
certain expenses that
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for in certain
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
expenses that we're responsible for
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we have we have um some funding
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility but it's not exclusive
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
um then we have the state police hangar
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
the gun range
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
um both state police facilities
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
and then the dmv in dover is the only
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
the dmv that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
uh that operates exclusively for uh with
 
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh that operates exclusively for uh with
safety

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
the next column is administrative
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
services so dos headquarters 33 hazen
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
drive if you think of the department of
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
safety building on hazen
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a das facility as is the dmv
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh headquarters on hazen drive so those
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
are both owned and operated by
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
by administrative services we pay rent
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that rent includes
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance that needs to happen on
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
those on those facilities
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
we'll work really closely with admin
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
services to um
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
to identify projects that need to be
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
completed um
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and especially long-term projects so
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
like for example
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
there were um we need to replace all the
 
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
there were um we need to replace all the
carpeting

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
carpeting
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
over in the dmv facility in the last
 
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.829 align:start position:0%
over in the dmv facility in the last
biennium

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and that was a long-term project we
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
worked with administrative services on
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
that they funded but we we helped to um
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh we helped to direct in some in some
 
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
uh we helped to direct in some in some
regards

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
regards
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
the ipoc um down in smokey bear that's
 
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.190 align:start position:0%
the ipoc um down in smokey bear that's
where

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
homeland security is the emergency
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
operations center
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh the fire marshal's office 911
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
state police the other people the other
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
tenants there are d.o.t
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
so that the traffic management center is
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
operated out of that facility
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
the emergency communication services
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
garage in that area is a das facility
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
as is a laconia building up on the old
 
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
as is a laconia building up on the old
school

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
campus 911 operates out of that area
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
but it is technically a das a das
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
building although
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
in all these cases too um we do work
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
closely with
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
with the department of administrative
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
services and um
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've we've been known to help address
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
shortfalls they have in their budget
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
if there's an operational need that that
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
we have so
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
um it's a good it's a good collaboration
 
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
um it's a good it's a good collaboration
uh

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
the other das building is the milford
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh courthouse um so the the
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
the the courts um
 
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
the the courts um
[Music]

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh the dmv milford location operates out
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the new milford courthouse
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's another area that that we
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
don't have direct responsibility for
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and that's a rental the bottom uh
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
locations the dmv keen through the dmv
 
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
locations the dmv keen through the dmv
gorham

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
gorham
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
these are all leased spaces so we have
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
contracts with vendors
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
we lease the space to establish a new
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
space we typically
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
need some fit up costs it's about 150
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 200 000
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
depending on the location to to get it
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
into the working order for dmv purposes
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
but these are our leased facilities that
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we have agreements with moving
 
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.829 align:start position:0%
that we have agreements with moving
forward

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
so that's our that's our entire listing
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
the first column are really those that
 
00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
the first column are really those that
draw

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
draw
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
on the maintenance costs that we're
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
asking for in our budget
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
everything else to a lesser extent and
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
obviously with the least spaces there's
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
very little that we're responsible for
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
aside from computers and networking and
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
um if there's no other questions on this
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
item i'll move on to the
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
i think we have a question steve

the
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to actually work with
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
the national guard
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
and when we had a crisis in new
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%

does
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
that building get used to that extent
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
um is it just in emergencies or is are
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
there things going on all the time there
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
um there's things going on all the time
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
there so the the
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
911 psap the public safety answering
 
00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
911 psap the public safety answering
point

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
for uh concord that's one of our two
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
locations they're there 24 7.
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
so there that's that's where their
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
location all of the
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
homeland security staff that that
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
operate throughout the year regardless
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
of an emergency
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's where their business offices are
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the fire marshal's office
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's where his his offices are
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
located as well
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
um the it does get additional usage
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
significant additional usage when
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
there's an activation um and that's
 
00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
there's an activation um and that's
where

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
the um the the the emergency operations
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
center section
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
which has separate um workstations for
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
each emergency service function
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
those become activated and we'll have
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
members from
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
from the administrative services
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
procurement team will have a desk
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the the the national guard might
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a desk
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
and state police might have a desk and
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
we bring in hhs
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
if it's public health all those
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
different components and representatives
 
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.350 align:start position:0%
different components and representatives
from

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
all state agencies that have a response
 
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
all state agencies that have a response
response

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
response or a responsibility to respond
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
um and and yes it's extremely busy in
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
those cases when it's activated
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
but there isn't standard level of um
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
of operation that occurs because we do
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
have three of our bureaus
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
operate their all of their activities
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
out of that facility
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know you know representative heath
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
too i'll just add in not only with
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
colbit but
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
we've made such um significant
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
advancements with the technology with
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
being able to stream video whether it's
 
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.150 align:start position:0%
being able to stream video whether it's
from

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
drones or our uh helicopter but
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
every event that we um managed over the
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
course of coburn whether it was protest
 
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.509 align:start position:0%
course of coburn whether it was protest
um

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
the issue with the beau power plant um
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
any any serious
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
incident we meet there at the situation
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
room and we're able to
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
to manage it from there and actually see
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
live video
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
and um you know and so so you know
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
unified command takes place here so more
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
and more it's going to be
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
getting used more and i credit rick
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
bailey the other assistant commissioner
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
with really
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
improving and steve's got some capital
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
project a capital project he'll be
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
discussing tomorrow to
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
to advance the technology there to
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
actually see
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know and allow the governor and
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
leadership to see what's going on in the
 
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.350 align:start position:0%
leadership to see what's going on in the
field

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
which um years ago we just didn't have
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the ability to do
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a critical piece of uh of
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
of government property
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you i
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
think it's just phenomenal what you're
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
are there any are there any other
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions at this time
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay steve if you would go ahead
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
okay um so the next item
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
here is the uh position count
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
and did that's did the screen change did
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
you see you see the position count
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
listing yes oh i'm sorry representative
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
bucco had a question
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
no i'm not i'm chair um the question is
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
on this category that he's going into
 
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.829 align:start position:0%
on this category that he's going into
now

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay do you want to ask that question
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
now or do you want to wait
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh well okay i'm looking at the 23
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded trooper positions and i'm
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
wondering if they have a dollar amount
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
for that for those 23 positions i i'm
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
assuming that that's a priority so
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
so um that's a that's a great question i
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have the figure
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head that i could
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
provide that to you
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
those are just as a reminder those are
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
23 trooper positions that were unfunded
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
several biennium
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
ago so they were not funded in the
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
previous budget
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
we've been carrying these unfunded
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
positions for a very long time
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
and so at this point we're not
 
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:10.470 align:start position:0%
and so at this point we're not
requesting

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
to have those funded because we have
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
other needs as well
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
but to show the uh to tie out the full
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
position count to what's in the budget
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're being presented here
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh would you still like to know the the
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding those
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
or um is that something that you that
 
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.710 align:start position:0%
or um is that something that you that
you

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
would not need uh well sure i mean
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
if if you can provide it easy enough i
 
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.029 align:start position:0%
if if you can provide it easy enough i
guess

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay um so that's the
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
so so the total authorized count is
 
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:45.990 align:start position:0%
so so the total authorized count is
exactly

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
that total authorized positions within
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
the 2223 budget
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
um as representative bucco mentioned the
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
next column
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
troopers previously unfunded those are
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
those are troopers from
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
previous biennium they were not funded
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
um we have not had these resources for
 
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
um we have not had these resources for
um

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
for for several years and um we're not
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.789 align:start position:0%
for for several years and um we're not
requesting

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
to to um add these positions at this
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
time but they're there to show
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
they are authorized and they'll continue
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
to be authorized into the next biennium
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
and be available for funding if new
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
funding becomes available
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
the next column is newly unfunded
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
positions in 2223
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
so these are the positions that we spoke
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
about as our prioritized needs in our
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
presentation last week
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
and this lays them out into each
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
division and the accounting unit number
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
and name
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
to show you where the unfunded positions
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
are and that's the total of 50
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
in total 50 down here in total
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
these are the positions that we are
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
requesting to be funded if
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
if if there is additional funding that's
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
available and we have a separate
 
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.789 align:start position:0%
available and we have a separate
document

00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
that prioritizes these as well as our
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
other needs
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
so then your total funded count is the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
last column here
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
so there's your total funded positions
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
for the year so for example
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at the second line financial
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
management and planning bureau within
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the division of administration
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have 20 authorized positions there's
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
three that are unfunded in this budget
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
so if if this budget moves forward as as
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
is there would be 17 um funded positions
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
in 2223
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
um and then we were asked to provide
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
what the funding sources were
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's what this is here it's a
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's a percent breakdown
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
general highway turnpike federal and
 
00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.310 align:start position:0%
general highway turnpike federal and
other

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
and so in some cases they're 100
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
funded by other funds for example the
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
first row here
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
petroleum pollution that area is funded
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
by environmental services
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that's work we do for the department
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
of environmental services so that's a
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
hundred percent other
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
but financial management and planning is
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
an area that is funded by the
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
many sources of revenue we have in the
 
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.070 align:start position:0%
many sources of revenue we have in the
department

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
or funding sources we have including
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
general funds highway funds
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
and also a mixture of other funds
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
the one thing i'd like to make sure that
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
everyone understands we see these
 
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:16.900 align:start position:0%
funding mixes and sometimes
 
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
funding mixes and sometimes
[Music]

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
i i want to make sure that everyone
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
realizes regardless of
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
the availability of funds we do have
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
some ability
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
to accept for example accept general
 
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
to accept for example accept general
funds

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and then fund a position that was
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
funded with other
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
positions here we would do that by
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
changing the mix in a different
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to free up funds in that
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
other area
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i i just don't i
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
just don't want the committee to think
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
that if there's something in highway
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
or turnpike well we know we have
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
we don't have additional revenues in
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
those areas but if there are additional
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
revenues in general funds
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see we don't have a lot of
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
hundred percent generally funded
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh activities um but that's okay so
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
there is an ability to fund
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
these other positions by allowing us to
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
reduce our draws on the highway fund
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
in different accounting units um and we
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be happy to make those adjustments
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
if additional funds are available
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um could you
 
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um could you
clarify

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not those newly funded
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
um in this column the newly unfunded
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
yes yes there's there's nine positions
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the 50
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
that currently have um that are
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
currently filled
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you and um madam chair if i may
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
one more question please
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
certainly um do you have a maintenance
 
00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
certainly um do you have a maintenance
of

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
effort for all the various funding
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
sources that you have to sustain
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
um can you define maintenance of effort
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
i mean um because their federal dollars
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
often there's an amount of money that
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
this has to be from the general fund or
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
um to balance i understand so it's
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
millions of effort
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
yep so in some in some of the federal um
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
and some of the federal funding sources
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we have there is a
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
there is a it's it's a matching
 
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.470 align:start position:0%
there is a it's it's a matching
requirement

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
um um not specifically in moe but it
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is a matching requirement in some
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
federal um highway monies that we
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
receive um
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
through through nitsa and then also
 
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
through through nitsa and then also
through

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the mix-app grants that support
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
commercial uh motor vehicle enforcement
 
00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
commercial uh motor vehicle enforcement
uh

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so those matching funds are built in
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
throughout our budget so that we're
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
we typically match those expenditures
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
with highway funds
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so that that does provide kind of a
 
00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.669 align:start position:0%
and so that that does provide kind of a
a

00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
um almost a sunk cost to us for those
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
highway funds to maintain the existing
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
madam levels by one more quick question
 
00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:10.549 align:start position:0%
madam levels by one more quick question
just

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
certainly no problem thank you um
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
are are any of those funds at risk
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
because of the current proposed budget
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
since some of these positions come from
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
multiple they're funded by multiple
 
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
multiple they're funded by multiple
sources

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
can you just walk me through how you
 
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
can you just walk me through how you
determine

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
which what you're going to put where i
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
mean you have control more or less over
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
um but you know this one of financial
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
management some of it is general some of
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
it is highway some of it is
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
other how do you stretch that
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
out um with the monies that we give you
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
does that make sense i'm not sure i'm
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
asking it correctly
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
i think that maybe yeah i think i
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand the question um
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
how do we determine what percentages are
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
where we're charging
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
are appropriate in those different
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
funding sources
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that's really an area that for the
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
most part is
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
is um not exclusive to administration
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
but that's what we're looking at at the
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
top of the list
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
we we take information about the
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
services that
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
the financial management and planning
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
bureau provides to all the divisions
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the department and we develop a
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
weighted average
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
calculation looking at the number of
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
invoices we process
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
for state police for all those different
 
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
for state police for all those different
areas

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
we look at the the revenues that we
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
collect and book
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
the facility maintenances that we
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
perform all those different components
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
and develop a weighted average
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then utilize that to allocate our
 
00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:48.230 align:start position:0%
and then utilize that to allocate our
funding

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
as justification to help support that
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up certainly thank you
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
do you change those weighted averages
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
based on say need of one particular
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
position over another position in order
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure you have money for that or
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
are your weighted averages really tied
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the usages of those
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
positions so um they're tied to
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
the activities not the position so it's
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it's really along the same
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
lines as the question that
 
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.310 align:start position:0%
lines as the question that
representative

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
murray asked and i'm just sort of
 
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.909 align:start position:0%
murray asked and i'm just sort of
wondering

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
um is it possible and if so
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
you know would it do you do this or
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to do this just
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
to since you have this ability to sort
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
of move
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know monies uh from one
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
from or positions from being funded a
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
certain percentage by one category of
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
funds or another
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to try to
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
re do a reallocation in a way that
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of prioritizes in other words
 
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.310 align:start position:0%
um sort of prioritizes in other words
the

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
so that the the the positions or the
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
activity that you
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
regard as the most important and then in
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
a sort of declining
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know level of importance we're
 
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
you know level of importance we're
funded

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
um by the most secure source of income
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then you know kind of reducing that
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
as the level of of priority reduced
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's very clear but
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's do you get sort of the idea that
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah very clear and um
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
and it's clear because that's that's
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we've done
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
so essentially that's the approach that
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
we took it was
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
not limited to positions
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
because we were looking at the budget as
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
a whole because there are operating
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
costs that drive those decisions also
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know we need positions the the best
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
example i can give you is
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
a trooper without a cruiser can't
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
perform trooper duties
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
so if i have a body and no car i might
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
as well not have the body
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
we um so when we looked at it
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
holistically we've made
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
several adjustments to our funding
 
00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:19.590 align:start position:0%
several adjustments to our funding
sources

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
because of those issues because we had
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
weaknesses in general funds and highway
 
00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:24.389 align:start position:0%
weaknesses in general funds and highway
funds

00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
and and it was a it was prioritizing
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
um those services those public safety
 
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.269 align:start position:0%
um those services those public safety
services

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we felt were the most important the
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
highest priority
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
and kind of working our way down from
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
that that ability is the same ability
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
that we would use
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
in reverse if additional funding were
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
where then we would look to see can we
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
almost i don't want to say undo
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
but we would we would reassess where
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
those funds could be used
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
um appropriately to fund existing needs
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
including some of these vacancies
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
but that that that's something that we
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
did i mean as an example
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
um in administration we
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we conducted our our internal
 
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
when we conducted our our internal
allocation

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
or our indirect cost allocation to
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
develop these these
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh percentages we added um the criminal
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
records area to that allocation and we
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
we had never charged them for services
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
that we provided in the past
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
but that's a dedicated fund that's
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
healthy we know people are requesting
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
criminal records um the revenues are are
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
in a good spot
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
um they weren't paying their fair share
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
in previous budgets
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
we re-looked at that identified that and
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
now in this budget they are paying their
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
fair share
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
um so we made some adjustments like that
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
the other big adjustments uh had to do
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
with moving
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
entire divisions and or accounting units
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
from one source to another
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
so one had to do with the fire marshal's
 
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
so one had to do with the fire marshal's
office

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
fire safety and they were funded by
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
about 2.3 million in general funds in
 
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:03.269 align:start position:0%
about 2.3 million in general funds in
2021

00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
because of the weaknesses in general
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
funds and because we needed to
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the entire department was
 
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.789 align:start position:0%
make sure that the entire department was
funded

00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
we moved the fire marshal back onto the
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
fire fund
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
100 funded where in the previous year it
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
was only about half
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
general half fire funds so
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
we made those adjustments um because of
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
the lack of funding in the traditional
 
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
the lack of funding in the traditional
sources

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
and while we would the the decision
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
making behind that was prioritizing
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
um certain public safety services
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
including law enforcement
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
um which which is a you know a key area
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know judging that
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
those are great questions and like i
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
said i want to give steve won't take the
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
credit but
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a process to get to this
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
point he is thought outside the box and
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
knowing there are challenges with the
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
highway fund cost of collection and the
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
general fund trying to find the most
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
stable fund is
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
is you know as representative omburger
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
probably she's been dealing with this
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
for years is
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's the question here
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
but you know we don't have these
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
conversations with division of emergency
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
services communications 9-1-1 because
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
their fund is
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
is more stable but you know what steve
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i have said
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know time and again is we just want
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the positions are funded
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
and um you know he does have the ability
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
to if you know we do can secure more
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
general funds to
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know to reappropriate it and blend
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
to this you know this mix mixture to
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
keep the employee employed
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
so we do have some flexibility there but
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge and
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
and steve has done uh he's done a
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
magnificent job
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
getting it here but again we don't care
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
where the funding comes from
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
as long as um as we get it
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
sure no i i appreciate that and i and i
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you i mean it just it sounds
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
like this is really
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
a monumental task to to kind of do to do
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
that and i
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
i i i applaud you for for your efforts
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
steve so thank you thank you and uh
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
steve mentioned that you have uh
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
50 new unfunded positions
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
this time do you have a
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
priority list of those positions
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
or i know they're probably all priority
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
no no we do we uh we do mammoths
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i and i know steve can you know he's
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
prepared to share that
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
out of the 59er niner filled and
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
and how did we get to that list of
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
priority i mean
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't just do this in a vacuum i
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
mean we've been dealing with all seven
 
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
mean we've been dealing with all seven
directors

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
you know understanding the needs but
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
what we've tried to do is look at it
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
from a department level in other words
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure when steve started
 
00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure when steve started
this

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
sharing some of these doit costs is we
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have one division
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know succeed and have six others you
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
know so we tried to look at
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
balancing the public you know the impact
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the entire department so
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
to answer your question yes we do we
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
have a list of priority needs
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
um uh the lab is right at the top and
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
steve can uh
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i um we do and that's and that's a
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
document that um that we've shared with
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
you and we have that as the next
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
document if you'd like to go through
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i mean it's a large list and i don't
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
if if you want us to necessarily go
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
through each position
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
separately but at least we can maybe
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an overview of what it
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and you'll see what our priorities
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
are but i think
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
i just want to reiterate what the
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner said
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
one all that hard work that we did
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
jocelyn c santiago she she runs our
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
financial management planning bureau
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
and she she's on the call i don't know
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
if i can see her or not but
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
um she's really um she's done a
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
tremendous job this is her first budget
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
she's learning the department of safety
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
she's relatively new with us
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
and this is the type of stuff that she's
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
been helping us with and helping us
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
figure out and she's done a
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous job so it's it's our team
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
here that that
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
makes this possible because it's it's
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
just so complex
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
but when we made these decisions and
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
looked at our funding priorities
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
it always came back to public safety
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
service delivery
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we didn't want to eliminate services
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
but we realized there would be impacts
 
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.509 align:start position:0%
but we realized there would be impacts
and

00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
where can we minimize that impact so
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe there's additional delays
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
but a service isn't cut and and um
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
that those were hard discussions and and
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
we really had to kind of dig deep to
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
find those
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
those pieces and that's where we came up
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
with these
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
these 50 positions the prioritized list
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
then took it that next step further
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
saying okay if we could fund some
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
which are the areas that are higher risk
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
higher priority for us
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
again to minimize the impact that
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
assuming we can't fund all of them
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
let's have the biggest impact that we
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
can with any that could be funded back
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
so all right uh representative heath you
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
question yes ma'am tia thank you so for
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
the nine people who
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
will um lose their positions
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
will they have other positions or does
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
this mean that they're out of work
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
so we will explain yeah yeah so
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question i'll let
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
steve um
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
um take clean up on it but you know the
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
these are hard decisions to make and as
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
steve said
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the emotional um response
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
would have been to put those as the top
 
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.510 align:start position:0%
would have been to put those as the top
nine

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
but what's in the best interest of the
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
state and delivering this public safety
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
services so
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
we really looked at that and um and
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
placed those positions as needed not um
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
looking at you know individuals because
 
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.349 align:start position:0%
looking at you know individuals because
that's

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
that is what i think is our our
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the state
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
however there are our options and i know
 
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.630 align:start position:0%
however there are our options and i know
that

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's our goal to to to find options
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
for these individuals and hopefully our
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
goal is you know at the end of this
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
process that um
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know that we'll secure the funding
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
we need for them so
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes we are looking at at more options
 
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.630 align:start position:0%
yes we are looking at at more options
but

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
simply to put them one through nine
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
because they're funded
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
is not um that that would not accomplish
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
what were
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know our responsibility steve what
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
would you like to add to that please
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah i mean everything the
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner said is
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
is spot on um we we had discussions with
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
each individual
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
who was impacted um so that they know
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
what we know
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
and let them know that we can't
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee anything
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
but at this stage in the budget the
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
funding for the position
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and um we're working with
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
everyone if there's alternatives
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
for them if there's vacancies we can
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
move them into you know that's an active
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
process that will happen
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
now through through the out the budget
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
process um
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
even but but again we hope that funding
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
will be found
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
at some point so that um it's really a
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
move point
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounds like
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
someone's phone is ringing
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh could we ask to please uh
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
go on mute i don't know who it was but
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead speak so then the next uh
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
item to share is that list of priorities
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
um and so what you'll see here
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
is i'll probably make it a little bit
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
that way whenever you and everyone else
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
gives me high strain okay
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
how's that a little bit better that's
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
better steve
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
all right great so like the commissioner
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
said like we just mentioned these are
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
really based on
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
um what the service delivery
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
demands are um for the state and public
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
safety in the state
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
um this list starts with all of our
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
50 positions um and then it includes
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
some other
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
priorities at the end you'll see the
 
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.349 align:start position:0%
priorities at the end you'll see the
first

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
six positions here have to do with the
 
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
six positions here have to do with the
lab

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
lab
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
so these are criminalists um two
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
criminalists in
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
toxicology those are our highest
 
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
toxicology those are our highest
priority

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh requests we also have two
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
criminalists in our digital evidence
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
area uh and this is an area that's
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
really been a a focus
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
for the department uh and the lab
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's been an increased demand for
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
digital evidence processing everything
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
nowadays is on your computer on your
 
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.069 align:start position:0%
nowadays is on your computer on your
phone

00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
um there's it's just part of much of the
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
case work that we do
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely a need for this
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
specialty in the lab
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so those are a close second behind
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
the toxicology positions
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
can i steve can i add to that just so on
 
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:19.829 align:start position:0%
can i steve can i add to that just so on
those

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
that digital evidence just understand
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
this too
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um rolling out this
 
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.310 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um rolling out this
digital

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
evidence project to get cameras
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
body cameras cruiser cameras but we're
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to maintain
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
all department digital evidence think of
 
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
all department digital evidence think of
that

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
every photograph from a major crime case
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
every crash
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
pictures of evidence how is it taken in
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
the field in the cruiser
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
from the person and then transmitted
 
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
from the person and then transmitted
stored

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
stored
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh you know ultimately whether
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be uh
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
responsive to a 91a or get to a public
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
defender or to superior court or federal
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
court so
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
huge project which we have underway
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and before i go any further i
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
should probably just show you the
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
the sheet and what we have here so first
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
column is your
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
division impacted second column is the
 
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
division impacted second column is the
priority

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we have the position name or the
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
priority name of a brief description of
 
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.069 align:start position:0%
priority name of a brief description of
what

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
the role is and why it's important and
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
then we have the total cost so this is
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 and then that's been split
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
up by funding source
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
um because i know that that's an area
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
that people were interested in
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
so general funds highway turnpike
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
federal and then
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
other um and then if the source of funds
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
for other if there is another we've
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
included that here
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
as well so that you have the full idea
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
of what the what the
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
resources are um but again like we said
 
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
resources are um but again like we said
before

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i i wouldn't i wouldn't focus too
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
heavily on those funding sources because
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
we do have some ability to address those
 
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.790 align:start position:0%
we do have some ability to address those
needs

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of funding so
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
fifth criminal evidence technician this
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
is really a critical role
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the lab if as far as logging and
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
tracking evidence that comes
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
in and then goes and then the results
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
that go back out
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
so this has to be done and if this isn't
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
done by
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
a criminal evidence technician it will
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
be done by a criminalist
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's done by a criminalist the
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
criminalist can't do actual
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
analysis work so um that's another uh
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
critical need in that area and then also
 
00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:30.309 align:start position:0%
critical need in that area and then also
a

00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
specialty and pattern evidence um so we
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
have two vacancies and pattern evidence
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
and this is one
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
that we would be requesting to fill to
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
meet demands for those services
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh the next section is the attorney for
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the hearings bureau um so that's
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
really the lead attorney for all the
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearings
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
and they that's this is an area where
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
could the bureau survive without this
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
position um it could
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have decreases in um
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have increased case
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
loads you're going to have decrease in
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and the amount of cases that can be
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
completed and challenges
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
scheduling things timely and there are
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
some things that have
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
um that have timing requirements uh but
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um those we would we would prioritize
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
but there is always going to be that
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
increased risk that
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
we don't complete something within a
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
statutory deadline
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
if we don't have all of our positions
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
steve the other thing too with that it's
 
00:41:29.839 --> 00:41:30.630 align:start position:0%
steve the other thing too with that it's
important

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of things have been put on delay
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the data you look at based
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
on covid whether it's
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know the drugs coming into the lab
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
but all of our inspections are auditing
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
on the uh mechanics and dealers you're
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
gonna see
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the things that are starting to come
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
from the courts once the courts the
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
license suspension the
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
the dwi trials the administrative
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
suspension so
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
we have to be prepared this position
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
always existed and the gentleman who was
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
the number two retired so
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's it's a critical position for
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
um the next position is this is actually
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
a new
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
full-time position in the dmv it's a
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
program assistant to oversee the
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
ignition interlock program
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
um so that was done by a part-timer in
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
it really requires full-time uh a
 
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.589 align:start position:0%
it really requires full-time uh a
full-time

00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
full-time hours to manage this position
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
and so working with director bilecki
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
even with vacancies that she has in
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
other areas this program is critical
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we need this position to make sure
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
that it's continuing
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
moving forward that position too
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh that manages the most at-risk drivers
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
we have those who have been convicted of
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
either aggravated
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
dwi or dwi second we've dealt with a lot
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
of fraud with the interlock
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
um so it's we're really moving in the
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
right direction but
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of risk there and
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to move that program in the
 
00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:58.590 align:start position:0%
right direction for public safety
 
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
right direction for public safety
[Music]

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
the next is also a dmv oops dmv position
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a licensing examiner
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
these are the people who issue the road
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
tests to our uh to new drivers
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um again delays in service are a
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
result if we don't have people
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
able to conduct the um the the driving
 
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:20.550 align:start position:0%
able to conduct the um the the driving
exams

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
exams
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
um as it is there's already delays as
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're working through
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
coveted backlogs because there were
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
there wasn't quite an opportunity to
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
have all those
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
um all those tests happening during
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
covid um
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
but regardless there's a general demand
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
for new licensing
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
and testing and um our our structure was
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
built for the
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
pre-code general demand and that
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
requires that we fill
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
fill these positions otherwise there
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
will be delays even after we get through
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
the backlog
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
the human resources technician in the
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
division of administration this is the
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
risk management position
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
so this is the position that processes
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
all of our fmla
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
requests workers compensation um
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
ada accommodation requests uh
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
it it they need to be the subject matter
 
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
it it they need to be the subject matter
expert

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
expert
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
for all of these items and these impact
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
our employees these decisions that that
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
are being made
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
impact our employees on on in their jobs
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
and on what type of leave they might be
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's very specific work that requires
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
someone who's familiar with these areas
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
and has a good understanding of the
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
ins and outs of the law and we're this
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
vacancy right now so this job is being
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
done by thankfully we have
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
someone in our payroll department who
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
used to do this work
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so she's wearing two hats right now
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we're hurting in payroll
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
because we have to do these things and
 
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:41.910 align:start position:0%
because we have to do these things and
again

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
deadlines and the such um the next
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
is i don't i don't think we need to go
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
through each one of these
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh we've got the information here
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
and um i can probably pretty much
 
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
and um i can probably pretty much
guarantee

00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
from the house side that
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
if we're able to get maybe one through
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
five that
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
you should be happy but uh we'll
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens but i appreciate
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
the work that has gone into um
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know this priority list and uh
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
and what and and how you approached it
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
i think that that is uh is remarkable
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
and i know that obviously there were
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
very tough decisions that had to be made
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
and and i i really appreciate it so
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
if we could press on to the next area
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
very good thank you and and thank you
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so then the last item that we have
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
is the list of the services currently
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
offered by the dmv
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
so there are online services that dmv
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
provides across the state anyone with
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
internet connection can schedule
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
their their appointments their driver
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
license exams
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
they can renew their driver license
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
they can apply for duplicates they can
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
pay their their tickets
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
so online ticket pay if it's a if it's a
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
plea by mail they can make those
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
payments they can issue non-guilty pleas
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
they can complete motorcycle rider
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
training applications
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a real id document
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
checker to make sure that all the
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
documents that are required
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
um that the individual has them and that
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the appropriate
 
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.430 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the appropriate
documents

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
so those services can happen online um
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
but there's certain things that
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
that can't happen online and you need to
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
be in person
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
for um your eye exam which is required
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
to obtain your license
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
you need to take your your knowledge
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
test on site
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
um you need to be on site to take your
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
driving test
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
and so those are the services that are
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are offered um
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
across the list of locations here
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
we've got um the 14 locations
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
and what we've done director bilecki's
 
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
and what we've done director bilecki's
really

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
changed how the dmv functions because of
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
and um and it's really i think there's
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
some positive changes that have
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
have come of that and will likely stay
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
with us or may stay with us
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
even after we're back to a more normal
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
case so
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
the dmv has always had a call center
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
what really expanded the ability to take
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
calls and helps help employees by calls
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
at all locations
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
the dmv added a dropbox function to send
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
paperwork in
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
outside of each area so secure boxes
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
outside the location
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
so then the paperwork be completed and
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
maybe follow up with phone calls and
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
processed after the fact
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
instead of walk-in service which we had
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
concerns about social distancing
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
the dmv moved to an appointment-based
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
service and this is something that the
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
customers have really
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
had a positive reaction to so gone are
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
the days of
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
going to the dmv and hoping for the best
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
and standing in line
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
now you have an appointment and so now
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
at least you can plan your day around
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
that time you know whether this can make
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
be maintained
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
um throughout the normal course of
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
business as volume increases we'll have
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
but it's been a very it's been very well
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
received by um by
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
the customers at the dmv and then we've
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
got our knowledge test
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
could you hang on just a second uh
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray has a question
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
not so much a question i need to move to
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
another room so i'm going to be off for
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
about three or four minutes as i grab my
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
laptop but we've got people coming in
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a zoo so i need to go
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
to a quiet room
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be right back okay no problem thank
 
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
i'll be right back okay no problem thank
you

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead steve and then you see the last
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
two columns show
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
the knowledge test appointments and the
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
road test appointments
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and the frequency of when they're
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
offered in our in our part-time
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
locations up in colebrook and gorham
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see the dmv really has a a
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
a good footprint across the state um
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the intention is to be providing
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
convenient service
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
to uh to all the employees out of all
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
the divisions at all the departments and
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
in state government i can't think of
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
another one that has
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
that that really impacts this more
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
people than the dmv does because
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
anybody with a driver license anyone who
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
owns a vehicle
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
um they're having some interaction with
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
the dmv
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we're talking millions of people um
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
um but these are these were this was one
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
of the requests that came up what types
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
of services are available online what
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
types of services are offered
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
um in person and how can you obtain your
 
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.950 align:start position:0%
um in person and how can you obtain your
services

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and so this chart kind of shows that for
 
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.390 align:start position:0%
and so this chart kind of shows that for
you

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative umbrella i'll just
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
say that you know through covert when
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
covert we opened up the eoc
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
march 10th obviously you know commercial
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
truck drivers had to keep delivering ppe
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
we had to keep
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
we had to keep moving and i will say she
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
only closed for two days
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
48 hours to get things in place and
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um i gotta tell you the the the money
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's been invested in the dmv
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
by the state has been has really served
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
the state well
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
if you look at that qmatic scheduling
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
system that's a game changer
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know we were dealing with thousands
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
of phone calls a call center that we're
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to staff
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
now folks can just go online what is it
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do where do you want to
 
00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:24.549 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do where do you want to
go

00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's like booking a flight and
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
um you can cancel it
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
so it's like i said there are a few
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
services that you'll always have to do
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
in person
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
but she has checked the boxes off on all
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
these that steve spoke up
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
we've got three that are planned for the
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the future so
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
um i would say that when i said it
 
00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
um i would say that when i said it
before

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have one of the best
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
running department of motor vehicles in
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
the country and
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
i got a call yesterday from somebody out
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
of state that had to do service
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
with the dmv yesterday and said i am i
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
can't tell you
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
how impressed i am and how frustrated i
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
am with my own state
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
so again the technology is important
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
but the directors get some good people
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
there working at the counters and uh but
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
but the technology has been been vital
 
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.589 align:start position:0%
but the technology has been been vital
to

00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
taking people off of phones and getting
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
them back and as judge lin will know
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
from his days in the supreme court with
 
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.069 align:start position:0%
from his days in the supreme court with
j1

00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
j1
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the advancement we've
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
made with the tickets and the not guilty
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
pleas and paying tickets and
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
everything tied back to that terrible
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
crash uh in randolph and
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward on the state to
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
state the automation of the exchange of
 
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:34.950 align:start position:0%
state the automation of the exchange of
tickets

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the passenger side we have the cdl so
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
i am thank you for the support of the
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
dmv but it's
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh i have not heard any um
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
complaints about what's going on at the
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
dmv right now
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i know that over the course of
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
you've really made tremendous
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
progress in servicing
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
the in servicing the people uh
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that uh and that i think is uh
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
is what safety is all about is
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
providing the services to uh to the
 
00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:17.990 align:start position:0%
providing the services to uh to the
people

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
that that require them and that's
 
00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:22.230 align:start position:0%
that that require them and that's
important

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you great
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
um and so then the last piece
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's not really a separate attachment
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
we we talked about the forensic lab
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
positions that are um six of the nine
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
vacant positions are our top
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
priorities um on our list but we were
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the total number of full-time
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
positions that question came up last
 
00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:43.670 align:start position:0%
positions that question came up last
time

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it's 44. um authorized full-time
 
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.790 align:start position:0%
so it's 44. um authorized full-time
positions

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
the nine that are unfunded there's two
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
in talks two digital evidence two
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
pattern evidence
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
two evidence control technicians there's
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
also an administrative supervisor
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
so our top six uh requests for funding
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
are the two toxicology the two digital
 
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.549 align:start position:0%
are the two toxicology the two digital
evidence

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
one of the pattern evidence and one of
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
the evidence control positions
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the others are on the list they're
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
just at a lower priority because again
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
the approach we took was
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
highest risk services ask for those to
 
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.069 align:start position:0%
highest risk services ask for those to
be

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
refunded first but also acknowledging
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be a delay for
 
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.030 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be a delay for
services

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
we want to minimize that wherever we can
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
and so that that really concludes the uh
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
the additional documents
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
from the follow-up questions that we had
 
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:33.910 align:start position:0%
from the follow-up questions that we had
um

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
from our first meeting and so be happy
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions that you
 
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions that you
have

00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah this is um just a quick question
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
on i thought that several years ago
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
we had uh funded additional positions
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the lab because of
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
so we had gotten so far behind in
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
drug stuff you know trying to
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
trying to figure that out so
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
is this kind of reverting back to where
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
in the lab or is um
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
is this you know
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
something else well i think if we
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
if we don't fund these two toxicology
 
00:54:26.559 --> 00:54:27.829 align:start position:0%
if we don't fund these two toxicology
positions

00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
you you could argue we're taking a step
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
back because we would we would start
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
having those same issues that we had
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
previously um there's still going to be
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
overtime money available
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
to help process things but we're limited
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
by the number of
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
hands and equipment that we have we need
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
you need someone to process them
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
so um again looking at our services
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
our initial positions being that that
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
were vacant we started with the vacant
 
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.230 align:start position:0%
were vacant we started with the vacant
positions

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is where they were and um said okay
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
based on the demand we're not shutting
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
down drug testing
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
but we have vacant positions we have to
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
meet these
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
targets that were provided there's only
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
so much money that's where the initial
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
decision came from
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they're the first priority
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
coming back in because we always hoped
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
that there might be an opportunity to
 
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
that there might be an opportunity to
fund

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of these as hopefully revenue
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
projections you typically get better as
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
we go through the process
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
your memory is correct too
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative berger and i think steve
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
those were seven ds
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
and at the time that we added positions
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with back significant
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
backlogs on the drug
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
section side but with the law changes to
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana we're no longer doing analysis
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
on you know pipes and you know you know
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know pieces of joints and so we've
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
really focused on what are the issues
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
today but back to what steve said you
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
the evidence the patent the the firearms
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
the ballistics the fingerprints so we're
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
looking at each section
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
where are the backlogs so they've
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
shifted you know it's different today in
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
in in will in this next budget you know
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
what is she dealing with and again it's
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
the fentanyl the methamphetamine but
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
equally important
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
the fingerprint section you know doing
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
whether it's footprints or and obviously
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
the dna section so we look at
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
and as steve said digital evidence is
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
um something that we can't you know fall
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you madam chair um uh
 
00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.390 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you madam chair um uh
just

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
just so clarifying um
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
the top priorities was toxicology two
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
positions uh digital evidence two
 
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
positions uh digital evidence two
positions

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes you can you could tell me if i'm
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
right or wrong
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
patent evidence was won and evidence
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
control was
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
won yes correct um
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
and i just have a question a related
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
unfunded administrative supervisor in
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
your notes it says that someone else
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
will have to do
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
his job if we don't have that position
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
a priority too um
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so yes i know they're all prior i
 
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:20.950 align:start position:0%
yeah so yes i know they're all prior i
know

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
um it is it's a matter of um at that
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
point we look at risk
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so you know the risk at
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
um performing the administrative
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
functions is lower than
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the criminalists and the subject matter
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
experts and
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario a criminalist might
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
have to do some administrative work
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
but we can never have an administrator
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
doing criminalist work
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's why that's lower down in
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
the priorities thank you steve
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um as i said
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
before i'm i'm gonna need to uh
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
leave uh now but i want to thank the
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%

and and director lavoy um for for your
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
presentation it's really been very very

informative and
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
and very helpful uh so thank you very
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay um i think
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
that uh either anybody have
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
from people that are watching us
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
i see nothing but i think this would be
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
a good time to have uh
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
department of safety walk through their
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 sections there's not many
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i think they can just uh go over
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
those real quick
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
i totally agree there there was enough
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
to make me nervous
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
in hb2 but uh yeah it's almost like the
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
bears for fish and game but
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll get to that another day
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
so okay if we could
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
um whomever wants to
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
start hb2
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right steve um mickey do you have
 
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.430 align:start position:0%
all right steve um mickey do you have
the

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry did you have a summary
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
document of division two
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh i don't but i've got the bill i can
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
share my screen and uh
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
i've got them here so um
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
um because i thought there was something
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
that was posted on the division 2
 
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.750 align:start position:0%
that was posted on the division 2
website

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we put something out that was on
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
the draft document so
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
well i can i can talk and i can if you
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
want to start doing that i can start
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about what's in
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about what's in
there

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you know for the most part
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
there there isn't anything that that
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily there is one area that
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's a that that would require some
 
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
there's a that that would require some
action

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to start there and the
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
other areas we can talk about
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know our understanding of what those
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
are those new
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh requirements are but one area is the
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the establishment of a million dollar
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
fund excuse me just a second mary you
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
page numbers please uh oh
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the document that
 
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.549 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the document that
um

01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
mickey put together for us
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
if that's that's okay hopefully
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
everybody has that
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the mix of uh whatever else they have
 
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.390 align:start position:0%
in the mix of uh whatever else they have
on

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
their dining room table would it be
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
useful representative for me to share
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
the actual house bill to
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
introduce now that we have it because i
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
did that document prior to us getting
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
the actual bill
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
so if you've i do have it here
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you have the language there that
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right oops oh sorry hold on
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
i had
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
all right can you see which one are you
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
that looks like it oh sorry hold on i've
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
got too many windows open bear with me
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
all right third time's a charm
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
what do you okay you got it okay
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay so the first the first item which
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
is our our transfer authority
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
um this is something that's really
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
critical especially
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's been made even more critical
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
because of the additional
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
allocation that we've done in this
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
budget of
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
of transferring these costs in 27 and 64
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
um out into and property casualty
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
insurance also
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
out into um whichever dedicated funds
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
they belong to that could absorb those
 
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
they belong to that could absorb those
costs

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately so this um this transfer
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
authority is is really critical for us
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
because those are typically accounts
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we cannot transfer funds
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
out of we cannot transfer appropriations
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
to or from
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and so having the ability to do that
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
in case there's a change in our
 
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.190 align:start position:0%
in case there's a change in our
allocation

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
we we have estimates we're allocating
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
based on our best information but that
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the dollars are going to
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
add up
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
exactly so we would we would this we've
 
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
exactly so we would we would this we've
had

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
this transfer authority for a number of
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
years so this would continue that
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
um one item for consideration
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
for this committee would be something
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
transfer authority but language that
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
would allow us to
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
fund unfunded positions
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
if other positions become vacant
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
throughout the year
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh that that's something that i
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
could pull some language together but
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
what that would do is um let's assume
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
that all 50 positions go
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the next budget um there are
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
some of those that are critical like
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've identified
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
if if a vacancy occurs within that area
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
in a in a service area that we determine
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not as
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
critical instead of hiring for that
 
01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:28.069 align:start position:0%
critical instead of hiring for that
vacancy

01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
we'd like to hire for the one that was
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
our priority
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
and so we would need someone's general
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
language to to uh give us authorization
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise we can't touch those unfunded
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
positions so
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah mickey i this has to be
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
and transfer specifically no no
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the unfunded positions
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
um fill them as you know as long as you
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
have money
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
um steve knows a little bit more about
 
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
the specifics of this than i do
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not i don't see anything in house
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
bill 2 related to that this time around
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's just existing authority
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
for that for the agencies
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
well i thought i saw something in um
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh some of division one things but
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
i i have no problem uh
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
personally adding that uh to uh
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 so if and i don't think it's
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
anything new i think that's been
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
essentially boilerplate for budgets now
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong steve but this
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
is a kind of carryover authority from
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
year to year
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it is and um
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and the the position the ability to
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
hire positions though
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
is has has been specific to
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
certain agencies and so i know that um
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
health and human services has that
 
01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:54.309 align:start position:0%
health and human services has that
ability

01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
they'll come to fiscal and they'll show
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
which positions are funded and unfunded
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
um we don't to my understand knowledge
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have that authority
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
um that's not a broad authority given to
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
all departments and so i i would request
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to be able to fund
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
our positions if we could get that
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.190 align:start position:0%
our positions if we could get that
authority

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh steve maybe you can work with
 
01:05:14.319 --> 01:05:15.190 align:start position:0%
okay uh steve maybe you can work with
mickey

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
mickey
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
on on whatever language we need for that
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay and represent murray you have a
 
01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.870 align:start position:0%
okay and represent murray you have a
question

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm assuming if
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's in hb2 it would just be for this
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
biennium is this something that you
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
would want to consider for the long term
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
would want to consider for the long term
or

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
is this something that it's better to
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
consider it budget to budget
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
um we'd certainly
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
like a long term if we had that
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
authority long term that would be that
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
would benefit us
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
um whether or not it's uh that's
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
could be done in time or in conjunction
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
with the budget bill would be would be
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
up for discussion but we would certainly
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
if this was formalized and
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
long-term authority we would certainly
 
01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:01.190 align:start position:0%
long-term authority we would certainly
be

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
welcome it yeah uh if i could i'm not
 
01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:05.829 align:start position:0%
welcome it yeah uh if i could i'm not
sure

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
that there is any department that has
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
long-term authority on this uh
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's something that has
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally been entered into hb2
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
as uh for you know whatever happens to
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
be going on
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh financially but i don't think any of
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
us have
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
any problem of inserting that so
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair um
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the next section in hb2 is a new
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
section related to body worn cameras
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
and what this does you know in summary
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm not going to read the whole
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
thing but essentially this establishes a
 
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:48.630 align:start position:0%
thing but essentially this establishes a
fund

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety to provide
 
01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.069 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety to provide
grants

01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
to local police departments to help
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
encourage them to implement
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
body cameras and so um
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's a million dollars that's
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated to start off
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
and it's a non-lapsing i believe it's a
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing um
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
fund that's established and um this is
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
certainly something that that that we
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
um that we support in in concept this is
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lee act recommendation
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that that body cameras be in use
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement across the state this
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
would not directly
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
provide any support for state police so
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is not state police state police
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
body cameras are within our existing
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
this is additional grant funding to for
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
locals kind of as
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
a matching component this language
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
requires the commissioner of safety to
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
work with the
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general and establish the the
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rules surrounding
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
what needs to be submitted and who can
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
obtain these funds
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so that would that would be
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
established what this does not
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
include currently is any support to
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
administer the program
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's the piece that um we would
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
request of the committee
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
we spoke with our grants management area
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
that that falls under
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
my division under division of
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
administration and um
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that we're stretched as
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
thin as possible in that
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
area we have people working on multiple
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
grants and they really
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
there's no resources to move to help get
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to where it needs to be so we
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
would likely
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
to make this happen we would need a a
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
program specialist 2 position
 
01:08:32.239 --> 01:08:35.349 align:start position:0%
program specialist 2 position
it's

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the i was looking at
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
the amounts but it's about eighty
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
a year salary and benefits um
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
for that role um and that's
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
we think that that position embedded
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
within our grants management unit
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we could utilize the um the the
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the processes that we have for our
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
existing grant uh distributions
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
but we'd have that person who'd be
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
responsible for this because this is
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to get complicated fast
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
now we i don't expect all
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
all 200 towns and municipalities with
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
police forces to participate
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
some may say we don't want to
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
participate but i think there will be a
 
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
participate but i think there will be a
large

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
response to this and so for those of you
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the compliance of grants
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
and and the application process there's
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of administrative work
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
and we think that um the best practice
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
is always if there's a new program you
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
put someone in charge of it
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
this person would be in charge of it so
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
that would be something that's not
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
funded or brought up here that we would
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
also request
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the areas that
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
is sorry representative i'll let you go
 
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.349 align:start position:0%
is sorry representative i'll let you go
first

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my question is
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
a quick one um have you maxed out all
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
your federal funds
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
that might be used for this and or if we
 
01:09:58.719 --> 01:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
that might be used for this and or if we
get

01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
new funds related to that could be used
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
in this area would this that be a
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
possibility for you
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
so we have uh maxed out our
 
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
so we have uh maxed out our
administrative

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh draws for federal funding um so that
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
was the first place we looked
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
um and then um as far as the coveted
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
piece that's a great question
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know what the what the
 
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know what the what the
restrictions

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be if there's um if there is
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
money to states that that comes forward
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
and whether this would qualify so
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at the eligibility
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
um for that
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
so representative umberger just to share
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
the one thing that i'm really uh
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
focused on and um there's a lot of
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
i would say nervousness is our own
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
camera project
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
and as you know steve knows we've got
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
money in our own budget
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
we just extended the rfp out because
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
other options for downloading because
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
we've got troopers
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know in all corners of the state
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
some with connectivity some without so
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
we've got our we've got our uh
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're gonna try and focus on our own
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
project so this is completely separate
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
am getting a lot of phone calls from
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
folks saying you know
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know how would i get money can we
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
just share some of your technology well
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't even got our own you know up
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
and running yet so
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a lot of work over
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next biennium but thankfully you
 
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:27.990 align:start position:0%
the next biennium but thankfully you
know

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
rick bailey and steve and the team you
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
know but
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
i i've got to focus on department of
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
safety and and
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
the liax you know we we're mandated we
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
have body cameras and in cruiser cameras
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
on uniform troopers
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is completely separate leak
 
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
this is completely separate leak
recommended

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement you know you know
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
utilize body cameras but again there was
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
no funding so this
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity and again it's you
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
know this is in the
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
just in the infancy stages but to
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
steve's point i agree with him if this
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be successful
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
he's got to have somebody to run the
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
program or at least assist the grants
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
management team
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
um our
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things that as i talked to
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
local folks about body cameras and
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
dash cams the
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
the digital keeping of all these records
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be phenomenal
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that we have
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
any rules or laws or whatever you want
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
to try to handle how long do we have to
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
keep these things
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
um you know because it it's going to be
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
a dis
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
well i shouldn't say that it's going to
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
be very difficult
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
for uh local police to uh
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
to manage this not only you know
 
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
to manage this not only you know
financially

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
but in uh in a in trying to
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
manage the the actual digitizing
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
of all of this stuff so i have some i
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
have some good news for your
 
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:15.990 align:start position:0%
have some good news for your
representative

01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
so steve will share the statue there is
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
a statute in place
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
for body cameras which lays out you know
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
defines you know retention you know
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's an office involved shooting
 
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
whether it's an office involved shooting
or

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that is like that isn't statute as of
 
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
so that is like that isn't statute as of
now

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
and again you know whatever company that
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's a small
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
department um the departments where all
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
the police officers
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
come and go and share cars that their
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
their storage solution can be somewhat
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
different because they've got like a hot
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
swap and it can be done there
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but you're correct it's the it's the
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
storage and that's what rick bailey has
 
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:52.709 align:start position:0%
storage and that's what rick bailey has
been

01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh why our rfp would put so much work
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
and thankfully you know dennis coulee
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and rick and
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
and a team we want to make sure we get
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
it right because if you're a trooper
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you're in colombia and you've just
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
been on patrol for eight hours and
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
maybe you've stopped several cars made
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
an arrest so how much
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
how much data is on your uh cruiser
 
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:15.990 align:start position:0%
how much data is on your uh cruiser
camera

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
camera
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
and in your body camera and how do we
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
get it to that secure location
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and then from there once it's there if
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
you made a dwi arrest
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
how does it go to the bureau of hearings
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
how does it go to the courts
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you've got a 91a so it's it's the
 
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.830 align:start position:0%
if you've got a 91a so it's it's the
storage

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
and the management of this information
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
because as you know everybody's going to
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know want to get access and we have
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that so
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and again we have the right people in
 
01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:43.510 align:start position:0%
um and again we have the right people in
place

01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i believe we'll get there but i just
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
everybody understands this is a very
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
very very big project
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't mickey could you move the
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh the body camera thing up a little bit
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay it says that you have to
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
within 180 days
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
jointly establish a process for
 
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.630 align:start position:0%
jointly establish a process for
application

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
what what you're telling me if i
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
understood correctly
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that that is probably
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit too soon from your
 
01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
a little bit too soon from your
perspective

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
no i don't think um this is just
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
i i think that's establishing the
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
process for application
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that's doable and then from
 
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
so i think that's doable and then from
there

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
once they have the funds it would be
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
incumbent on the police department
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know let's say part of the
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
application is you've got to ensure that
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
look at you've got a proposal you've got
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
a defined number of police officers
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and you can you know with let's say you
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
we've got x amount of police officers
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
we've got a vendor we can do it
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
um so i think and again i don't want to
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
overstate it but i think that is
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
that is uh i think that's doable
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i think i think the 180 days is
 
01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
so i think i think the 180 days is
probably

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.669 align:start position:0%
probably
um

01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
um it's probably it's probably fine to
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
develop the process
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
i think that we could develop the
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
process in the in that six months that's
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
six months right 180 days six months
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
um um i think in months the days always
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
throw me off
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
um the the the the concern i have is
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be adopted by rule
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
in rulemaking
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's where i think the delay
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
might come in
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
and so it might make more sense to have
 
01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:08.310 align:start position:0%
and so it might make more sense to have
this

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
to have this um extended out for
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
for a full for a year
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
or maybe at least nine months to allow
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the rulemaking process
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
because i'm assuming we wouldn't want to
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
go through emergency rulemaking
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
for something like this but again that
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
would be the legislature could always
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
decide that no that's that's fine that's
 
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
decide that no that's that's fine that's
appropriate

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
we want to we want to go that route but
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's what my concern would be is the
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
rule making piece
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
maybe holding it up but i think the
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the attorney general
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
could come up with the process within
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
180 days without without an issue
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
the statue to representatives 105
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
are you foreseeing the same vendor
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
that you would you would tell the uh
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
the police departments
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
that they all should use
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
this vendor so that the um
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
the information is seamless
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
from the local level all the way through
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
so so you know i'm gonna i'm gonna step
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
out on a on a limb here and i think that
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
um i i i don't think that that
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
is what we would be doing because like i
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
said you know that you know the
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
the rules with proposals and and and
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
the requirements of confidentiality but
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're we have no idea right now what's
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to be the best
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the best vendor for our needs
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
so every department i think will have
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
some unique needs
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that you know they will you
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
know they will
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
have the ability and flexibility to seek
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
the best vendor for themselves
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
maybe it's one that you know they know
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think we are just going to provide the
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
resources but to ensure that
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think what's important is if
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to fund it we kind of have a
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
baseline on
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
what the costs are understanding what
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know kind of some costs are
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
and making sure that um they buy the
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
equipment that
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we need now like we're gonna have
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at body cameras and in
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
cruiser cameras
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
front and rear so that be actually three
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
so a department may just want body
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
cameras but i think this
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
grant here is for would be for body
 
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
grant here is for would be for body
cameras

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and again it's it's not mandatory um so
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think you'll see a lot of interest in
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
it though quite honestly i think a lot
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
of department's going to look to
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
us for funding and i don't know how far
 
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
us for funding and i don't know how far
the

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
money will go but you know i think to
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
steve's point i think we can get
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think i will work closely with the um
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
the next attorney general
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
to get the process in place and i think
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
i think we can do it though
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
we'll get it done representative bucco
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just curious
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
with all this data
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh are we going to be starting do we
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
need our own servers or how are we going
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
to be storing all this material
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
so we the state will be worrying about
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
the 270 some odd you know state police
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
troopers that's what our we will be
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
doing with our project that we're going
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
to have to fund separately
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the local departments will have to do
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
their own i've talked to
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
many local chiefs that have them now and
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
there's no issues
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
they've got their own storage maybe some
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the clouds some have servers but
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
um so they'll you know i think they'll
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
manage it on their own you know
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
manchester's you know
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
gone in their own direction i know um
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
and some have had them for several years
 
01:20:59.679 --> 01:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
and some have had them for several years
we're

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually behind you know many of the
 
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.709 align:start position:0%
actually behind you know many of the
departments

01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
okay mickey i think we've had enough fun
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
body cameras let's go to
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
radio infrastructure this is really
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
so i also just want to make you aware
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill was drafted
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
section 145 lumps in
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
the body camera fund as well as the
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
commission established to uh
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
receive the complaints alleging
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
misconduct um
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's no real tie to the department of
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
safety with that or the appropriation
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
i feel like this was a drafting
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
oversight it probably should have been
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
separate sections so we may have to
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
coordinate a little bit with division
 
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:45.910 align:start position:0%
coordinate a little bit with division
one

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
as far as what to do um with this one
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
section there is an appropriation that
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
is included actually in the department
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
of administrative services budget
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
because it's an independent commission
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
but just that's why you see
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that section kind of lumped in between
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
some of these safety related sections
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to talk to the
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
department about that or just move on to
 
01:22:10.239 --> 01:22:10.629 align:start position:0%
department about that or just move on to
the

01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
the radio uh section down here on
 
01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
the radio uh section down here on
section

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're muted representative
 
01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:25.990 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're muted representative
thanks

01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
does the uh safety have any input that
 
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
does the uh safety have any input that
they

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
like to make on that no i understand it
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i you know i haven't been involved
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
with lee act i know what the vision was
 
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
with lee act i know what the vision was
so

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
i think mickey explains just well and
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he'll he'll get it cleaned up
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so the next section would
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
be 149 related to the radio
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure equipment
 
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
infrastructure equipment
purchase

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so this so this is an area that um
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of discussion with
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
and this has been an ongoing um kind of
 
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:58.870 align:start position:0%
and this has been an ongoing um kind of
question

01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
across the state for for years now uh
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
our division of emergency services and
 
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.709 align:start position:0%
our division of emergency services and
communications

01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh operates the state police radio
 
01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.149 align:start position:0%
uh operates the state police radio
network

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
and that network is actually utilized by
 
01:23:10.639 --> 01:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
and that network is actually utilized by
um

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
other departments as well and so we've
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
been providing services
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
um maintenance of equipment um
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
and uh to to divisions across the state
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
um free of charge for a very long time
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't had agreements to charge back
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
to different funds
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know we're we've always kind of
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
struggled with this is that what's the
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
right model for this should we have a
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
separate system
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
that everyone runs their own radio
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
should we have a state centralized
 
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
should we have a state centralized
system

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
and um the reality is is that
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of potential for us to to
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
gain efficiencies
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
if we if we work together to kind of
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
have some sort of governance over the
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
state systems
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
interoperability's really driven this
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that's been the challenge if you
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
run separate systems your equipment
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
can't communicate with others
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the more and more we're being asked
 
01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:04.790 align:start position:0%
and the more and more we're being asked
to

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
operate with a full statewide response
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
not just a department of safety response
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so what this language does is um it
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
starts to build that
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
structure around our radio
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and looking at it
 
01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and looking at it
holistically

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
holistically
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging that it's a statewide
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
system with a statewide response
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
with different needs at the department
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
levels but
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
we should probably look at the system
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure itself
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
as a whole and and this would create um
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
would would create an opportunity for
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
911 the division of emergency services
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
and communications
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
to work with these other divisions and
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
other departments across the state
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
um to to identify ways that we can
 
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
um to to identify ways that we can
collaborate

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
collaborate
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
and um and and be smart about
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
the investments we make within our radio
 
01:24:54.159 --> 01:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
the investments we make within our radio
infrastructure

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have the biggest and broadest impact
 
01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
to have the biggest and broadest impact
possible

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
and not build a small network um to
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
service one department
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
um which inadvertently walled off of
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
benefits that could be achieved from
 
01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
benefits that could be achieved from
others

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i probably i turned over to the
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner to add add any other
 
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
commissioner to add add any other
information

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
that he wants to share about the
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
importance of this because it's
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
something that we've been talking about
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
um and it's certainly it's it's
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh um
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the right way to go so so
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'll just add in
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
in two minutes um in
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
2014 i was the colonel and i was
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
involved with a performance audit
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
of uh state department safety statewide
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
radio interoperability i have the lba
 
01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
radio interoperability i have the lba
report

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
here now and having gone through each
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
um long short um there was
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
some great recommendations here on you
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
know what's the long-term planning
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
what's the consolidation i think there
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
was a belief that department of safety
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
managed this you know super you know
 
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.149 align:start position:0%
managed this you know super you know
system

01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
of radio interoperability but as the
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
audit points out there are so many
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
separate and unique systems and so the
 
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
separate and unique systems and so the
recommendations

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just read one line the state did
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
not have a viable integrated strategic
 
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.590 align:start position:0%
not have a viable integrated strategic
radio

01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
radio
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
interoperability plan to provide clear
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
defining the desired end state for
 
01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:19.270 align:start position:0%
defining the desired end state for
interoperability

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
interoperability
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
since 2014 over the last you know uh
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
six six plus years we've made some
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
significant advancements
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
at uh desc and um this piece here
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
essentially ensures that similar to like
 
01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:34.709 align:start position:0%
essentially ensures that similar to like
i.t

01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
i.t
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
oversight and governance making sure
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
agencies when we're making these
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
purchases large purchases
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's a process so that they are
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
interoperability there's not a redundant
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
purchase and i know that
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
director doyle mark doyle and his team
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with other
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
leaders in state government looking at
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
some um whether it's capital projects
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
and do we really need this
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
are there areas where we can combine
 
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.350 align:start position:0%
are there areas where we can combine
consolidate

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and um so we have continued to look at
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
this performance audit the
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.390 align:start position:0%
this performance audit the
recommendations

01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
and i think we've made some advancements
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
and this this is a piece here that will
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know uh in short where the purchases
 
01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:14.310 align:start position:0%
you know uh in short where the purchases
are

01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
are are needed and necessary for
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
interoperability and there's no
 
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
interoperability and there's no
redundant

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh system or equipment in place
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
now so but yeah so yeah there's
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
there is i have i do have this question
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the department
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
shall annually review and set dollar
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
or other limit limits for purchases and
 
01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:44.310 align:start position:0%
or other limit limits for purchases and
contracts

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that the director of the division
 
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.790 align:start position:0%
and that the director of the division
emergency

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
management before
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
this now requires you
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
to review all of the um
 
01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.669 align:start position:0%
to review all of the um
[Music]

01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
and um i you know what one could
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
interpret this to say
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
since you're setting the dollar limits
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
then you are fun
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm i'm just a little concerned
 
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm i'm just a little concerned
about

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think i think
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
madame jimmy oh um
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
again i'm gonna ask my same question it
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
would seem like
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
this um system
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
um would fall into maybe something that
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
could be utilized for certainly um when
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
911 and and then we have emergencies
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
or nationally this would seem to be
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
something that would be an asset to that
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
because it would upgrade the system and
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
just have people talking to
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
each other more simultaneously
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
so could this be a federally funded
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
event or initiative
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
so i think if it needs to be if if the
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously if there was the
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
use was eligible
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
for those funds then then yeah it could
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
be what what i think this is true this
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
language is trying to do
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
is is really allow the agencies
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
to have um uh to be part
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the development and the use of the
 
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
of the development and the use of the
infrastructure

01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
around radio um and and bring those
 
01:29:44.719 --> 01:29:45.189 align:start position:0%
around radio um and and bring those
needs

01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
forward but have a have a statewide
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
level of review that makes sure that
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're going in a direction that
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
continues to be interoperable with our
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
other systems and so the funding is
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
is not really addressed because i
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
believe the intention is the funding
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
remains with that state agency
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and and that's where the contracts
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
language comes in and i can see the
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
confusion there because it almost seems
 
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.030 align:start position:0%
confusion there because it almost seems
like

01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're limiting we're saying well you
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
can't spend more than two million
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
dollars on your system
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that that's necessarily
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
the um intent it but but
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
i but i'm not 100 certain my
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
interpretation is
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
it would encourage a discussion to have
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
with the agency and
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
desk because if desk is having these
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
discussions with all agencies
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
maybe agency a says we want to replace
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
all of our radios
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
at two million dollars however agencies
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
b c and d
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
are planning to do a large replacement
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
next year and we can get some synergy by
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
combining those requests
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and so that would be an indication of
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
well we want to limit
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
your ability to purchase those now
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
because this is happening in six months
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so let's add you to this request
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
instead um
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that that would be the way that i'm
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
that that i that i read it
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you the other efficiencies would
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
may take an antenna anywhere in the
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
state they're going to be several state
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
agencies that have equipment on that
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
do we have multiple contracts do we have
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
multiple maintenance
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
agreements do we have i mean they're
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
just we looked at we broke down
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
this entire system to look and see who
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
has what where
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and again we're very sensitive that we
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
take this over but to ensure that you
 
01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:27.189 align:start position:0%
take this over but to ensure that you
know

01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we unders you know that they
 
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.229 align:start position:0%
that we unders you know that they
understand

01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
and this is similar to language that it
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
has for it
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know purchases that's that's where
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
we looked to make sure that
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
the right decisions are being made the
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
equipment's interoperable and
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know that we're not um paying more
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
than we should for
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
something and that we actually need the
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
equipment so
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it's
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
it shows good you know fiscal
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility and i think at the end of
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
um the more that these agencies work
 
01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
um the more that these agencies work
together

01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
i can tell you um
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
director stewart from um cultural
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
resources has worked very closely with
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh emergency communications team
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
and they have already shared um made
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
significant savings with you know
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
purchases that didn't need to be made
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're working on you know you know
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
having them do the do the
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the upgrades to some of
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
the systems because
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're already there they're already
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
going there so the more you talk the
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
more you
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know you see where efficiencies can
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
be done but again i know you've got a
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
lot of reading to do
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
but if you look back to this performance
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
audit that was done in 2014
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
there are some things here that um
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
spot on and we've been kind of chipping
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
and chipping away at them
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know little by little but back to
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
the state has made significant uh
 
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
the state has made significant uh
capital

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh improvements to the radio system over
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
the past six years and
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
right now thankfully it's in a it's in a
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
good place
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
we want to continue that moving forward
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounds like it's um a real
 
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounds like it's um a real
move

01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
to reduce redundancy and could save
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:29.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
let's move on to the next area
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there is a next area i
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
think that that actually concludes
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
the direct house bill 2 sections for the
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay did this capital appropriation
 
01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.270 align:start position:0%
okay did this capital appropriation
repurposing

01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
repurposing
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
go away yeah that that found its way
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
into house bill 25 where
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
um more appropriately so because it
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
affected the capital appropriations
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh is there anything
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
that you would like to see in
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
hb2 that's not there besides
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
the unfunded position
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
um that's the only piece uh at this
 
01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.510 align:start position:0%
um that's the only piece uh at this
point

01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
um i i i think we're i think we're good
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
there there's probably one other piece
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
there should be one other piece related
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
to moving the mechanical licensing board
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
over to oplc um that's standard
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
language just changing who where that
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
function resides um so at this time i
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's anything else that
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
we would be requesting in hb2
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh just that was unfunded position
 
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.790 align:start position:0%
uh just that was unfunded position
authority

01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
steve can i can i just show you i'm
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to share my screen one more time
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
i've got the hhs section that does that
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
so so right here
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
is i think what we were talking about
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at that
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
so would your request essentially be to
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
be added to that section or have similar
 
01:35:11.199 --> 01:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
be added to that section or have similar
section

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's on on first
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
on first gloss that looks like that's
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
the language that we would be requesting
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay yep thanks mickey yep
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
so that's section 21 uh for for the
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
committee if you want to take a note to
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
look at another time
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh we could um put an amendment in maybe
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
keep it separate so we don't
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
interact with division three section of
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing this for hhs
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
add a new section for safety or a men's
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
section 144 relative to their transfer
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
authority and have
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay and you folks have no
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
problem with the transfer of the uh
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical safety thing is that correct
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we can can tell division one go
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
yep okay
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i will make a note of that
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
so mechanical yeah all right i
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
by the way i think we we we agree
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
um and we worked closely the fire
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
marshal worked closely with um
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney over at oplc we met
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
several times and to coordinate
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
and it it makes a lot of sense
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes state government is
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's so many different functions we
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
have things
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
things end up getting in places where
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily belong
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
and um when we can fix them we want to
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
fix them and that
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is a move that's uh that makes a
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay i believe uh that we have you back
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
next week one day i'm sorry i don't
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
remember which day it was
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh where we will be going through your
 
01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh where we will be going through your
budget

01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
kind of on what we call a line-by-line
 
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.669 align:start position:0%
kind of on what we call a line-by-line
basis

01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
for the um division to
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh ask whatever questions they might
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
have on uh
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the funding what what you're looking
 
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.669 align:start position:0%
on the funding what what you're looking
for

01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um i'm sure that
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
you saw what came out of
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
um ways and means and their
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
and their funding levels so um
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll work through all of that
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously we won't be making any
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
final decisions next week but it
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
certainly will give
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to uh
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
to see where we are absolutely no we
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
will we'll be happy to go through at
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
that level of detail
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
and at that time we'll also bring
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
forward some
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
um technical corrections for on for the
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee to review
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
things like a change in a a revenue
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
source that doesn't
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a a net impact but would make it
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
correct due to a keying error little
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
small things like that for consideration
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're muted representative
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i know mickey's looking
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
forward to making all of those
 
01:38:52.719 --> 01:38:54.950 align:start position:0%
forward to making all of those
adjustments

01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
that'll uh that'll get him uh that'll
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
get him started
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
as as opposed to uh
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
where we are right now so yeah okay
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
and um for the
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
division today's thursday uh
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we uh we get to talk to
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh d.o.t
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
and um we'll uh
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see what uh what they have to
 
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.070 align:start position:0%
we'll see what uh what they have to
offer

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
and obviously they will probably have to
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:32.310 align:start position:0%
and obviously they will probably have to
offer

01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
um offer up uh some safety positions
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
to uh to unfund some safety positions so
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
we'll look at all of that tomorrow and
 
01:39:46.639 --> 01:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
we'll look at all of that tomorrow and
uh

01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
and see exactly what they have now
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
they did i think you all got the package
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
from d.o.t and i know
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
that they tend to
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
refer us to um you know to that
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
so please make sure that on your um
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
on your dining room table like mine
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh or wherever that
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
that that is uh that is available so i
 
01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
that that is uh that is available so i
guess

01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
i will see you all tomorrow morning at
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock right thanks everybody
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
