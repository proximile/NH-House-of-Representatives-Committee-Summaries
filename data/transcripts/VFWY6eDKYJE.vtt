00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
committee uh Philip Trowbridge is away
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
from Des today so he asked me to report
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
on HB 1312. Mr Pelletier is with us in
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
between us and others in the room we
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
should be able to answer any questions
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
so as most of you know over the summer
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee was formed that met
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
in person twice and was significant and
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
I mean a lot of additional
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
Communications and reviews between the
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
parties we generated the report that
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
you've seen the committee consisted of
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
Representatives of nhdes the bcrb DHHS
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal's office and the
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire building officials
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
Association and we appreciate the input
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
from representative Schmidt and McGuire
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
who attended some of the meetings
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh you'll recall that in addressing
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
questions as to the required size of
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
grease interceptors HB 1312 also
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in a conflict with RSA 155a to
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
X which prohibits state agencies from
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
amending the building code so we tried
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
to deal with both of those issues the
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
factual basis and a summary of the
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts the the issues that that come
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
up on the table are laid out in the
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
report I'll summarize the action steps
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
that came out of the exercise here which
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
are we get into in more detail in the
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
report so there are nine steps that we
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
all agreed on one would be to to amend
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
the international plumbing code our
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
plumbing code definition of building
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
sewer such that the IPC would not
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
regulate piping and equipment from just
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
outside the building to the septic or
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
sewer system as discussions have gone on
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that may be narrowly tailored down to
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
deal just with septic which is what DEA
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes regulates
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would leave Des regulating what we
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
call the building sewer the pipe from
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
the building to the septic tank
 
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:22.220 align:start position:0%
and Municipal agencies
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
regulating their own systems
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
as we get into the wording that has
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
tentacles that go to unforeseen
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
locations so that will get worked out
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the interaction between
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
the code and Des
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
we've basically taken the code or
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
proposed to take the code out of that
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
element for septic tank pipes and leave
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
primarily but not only because half the
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
towns in the state have no building
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
inspector so nobody thinks that Des
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be looking at this stuff
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
we would also amend the IPC such that if
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
an interior or hydromechanical separator
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
is the only separator provided Des
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
approval would be required in addition
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
to the plumbing code
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
we'd address the IPC to address a
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
technical issue with drainage from
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
certain restaurant sinks when
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
hydromechanical interceptors are used
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
that just gets into when you need an
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
indirect train and a direct train and it
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
was sort of a sub issue that came out of
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
Des would amend their rules to
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
explicitly permit interior Hydro
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
mechanical separators for certain small
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
occupancies and the listing of the
 
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:36.500 align:start position:0%
conditions for that are in the report
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
these are occupancies where currently
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
this approach is normally permitted by
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
waiver they would write that into the
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
rule so it would be permitted by right
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
Des would also amend their rules to more
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
explicitly address Greece interceptors
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
in the waiver program so you don't have
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
to sort of know what's going on before
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
you get into this they would also amend
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
their rules to permit a minimum 500
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
gallon size for exterior gravity type
 
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:05.540 align:start position:0%
interceptors but retain the current
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
36-hour detention time
 
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
that argument and the defense of that is
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the report and I believe that the
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
folks with us today can get into it in
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
more detail if if needed
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
Des will review various reference
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
standards in their rules and in the IPC
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
so there are standards written by others
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
on how to build a gravity tank a
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
reference different standards and try
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
and bring those together so we would
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
either amend one set of rules or the
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
other so that they would both say the
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
same thing ideally
 
00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:40.449 align:start position:0%
same thing ideally
um

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:40.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
nhdes that building officials
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
Association and the mechanical licensing
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
board will work together to improve
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
training and education on all this stuff
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
so when this hits the road out in the
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
field people read the same language come
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
up with different opinions and through
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
the training and education try and get a
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
more standardized approach to what's
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
going on and then obviously both the Des
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
rules and the bcrb through the
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
ratification process need to go through
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the standard channels to uh to update
 
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.590 align:start position:0%
the standard channels to uh to update
things

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
the result of this exercise is to
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate the conflict between the
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
various regulations and to provide
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
changes to Des rules that will benefit
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain small users based on the
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
proposed action steps we do not believe
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
that legislative action is required but
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
that we can handle it through the the
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
bcrb Amendments and the nhdes rule
 
00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:37.010 align:start position:0%
bcrb Amendments and the nhdes rule
process

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer questions I
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
can answer or turn it over to Des for
 
00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:44.179 align:start position:0%
anything on their side
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to thank you and
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
everybody else who was involved in this
 
00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:52.370 align:start position:0%
everybody else who was involved in this
effort

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
for what you've done I think
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
at least I believe that this is you know
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
it will eliminate some confusion and
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
provide flexibility for small businesses
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
which is good does anybody have
 
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
which is good does anybody have
questions

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.490 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh and I'm
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
personally very grateful to the people
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
involved and many of whom are here today
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
for the very hard work that it was put
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
in by all of you uh and this in this
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
working group representative Aaron I I
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you were aware of the
 
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:34.940 align:start position:0%
fact that this was happening at the time
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
you weren't able to make uh either uh
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
the two meetings but I can assure you
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
having participated in both of them
 
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:46.340 align:start position:0%
um that that there was a very
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
significant amount of of expertise
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
involved and experience on the part of
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
the people who were there and we kicked
 
00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:57.620 align:start position:0%
around a lot of stuff I recall Mr
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
Ted Evans who was there I think he was
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
the one that said you know we've never
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
had a meeting like this before
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
and I think that the fact that this
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
group did come together is Indica of the
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
not only the willingness to address the
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
situation but the recognition on the
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
part of the parties involved that that
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
this is a real issue and the fact that
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh that you're one of your conclusions
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Sherman is that legislation will not
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
be required but my question and my first
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
um is this going to uh the various
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
different concepts and adjustments that
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
you've just addressed at least briefly
 
00:19:47.529 --> 00:19:47.539 align:start position:0%
in your opening remarks
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
whether this has uh developed a maturity
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
if you will that is sufficient so that
 
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:00.380 align:start position:0%
the various different state agencies and
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh and non-state agency actors uh are
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
already proceeding to create the
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
necessary the interaction of steps that
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
need to be made in order that you spoke
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
of training and so forth so is this all
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
currently happening is it going to have
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
to be triggered by something how are we
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to proceed so that that we both
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate the recognitions that grew
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
out of this working group but also
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
address the situation
 
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
that you also referenced into your
 
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380 align:start position:0%
remarks namely that many of the entities
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
small towns do not have the necessary
 
00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:50.539 align:start position:0%
authorities in place to make sure that
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
businesses such as the one that
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
triggered representative Aaron's
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
um bill that they are sufficiently
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
informed so we don't have this kind of a
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
situation proceeding further uh I know
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad question but please
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
approach it and address it as you will
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps des and nhpoa could
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
could respond to the training and
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
education function better than I we have
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
no no statutory involvement in that
 
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.169 align:start position:0%
no no statutory involvement in that
ourselves

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and answer your question all of this is
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
where we are today everybody's coming up
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
for air after the summer of course uh so
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
I suspect that much of this would be uh
 
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
proceeding in the next few months
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
um and the rule making and the amendment
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
process takes x amount of time there's
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
no question about that so I I don't know
 
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
if Bill or or Randy you have anything to
 
00:21:53.529 --> 00:21:53.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman well Mr Pelletier
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
is coming up uh I spoke with Ted deers
 
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.970 align:start position:0%
is coming up uh I spoke with Ted deers
of

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure whether he's with Des or
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
HHS but I spoke with him yesterday and
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
he said that there had been further many
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
further discussions resulting from the
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
working group which Mr Sherman was
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
president Mr McKinney the fire marshal
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
Mitchell was there uh and
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
um other other parties it was already an
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
excellent group of knowledgeable people
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
so where where are we rainy with the
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
situation yeah for the record rainy
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
Pelletier I'm the director of The Water
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
Division at DES and representative
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
Schmidt Ted Diaz is the assistant
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division so we're
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
all in Phil
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
we all work together as a group but I
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
think our initial intent is we do have
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
rule waiver capability but I think the
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
the hand the task at hand is the
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
educational process it's where
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
initially we're going to put a fact
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
sheet out we have it if you've ever been
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the Des website you'll see that for a
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
Litany of issues we have fact sheets to
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
kind of help people uh understand
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
whatever the topic may be whether it's
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
water quality whether it's something in
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
drinking water or whatever but uh intent
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
is is to do a fact sheet on Greece to
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
try and explain the issues we work hand
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
in hand with HH and S the food licensing
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
program I would certainly share that
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
fact sheet with them as well
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I I think now that we've kind of as
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
a group
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
um which I did not participate in but
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
Phil Trowbridge as you know did he's the
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
land resource manager at DES
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
and I think we're all on the same page I
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
think in the early goings until as you
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
know representative Schmidt takes
 
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
know representative Schmidt takes
uh

00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
six to seven eight months maybe to get a
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
rule making pack package done and
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
through j.oka but I think in the interim
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to waive the tank
 
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.649 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to waive the tank
issue

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
um and as you know I think it's
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
a process of educating our staff so when
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
our inspectors go out we're not having
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
the issue that happened in in Goshen so
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
I think we've got a good handle on it I
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
think everybody's on the same page
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
and I see it
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward I think relatively
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
smoothly and I think if we get a problem
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
where there's uh negative interaction
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
which I I can assure you I will make
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
sure our staff are all educated on where
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
we're going with this
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see that as a problem but
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think we we're wide open to getting
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
people through the process and the
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
interim and then have it very definitive
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
in our rules package so someone can pick
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
up the document understand when a wave
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
is available how you get a waiver and
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
move forward so I think we've come to a
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
good conclusion and and I I don't think
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
the situation that arose that
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron brought to our
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
attention will happen again
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
um I just I think
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
we've all educated ourselves so I think
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
there should be a not an issue thank you
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
um when the fact sheet comes out could
 
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
you please send it to the committee I
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of course we'll
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
distributed well I was saying the whole
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
Edna committee is probably the easiest
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
thing to do and everybody will get one
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
um representative fellows
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I I could be wrong and representative
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
Aaron can correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
when we first had the hearing public
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
hearing about this bill
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
my understanding was what triggered the
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
the requirement for the grease trap was
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
not ice cream it was had to do with the
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
fryers fryers were added so but
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um as we went through the discussion we
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
kind of came to the conclusion that
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
really the ice cream hard ice cream was
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
more of an issue than the fryers
 
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
more of an issue than the fryers
so

00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:27.169 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
my question is when this establishment
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
first got approval from HHS
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
that nobody questioned the hard ice
 
00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:39.230 align:start position:0%
that nobody questioned the hard ice
cream

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
cream
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
um in terms of grandfathering if there
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
are other establishments out there that
 
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:49.820 align:start position:0%
have had the hard ice cream all along
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
are these rules these rules will will
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
put them out of compliance possibly but
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
will they be grandfathered is that a
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
standard process or do you need to
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
identify that well I think what we would
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
make an attempt to do is considering
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
where we've all come through an
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
agreement to entertain the concept of
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
hydro mechanical in the building
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
treatment which are not big ticket items
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
like a thousand gallon tank or a 500
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
gallon tank but at the end of the day
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
when you think about an establishment
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's getting rid of its Wastewater on
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
site vis-a-vis septic system then in
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
fact they put their self at risk so
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
number one I would hope we would do a
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
good job of educating them about the
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
ramifications of not handling that
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
wasteload and number two they'd have the
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
ability to purchase an in-house
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
track so I think the grandfather in
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
question that you ask I think once these
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
people get an opportunity to be educated
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
about the risk associated you know
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
nowadays we're seeing especially since
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
the pandemic that the average septic
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
system depending on the side it's twenty
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
you know so if people get in a situation
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
where the system fails it's going to be
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
a lot more cost effective to spend 500
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever on a grease trap so our
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
first attempt would be to try and
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
educate and not regulate
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
um I think at DES we try and do that in
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
all venues and all media that we deal
 
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.590 align:start position:0%
all venues and all media that we deal
with

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think grandfathering makes
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense just because of the end
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
result that could happen but I'm not
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure that there's a lot of the
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
situations that you're talking about in
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
every situation is different so I think
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
they were first we'd start with having
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
an open conversation about you know
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
how you doing what are you doing
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
um but it it may very well be once we
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
make them aware of the risk that we may
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
in fact grandfather depending on the
 
00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:56.750 align:start position:0%
in fact grandfather depending on the
facility

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know the type of use but I think it
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
it benefits everyone to be educated on
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications are of what kind
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
of Wastewater they're discharging if
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
they obviously have an on-site septic
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
system and and then see how that
 
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
dialogue goes okay thank you
 
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I I understand and I agree that in
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
principle it's much better to try to
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
educate them and and to try to have them
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
make a modification that wouldn't be
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
terribly expensive but isn't it I know
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
that just septic tanks
 
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
that are in place I I know about homes I
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't really know about businesses but
 
00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
you get grandfathered so you know my
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
septic tank was put in like 40 years ago
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
and for a house and it would if you were
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
building the same house today they'd
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
tell me to get a bigger one yep
 
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.450 align:start position:0%
tell me to get a bigger one yep
um

00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
am concerned that
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
there could be people out there and I
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
don't want them they didn't do anything
 
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.100 align:start position:0%
wrong when they set it up
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't they wouldn't get a
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
fine or or being told they couldn't
 
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.630 align:start position:0%
fine or or being told they couldn't
operate

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
because of the changes we're making here
 
00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
today right and I think first and
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
foremost assuming that they have a
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
state-approved septic system and they
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
came in
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
unlike the situation we dealt with that
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
representative Barron was dealing with
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
if they came in to us we'd granted a
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
construction approval to install a
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
septic system for an ice cream shack 10
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
years ago or 12 years ago that's a legal
 
00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
years ago or 12 years ago that's a legal
system

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
so what we would do is we would try and
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
educate them and say the benefits but I
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we would be in there with
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
blazing guns saying you got to put a
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
grease trap in we've already approved it
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't consider that a
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
grandfathering I would consider it a
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
state approved septic system for a
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
particular wastelode discharge and if
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
that permit that we approved was for an
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
ice cream stand and they're legal so
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
um if I could ask a question that might
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
clarify this so correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is there's nothing
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
in the proposed rule changes
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
that would be more restrictive than what
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
exists today
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
is that correct no what it does is it
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
opens up more options of what's
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
available so if something is legal and
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
was granted a permit today nothing in
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
this would revoke that nope okay thank
 
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.690 align:start position:0%
this would revoke that nope okay thank
you

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your question
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
because the one thing that I I think we
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
all would be concerned about is if we
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
say well the this educational process
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
that you're both speaking about
 
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
um and I imagine that you're in the
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
process or will shortly be in the
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
process of generating some bulletins and
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh and other educational materials for
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
your inspectors and for the general
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
public for contractors plumbers and so
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
forth so the word will go out you know
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
as it has in human history with things
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
like washing hands before operating on
 
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
um you know people
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
I could go on for hours about that topic
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
but the thing is that we do we don't
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
step aside from from legislative steps
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
as you're recommending without some firm
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Departments the
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
agencies and so forth are going to be
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
following up very quickly and that there
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
will be something that will cross our
 
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.669 align:start position:0%
will be something that will cross our
desks

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
desks
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
in the fullness of time hopefully not
 
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:12.260 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
that will make sure that we that we're
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
getting this done
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm wondering the the the people
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
that triggered
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Aaron's bill
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
um they wound up having to bite the
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
bullet on a ten thousand on a thousand
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
gallon uh grease trap
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh now they're well protected in the
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
future and almost no matter what they do
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
but how many other businesses are
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
protect potentially in Jeopardy of
 
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.250 align:start position:0%
protect potentially in Jeopardy of
having

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:49.370 align:start position:0%
this kind of
um

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
it was not overreach it was a
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I think of you know
 
00:33:56.889 --> 00:33:56.899 align:start position:0%
what all the aspects were
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
given the discussion that this working
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
group had a lot of
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know you can't get here there from
 
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
you know you can't get here there from
here

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh and the net effect was that this
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
particular business and potentially
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
other businesses are also in Jeopardy of
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
being misinformed or maybe uh having to
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
Pony up a lot more money than they they
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
should have so what what can what can we
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
hear here uh to make sure that this is
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
going forward well I think the
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
difference situation is when I was asked
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
the earlier question about the
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
grandfathering issue assuming that
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
whatever the facility is has a state
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
approved septic system for that use then
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
they're legal in perpetuity much like uh
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
you probably got a 750 gallon tank today
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
we require 1250s we don't go into houses
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
and say you got to rip your tank out and
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
put in a new one but if you came in
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
because your system failed then under
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
the new design criteria you'd be
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
required to use a 1250. but prior to
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
that illegal because you've got a
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
construction approval from us the
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
situation that raised this issue with
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron was quite different
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
they originally had an approval for an
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
ice cream check and there was a
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
significant change of use the difference
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
today though or in the future would be
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
there would this be this opportunity for
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
an Institute grease trap depending it
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
met the criteria for what you were going
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
to do with your waist charge and if you
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
look at the report there's three or four
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
issues that would give you availability
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
to that wave of situation so I think
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
that an issue in this particular case
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
they probably may not have needed a
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
thousand gallon tank so I think because
 
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
of the progress made by the committee
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
that type of scenario I would not
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
Envision happening again and I think
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
that would be addressed because of the
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
conclusions that were arrived at in this
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee so I think now we're
 
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
all on the same page so the issue is the
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
education part is the big part is
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
everything we do at DES and we strive
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
very hard to make that open
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
communication so we truly
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
philosophically would rather educate
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
than regulate I mean that is our
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal as an agency philosophy it
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
always has been as you know I've been
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
there my whole career and we try to work
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
very hard to get out of the regulatory
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
scheme if we can educate first so we're
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
not at odds with anyone so long and
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
short to that question is I don't
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
anticipate that what happened with
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron's issue would
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
happen again I think just because of the
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
conclusions of the report in the ad hoc
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
committee that would not happen you know
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
and I think the good thing about what
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
came out of the committee was there's
 
00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:01.460 align:start position:0%
going to be very definitive
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
items that rule you into the waiver
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
process so this is how you get it so
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's not done in a dark room how do we
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
figure out what the waiver is uh they'll
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
be the criteria listed be very clear my
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
staff has already been educated on this
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and so it won't be what do I do how
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
do I get a wave oh what makes me
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for a waiver so I think just in
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
three months we've come a long way in
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
trying to address the situation that
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
happened yeah I appreciate that and I
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
mean they've committed to doing certain
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
rulemaking it's in this report I expect
 
00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:41.579 align:start position:0%
that to happen and and to your concern I
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
mean ultimately for whatever reason it
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen there's always the option
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
for legislation in the future which
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can avoid
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
um what I'm
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
hoping to do is at some point we'll have
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
a motion to recommend not recommend for
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
and when I write the report or whoever
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
write support we can summarize you know
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so I'd like to ask
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
people on the committee or anybody else
 
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.770 align:start position:0%
people on the committee or anybody else
here

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
any any concerns that would about doing
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
that and if so you know do you have any
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
um this report or anything else that
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
would stand in the way of supporting a
 
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I agree with
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
everything you said the the only comment
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to make is that you know
 
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
represent representative Aaron obviously
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
brought this forward for a reason and is
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
as long as she is comfortable with
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
everything that we're hearing and um if
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
there's anything that she
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
that she would like to be either either
 
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.430 align:start position:0%
that she would like to be either either
done

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
with either not recommending or
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
recommending that would be
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
um what I would support is you know
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
basically whatever she says I think um
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron could you repeat
 
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:04.700 align:start position:0%
the comments you made
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
separately both about your views on this
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
and also the views of the business
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate all the work that
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
this committee and subcommittee and uh
 
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:23.060 align:start position:0%
you in DEA des and
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
hboa and bcrb have done to address this
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
issue and come up with a solution for it
 
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
I am internally grateful
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to my constituent about
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
this uh shared with him this report he
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
was more than pleased about
 
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.270 align:start position:0%
was more than pleased about
um

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
what was developed by this ad hoc
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to thank you and I
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
do have one or two questions though
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
um for the item number three where
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're amending the Des rules
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming those are all ands
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
instead of ores that every Everything a
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
b c and d and e and f all of those
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
conditions have to be met there's it's
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
not an it's an and
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's an and okay also when you
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
speak about Item B that there's no deep
 
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:24.980 align:start position:0%
fryer will there be some kind of
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
distinguishing factor between deep
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
fryers that are con self-contained where
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
Greece is trapped within them and can be
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
disposed in a recycling way versus ones
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.569 align:start position:0%
that are not
yes

00:40:43.569 --> 00:40:43.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
oh good to go yes yeah yeah no I would
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
think that the key is is if there's
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
something self-contained that can be
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
disposed of which is what item three in
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
the report talks about you have the
 
00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
availability to have that in set to a
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
grease strap but it's the ones that you
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
get out and many of the restaurant
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
facilities we have don't have that
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
luxury and the grease goes somewhere
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
right so it's going to be a situation
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
to add Clarity because you even raised
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
that question that would be something
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we'd want to put in the rule okay
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
and how how soon are the rules adopted
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
you said between six and eight months no
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
it takes that long and can't I'm going
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
to be candid with you I have a terrible
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
issue with Staffing you know and
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
subsurface I'm down five people we can't
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
attract anybody the outside economy is
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
paying far more than the state salaries
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
are paying so I will give it my best
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
attempt to try and get six or eight
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
months to get rules done on a good day
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is a six-month process by the
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
time you have public hearings you have
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
public input you get the rules drafted
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
you got to go to jail Caso at the very
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
minimum it would be at least a six-month
 
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:02.180 align:start position:0%
window but I think in the interim
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
because of the mentality and the
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
education that we've done in-house I
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't see that if it takes eight months
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
or no months I don't think the situation
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
that happened would happen because we
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
have all been educated on with the way
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to handle this stuff and
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
like I did say if I'm sitting here
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
telling you we're going to do rules
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to do rules right okay so
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that prior to any rule
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
change these this this policy is going
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
to be in effect yep okay great and one
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
other thing on on that question on the
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
prior part of it and again correct me if
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I think the business like
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
the one that raised this issue would
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
need a waiver but in number four part a
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
Roman one and two
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
it gets into
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if they're do if they're
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
putting minimal grease down the system
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
then they could get the waiver and not
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
be required uh the tank that you know
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
external tank well so then Mr chair with
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
that being said I am certainly
 
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.410 align:start position:0%
that being said I am certainly
um

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
very happy with the result of this and I
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
would concur with the committee uh
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
recommending no further legislative
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
action in in lieu of these rules being
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
adopted and uh in the interim being
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
adopted as well thank you any other
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
um I had that same question but my other
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
question would be does it make sense for
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
us to kind of put in a pla recommend a
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
placeholder bill
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
um because of the fact that
 
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.069 align:start position:0%
um because of the fact that
that

00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
um that there could be modifications to
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
the two to the plumbing code and well I
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
given the schedule and the legislative
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
schedule and that you know if we were to
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
put in an LSR now
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
it would have to have public hearings
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
sometime before they'd be able to do
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so I don't see that as useful
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're concerned that
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
something happens and the rulemaking
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know until after our
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislative next year and that would
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
have to happen the following year
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
right so I don't think that would work
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I can assure you I sit here and I
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
tell you we're going to do rules we are
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to do it I'm not disbelieving you
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
placeholder bills are really uh they
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
they don't accept placeholder bills
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
anymore you have to have a real bill
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
right and so it would have to it would
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
have to go you know we would end up
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
hearing it before the full committee and
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
we'd probably have to itl it because
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
things would be in an unknown state so
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't make any sense any other
 
00:44:45.359 --> 00:44:47.870 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't make any sense any other
questions

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're good
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
um would somebody like to make a motion
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
or I can
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you I'll do it I know you're
 
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.569 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you I'll do it I know you're
not

00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:10.490 align:start position:0%
 
silent

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
silent
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
oh certainly
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
um I move that uh that we uh that this
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
not rec we not recommend for future
 
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.609 align:start position:0%
not rec we not recommend for future
legislation

00:45:21.609 --> 00:45:21.619 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
so a second a second oh well that okay
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
either one I second that motion okay
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine and so um we'll take a vote
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
I vote uh well actually I'm last so
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
um yes and representative Rhodes yes
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
and uh terrebotes yes so that's what
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
 
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.470 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
um

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
so I will write a just a summary of this
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
because it has to go in the calendar
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
explaining why we're okay with no
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
further regular um legislation and um
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
I think we're done thank you thank you
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
everybody especially thanks for all the
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
folks that put work in on this I really
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so often interim study is
 
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.069 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so often interim study is
uh

00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes not taken seriously sort of a
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
soft kill but in this case it was
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually very valuable and I thank
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
everybody who made that happen so
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
and represent fellows I I would like to
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
second that you know as a retired state
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
employee and understanding the Staffing
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
shortages during covet I really
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the demand that we have
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
put on you and that you came and met
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're done
