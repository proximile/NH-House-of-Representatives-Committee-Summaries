foreign
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
to everybody uh on the committee and
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
those and the public that are attending
 
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
this uh uh hearing on 5 21 before we get
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
into 5 21 just several announcements for
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
the the committee
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we will be hearing this bill first
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
today but following this bill there we
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
will break into a caucuses and so we
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
will be starting the exact sessions up
 
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
following the caucuses uh in that the
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
cauces I'm sure will last a good half
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
hour maybe a little bit longer uh so
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
that um for the public that you you
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
don't have to sit through and wait you
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
can go wander the halls or whatever
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd like to open up this
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
hearing 4 5 21. this is a bill relative
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education payment
 
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
for placement for an episode of
 
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.529 align:start position:0%
for placement for an episode of
treatment

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
um welcome representative Leon
 
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
the education committee for the record I
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
am representative Erica Leon of Derry
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
and I'm delighted to be back in front of
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
this committee uh with my experience
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
serving on this committee now in health
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
and human services and being on my
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
physical Advisory board for my school
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
district one of the areas that I have of
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
interest is to find where we're making
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers pay for health care and
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
get that out of the local taxpayers
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
obligation and get it to the state
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
getting it to the Department of Health
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
and Human Services or whichever bucket
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
is the correct one because local tax
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
school rate taxpayers should not be
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
paying for the health care of those
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
students the department came to me with
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
this bill because there is a current
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
issue with the system of care we
 
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
actually have as I'm sure you're all
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
aware we have an issue with boarding's
 
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780 align:start position:0%
children who are going through
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
troubling mental times possibly suicidal
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
and they're being boarded in hospitals
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
on their way to to a placement there is
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
current there's an existing system where
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
with a court ordered placement they
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
could be placed into a facility and that
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be paid for by this Department of
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
Education there is a new voluntary
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
program that was recently created but
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's no funding mechanism for that
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
expense to be paid by the department and
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's currently born by local taxpayers
 
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would address that issue
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and I'm delighted that I can have any
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
small role in this I don't actually
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
understand all of the full details so I
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
will turn that over to Rebecca Fredette
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
the state director of special education
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
services but I hope that you'll look at
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
this as one of the potential Solutions
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
of untangling that mix between health
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
care and education and sending the bill
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
where it really truly deserves to go
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent Leon
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I know you have to be out of you very
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
quickly I do too and I know represent
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
Miler is already probably no he's not
 
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
represent Lunas out of here and instead
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
I have a question have you been in
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
contact with the department so you can
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
get a better understanding of what kind
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
of fiscal Impact Physical note this is
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
going to result in it I know there
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
it says right here for this bill has to
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
introduced at this time when complete
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note will be available have
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
you had any approximations of what type
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
of dollars we're talking about here
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you I don't have those dollars
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
right now that's something that I can
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
get back to you before you have this
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled for an executive session these
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
same students if they went through the
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
the more time intensive process for a
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
court ordered placement would end up
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
being paid by the department
 
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.829 align:start position:0%
being paid by the department
um

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
the question is do we through voluntary
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
agreement do we get this treatment
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
sooner or do we make them go through
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
this process thank you
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
um if I'm looking at this correctly the
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
two agencies involved DHHS and doe
 
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.250 align:start position:0%
two agencies involved DHHS and doe
um

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:45.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
DHHS would be involved in terms of the
 
00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.710 align:start position:0%
DHHS would be involved in terms of the
costs

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
if it was the child was other than a
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
special needs child if it is a special
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
needs child then the cost would be
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
covered by the Department of Education
 
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
is that understanding correct
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
possibly I think that'd be a better
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
question for the director of specials
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
Education Services thank you for the
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
but that I'm also going to be leaving
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to represent cordelli will
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
take over the meeting do we have any
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
other cards on this one we have
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
so Department of Education Rebecca
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you representative
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
Vlad and the committee my name is uh
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Fredette I'm the state director
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
of special education
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
we've asked for the change in RSA 193 27
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
to add the definition of an episode of
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
treatment and in RSA 186 c18 I believe
 
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.380 align:start position:0%
you have my statement in front of you
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
and then it does have an attachment
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
which is technical assistance that we
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
provide to the districts regarding
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
um this exact thing we're going to talk
 
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.009 align:start position:0%
um this exact thing we're going to talk
about

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
um an episode of treatment as defined by
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
our proposal is when a child needs to be
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
placed at the by the Department of
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services in a DHHS
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
contracted and or certified program to
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
receive more intensive treatment and
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
supports and has the objective of
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
helping children in crisis avoid or
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
reduce the use of psychiatric hospitals
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
and emergency rooms these their these
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
placements are determined through dhhs's
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
integrated system called the system of
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
care it's been developed in the last few
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
years some of you may be
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
um familiar with it and specifically the
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
fast forward program while these
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
determinations are made in the best
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
sense of interest of the child they are
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
not considered an IEP team placement and
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
therefore our district is not able to
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
access their idea funds to support the
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
placement nor have they budgeted for
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
these placements
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
this is very similar to our current RSA
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
186 c19b whereby the state provides Aid
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
through our court ordered placement
 
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
funds within this fund once the district
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
has paid three times the estimated State
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
average expenditure per child
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
all expenses beyond that will be covered
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
by the court ordered placement funds
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
these cop funds currently cover children
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
in placement for which the Department of
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has the
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
in this past year there have been 50
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
Children placed through this system of
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
care districts have struggled with this
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
process as it is outside the idea
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
process and is not part of an IEP team
 
00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:35.449 align:start position:0%
process and is not part of an IEP team
decision

00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
where the educational decisions are made
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
regarding the needs of the child
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
educationally the current expectation is
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that this number will increase Over time
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
however it is also expected that the
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
number of court ordered placements will
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
decrease moving forward and I forgot the
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
words will decrease on the on this while
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
you are while we are supportive of the
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
necessity for the system of care and the
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
decisions made in the best interests of
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
children we would ask that this RSA be
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
changed to support these placements as
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
we do our court ordered placements
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions from the
 
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.930 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions from the
committee

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Damon
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning thank
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
could you just explain why these
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
placements are not part of this standard
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
IEP process so
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
um you can only place a child if the IEP
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
team has determined that this is
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their educational needs
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
so you may have a child that is goes to
 
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
school and is fine they have their IEP
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
implemented they the district has never
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
thought of placing them somewhere else
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue there and then because
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
of their issues at home or mental health
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
issues they do get placed in one of
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
these facilities well we CA it wasn't
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
based on a need for their disability it
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
was based on another need and so we're
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
not able to pay for that placement
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
through that the team are what we have
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
suggested in the technical assistance is
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that IEP team convene and discuss
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
the placement and say is this a
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
placement we would have placed this
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
child based on their needs within our
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
facility if they determine that it isn't
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
they cannot pay for it with their Ida
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
funds or their special education funds
 
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.889 align:start position:0%
funds or their special education funds
foreign

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
there are times I will clarify though
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
that there are times that
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe the child has been having
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
difficulty in school and they just
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to the point where
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to place them and so there
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
are occasions where the district will
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
say we were headed in this direction
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
anyway so yes we agree and we will start
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
to pay for this but all of that would be
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
at their own cost it would not be part
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
of a court order placement payment that
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
we provide to them as part of that
 
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.449 align:start position:0%
we provide to them as part of that
process

00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
being here could you please define other
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
needs that would be beyond the idea
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
so what kinds of things would have been
 
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.689 align:start position:0%
so what kinds of things would have been
sure

00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if my uh my colleague
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ross from DHHS can Define this
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
much better but I will give you the
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
information I know I don't believe she
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
um was able to attend today so there are
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
times when a child may be suicidal or
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
they may be violent at home and they're
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
a threat to their family but they may
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
not have
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
um this going on at schools because we
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
need to focus on what the educational
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
portion which is what Ida says you look
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
at how is this impacting them
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
educationally they may be doing fine
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
they may be going home and saying I want
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
to kill myself I you know unfortunately
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
not a good thing but they may be saying
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that or they may be violent towards
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
their siblings and the family needs
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
assistance so they reach out to the um
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
fast forward program and say I need help
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
and then fast forward helps them to
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
determine what kind of assistance they
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
may need and in in some cases in this
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
case it would be that they are placed in
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
a facility to to support their needs but
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it isn't impacting them
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
educationally which is where we have
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
this it's the same as if a student was
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
placed by dcyf um and we cut and they
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
have the court order we pay for that
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
through our court ordered placement
 
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
through our court ordered placement
funds

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
and represent Tanner thank you and thank
 
00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:08.339 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I uh a
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
question about the funding uh the
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
funding part coming out of doe
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
um and I don't even pretend to know how
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
that whole funding situation on special
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
ed goes but I I do know that there's a
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
certain finite pot that
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
um is then prorated for disbursement for
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
to to special ed and I'm just wondering
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
does this money come out of that pot
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
that finite pot so it makes the pro
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
rating less
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
and is it also out of the educational
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
um that what you're referencing is our
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
special education Aid pot
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and that it does have a finite amount
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
of money and it does come out of the
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
um the court ordered placement money
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
does not have a finite amount of money
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
and I would have to ask Caitlyn what pot
 
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
of money it comes out of because I'm not
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
clear on that one
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
yes so just to be clear in my own mind
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
um if this goes through it's not going
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
to make any significant difference in
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
what reimbursement schools will get now
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh from proration after this goes
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
through because it's two separate two
 
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:26.750 align:start position:0%
through because it's two separate two
separate

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
um accounts okay thank you
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
um would a would a student and I have
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
two parts to this question because I
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
um if a student has an episode and has
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
to be hospitalized could they then be
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for a 504 plan at that time and
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
my second part is if they are
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
is there funding that could be accessed
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
to provide that so this is so this bill
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
is only for students who have been
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
identified with a disability
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
um through idea and have an IEP so it
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be for students that are 504 I
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
believe that DHHS pays for students who
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
are not in special education they paid
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the whole thing for any of the students
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
that are not in special education thank
 
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.789 align:start position:0%
that are not in special education thank
you

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you for
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if if they're
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
hospitalized and they are an IEP but the
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
IEP isn't for what they're hospitalized
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
for who pays for that right now without
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
this bill DHHS okay but they yeah but
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
there's no I don't know how they pay it
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't want to speak to that so
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
it gets paid for by the state it's not
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
something that like say it's a student
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
for me or Chester it doesn't come
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester doesn't have to pay for it no
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
further questions I just have a oh yes
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni thank you Mr
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
um so if it isn't coming so what funds
 
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
are coming out of the district then
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the um currently if they determine
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
so there's the two scenarios if they
 
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419 align:start position:0%
determine it's not something they would
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
have done for an IEP then they do not
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
pay anything currently if they do
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
determine it is something they would
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
have paid for through the IEP they pay
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the entire educational portion of
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
the placement with no assistance from us
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
um they could they could go to special
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
education aid but then that goes back to
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives Tanner's concern about
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um making that proration for special
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
education Aid um less to each School
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
um just for my own clarification
 
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.770 align:start position:0%
um just for my own clarification
possibly

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
possibly
um

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
if the student is a special needs
 
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.210 align:start position:0%
if the student is a special needs
student

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.289 align:start position:0%
student
but

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
the placement is outside of idea outside
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
of their disability such as you said a
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
threat is home or something
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
I thought I also heard that since that
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
child is a special needs student the
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would pick up
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
am I mistaken in that
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of that okay
 
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.029 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of that okay
um

00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
but so to clarify the school district is
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
still responsible for the provision of
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
special education if they are placed so
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
they ensure that they um collaborate
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
with whatever school that is that the
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
child has gone to and ensure that either
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're sending somebody to provide
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
services to the child or that they're
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
working with that school to ensure that
 
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:30.860 align:start position:0%
special ed is provided
 
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.450 align:start position:0%
special ed is provided
so

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.409 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
if the placement is made by DHHS and
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
they are a special needs child but the
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
placement is not a result of their
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
special needs then the cost would be
 
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative
 
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.430 align:start position:0%
any further questions yes representative
Damon

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and please tell me if
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't an appropriate request
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
could there be a fact sheet that lists
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the various scenarios and who currently
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
covers them sure because I'm finding it
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
hard to take this off it is definitely
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
and get it straight yes it is very
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
confusing that would be very helpful
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Lakers
 
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:27.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering this to follow
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
on with what he said
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass this bill
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
and so the way it is currently if
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
the child has an IEP but that doesn't
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
include the same placement but
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
um DHHS decides the placement like for
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
the example which you said
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um then the school district itself
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the IEP would have
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
to pick up
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
all of the what costs so they would have
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
to so they would have to pick up the
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
costs if they determined that that yes
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
it is an appropriate placement based on
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
their special education say they've
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
already been having difficulty with the
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
child they've been trying to determine
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to support the child
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
and when that placement happens they are
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
supposed to have an IEP meeting and they
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
say we were already headed in this
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
direction anyway we're going to agree to
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
this yes they would pick up the entire
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
cost of of that or they would apply for
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
special education Aid which would then
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
make that proration even less first
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
but if we if they
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
if the issue isn't related to their
 
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.890 align:start position:0%
if the issue isn't related to their
disability

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
like problems at home or suicidal or
 
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.590 align:start position:0%
like problems at home or suicidal or
whatever

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we don't pass this how is how is the
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
money and spending divided up
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
so then it would if they determined that
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
it was not part of the IEP currently
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS is
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
um paying for that but it was not
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
something that they had planned on
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure they would have to
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
ask them about their financial situation
 
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you Becky just a last question
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
for me is do you have any data on how
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
many students are the number of students
 
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.669 align:start position:0%
many students are the number of students
that

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:32.690 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
fall under these episodes of treatments
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
that don't get
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
um or state funds or not because it's
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
just started so it's been it's been a we
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
had to put the TA out to assist with
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
districts and make sure that they knew
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
what we were what was supposed to happen
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
so with the 50 kids that have gone I
 
00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's that's all kids not
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
just students with disabilities right
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the number of how
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
they've determined that I would I would
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to reach out to every district and
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
say you know how many yeah
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow thank you
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
so is there any cost that a parent has
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
to bear on that
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
um that would be a question for DHHS
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
because they determine that for their
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
fast forward programs yeah probably I
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
would assume so yes thank you yep
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
I've seen none thank you very much
 
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.730 align:start position:0%
I've seen none thank you very much
um

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
is there any other cards no other cards
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from Department of
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
see none
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
um no one else wishes to testify
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we'll
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we'll all be breaking for

01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
communities programs of community
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%

the math learning communities program of
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
the community college system and making
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
an appropriation therefore and I call on
 
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:06.659 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd for a motion yes I like to

make the motion OTP for 419. I'd second
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
that second by representative Miler
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you discussion by the chairman uh
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
basically we've had a math learning
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
communities on the books uh previously
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
in in statute uh it's a program which
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
assists uh the teaching of mathematics
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
in the high school and and better
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
prepares students for the transition to
 
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
community college system and careers it
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
allows us to provide an alternative
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
track for grades 10 and 11 and 12 and it
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
also enables us to have an assessment to
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
better understand where students are in
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
terms of understanding algebraic
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
Concepts and principles at the end of
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
that 10th grade after algebra one and
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
then with parent permission school
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
counselor teachers
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
um decision can be made to track the
 
01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
youngster students into the foundations
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
for mathematics and quantitative math
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
and quantitative math is of course it
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
passed they get their Collegiate credit
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the post-secondary they're all
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
prepared and we've seen success we have
 
01:41:16.669 --> 01:41:16.679 align:start position:0%
38 high schools that have participated
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
in this in the past there's training
 
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
provided through this program we're
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
talking two hundred thousand dollars and
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
the training is provided by the
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
community college system by the Beth
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
Dorian that's over there at the
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
community college system in the summer
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
we have we pull teachers down from this
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
high schools into the Community College
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
train them we have teachers teaching
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
teachers they go back with materials all
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
the materials are provided through the
 
01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.050 align:start position:0%
the materials are provided through the
program

01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:41.060 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage that we move
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh any comments by the secondary
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
no just I do have some numbers here I
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
was talking with Rick earlier for 419
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
for those who who signed in online you
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
had three that supported it and no no
 
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.850 align:start position:0%
had three that supported it and no no
opposition

01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.129 --> 01:42:06.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on the bill by the
 
01:42:10.679 --> 01:42:12.169 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on the bill by the
committee

01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh president woodcock
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli let's
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
generalize the question on the effective
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
date uh is is this is this July 1
 
01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.810 align:start position:0%
date uh is is this is this July 1
uh

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
is it if this goes through and through
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
both houses and the governor would be
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
Levy time enough to cover next Falls
 
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.270 align:start position:0%
Levy time enough to cover next Falls
classwork

01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
classwork
 
01:42:34.129 --> 01:42:34.139 align:start position:0%
I believe was a community college system
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
and the appropriation of dollars which
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
they have I think it's timely
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
um we have the because part of this is
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
already in statute right so it would
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
just it just it's going to provide us
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
the green light of pursuing this program
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
I think all the the statutory uh is
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
basically in place uh so I think it's
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
possible okay um if we see something
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
going on as far as the time in this
 
01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:01.340 align:start position:0%
there's the opportunity that I'm I'm
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'll see more teacher recruitment for it
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's all yeah okay yeah I think we're
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman
 
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman
cordelli

01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative cascaden
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um my question is the funding for this
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
program is it for two years just
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
just two years or is it going to be
 
01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:25.669 align:start position:0%
just two years or is it going to be
sustainable

01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
I think it is two years I think during
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
that time though we have the opportunity
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
to watch this program and then go
 
01:43:45.729 --> 01:43:45.739 align:start position:0%
further with it
 
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's something that we're using the Next
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
Generation accuplacer uh is that the
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
right tool I I've been told by the
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
Community College it is for the high
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
school however there may be some tweaks
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
and changes that come out of having
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
teachers uses for two years and and I
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
think at that time we can make it uh
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
the funding will course change
 
01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.169 align:start position:0%
the funding will course change
yeah

01:44:12.169 --> 01:44:12.179 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
further questions comments
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh see no
 
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:19.500 align:start position:0%

01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
something we're not taking testimony I

and discussion
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've had a lot of discussion on this
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh academic research and Improvement
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
performance Analyst at the department we
 
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
feel that the department in this regard
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
is very very understaffed with just one
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
individual there with Dr Nate green this
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
will better help us understand and
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
interpret the data we're getting back
 
01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
from the Statewide assessment it also
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
allows us to get down into the weeds
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
track cohorts and to train and work with
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
folks out in the school districts
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
yesterday when I met with the
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
superintendents over the Capone Center
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
they were very excited about this bill
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that they may get some support
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
this is smaller districts don't have
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
this type of a support to really get
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
down and do this this will provide them
 
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
information and possibly save dollars
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
out in the field whereas if you're
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
seeing a weakness in one of your subject
 
01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
areas you don't have to dump the whole
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
program you can try to determine where
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
in the program you need some changes and
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
this analysis analyst will help you work
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
and accomplish that and thank you
 
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.270 align:start position:0%
and accomplish that and thank you
sure

01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%

01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Myler uh yes

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
and for a post okay
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%

second on that I just remember from all
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
my years of being in a school getting
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
back the information it would be so
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
helpful to have somebody help you design
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know how to work with the areas that
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
you know your school scored low on or
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
even individual students
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
so this would be very helpful
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%

chair and and uh and I'll be quick on
 
01:51:41.689 --> 01:51:41.699 align:start position:0%
this as a lot a lot we can say on it but
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
we've actually got a full committee work
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
session I think scheduled for tomorrow
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
on a number of school funding bills but
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think everybody in this um around the
 
01:51:52.729 --> 01:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
table here appreciates how how
 
01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.830 align:start position:0%
table here appreciates how how
complicated

01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the school funding uh uh school
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
funding matters are in New Hampshire and
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
that a one-size-fits-all approach to
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
school funding uh is uh is not
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily is is not going to do the
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
trick and um and it certainly leaves out
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
many school districts uh especially the
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
one that um that representative
 
01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:16.850 align:start position:0%
one that um that representative
cascadden

01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
um had had led uh for so many years up
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
in up in Berlin so um so I appreciate
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsors the intent behind
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
this but look forward to working with
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor down the road as we as we
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
tackle this um this problem thank you
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
huge problem
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
huge consideration are this further
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
consideration for me represent Miler uh
 
01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:45.739 align:start position:0%
just again the electronic uh on this
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
submissions were 42 support 7 opposed
 
01:52:54.649 --> 01:52:54.659 align:start position:0%
okay president represent Ellison oh
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
reinforce what representative Bluetooth
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
said that this is a complicated issue
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
but that that bill moves us right in a
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
very strong Direction and that when
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
we're doing getting together and we're
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
looking at various bills and trying to
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
make sense out of this that we in fact
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
do include the prime sponsor of this
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
bill and those discussions thank you
 
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:22.500 align:start position:0%

motion I make the motion of OTP
 
01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
the second by representative Cornell
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.370 align:start position:0%

Cornell
um

01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:21.830 align:start position:0%
um
I'm

01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me I'll go ahead and speak
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
as the maker of the motion uh this is an
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
um Career Technical Education Centers
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
and working with the directors and all
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
the the centers in this state over 20
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then and we also have an issue with
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
five of them being across the river in
 
01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.090 align:start position:0%
five of them being across the river in
Vermont

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
and are sending the students from the
 
01:55:46.129 --> 01:55:46.139 align:start position:0%
sending schools to the
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
um the career tech centers we are
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
sending approximately I'm just going to
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
use rounded off figures we have about 10
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
000 students attending of which 8 000
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
students live and reside in The District
 
01:56:00.169 --> 01:56:00.179 align:start position:0%
in which they have the CT Center and go
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
to the high school in that CTE Center
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
about 2 000 students are sent via
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
transportation from a sending school to
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
the receiving Center
 
01:56:11.570 --> 01:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
and the way we reimburse Transportation
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
right now is at 10 cents per mile per
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
pupil on these buses that is really
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
tough for our school districts are
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
sending especially smaller all districts
 
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
all districts they're sending on one of
 
01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
these multiple passenger yellow buses uh
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
elementary kids 66 kids on that bus and
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
we may have three or four kids that are
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
going to the CTE Center because that's
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
the space are the seats available for
 
01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
that CTE youngster student
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so it's really turning into a
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous unfunded uh a cost that's
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
been hammered down to the local school
 
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
districts and we recognize that and it's
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
also causing some uh school districts uh
 
01:56:58.729 --> 01:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
say we can't afford to send these kits
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
and that's something we don't want
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
either so we're looking in this bill
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
another way of establishing the
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement formula currently we fund
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
CTE centers at nine million dollars per
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
year and out of that nine million
 
01:57:14.209 --> 01:57:14.219 align:start position:0%
dollars we first take out the
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
transportation costs and we do it via
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
that formula 10 cents per mile it adds
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
up close to seven hundred thousand
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
dollars six hundred eighty thousand
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
and the remainder of the money is then
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
used for tuition costs and we want to
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
have more kids participate but the more
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
kids participate then our tuition costs
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
are being hammered because we have to
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
prorate those monies around just the the
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
growing numbers so the rescinding
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
districts receive less and less as a
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
result so this entire formula needs a
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
good strict look at and we're suggesting
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill go in effect in July 1
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
2025 it gives the department time to put
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
in place the the the recommendations
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
which are coming forth in the in the
 
01:57:58.370 --> 01:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
statutory language is coming forth that
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation be based upon funding
 
01:58:03.890 --> 01:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursement based upon the type of
 
01:58:06.770 --> 01:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
vehicle the mileage that's driven and
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
the number of trips which are made daily
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
this will make a significant difference
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
and of course there might be different
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
mileage costs there should be mileage
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
costs when we're talking about a van
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
versus a large school bus or or some
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
other means of transportation we do know
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
too that the the student that transports
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
themselves with the approval of the
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
ascending District it's at 25 cents per
 
01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
mile and that's uh you know hard too so
 
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is certainly another attempt
 
01:58:40.729 --> 01:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
working with our our school districts
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
our CTE centers the directors
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
to re uh you know reimagine how we're
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
going to be funding transportation and
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is how this bill is really a
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
replicate of what the Kansas State
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is doing for
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
their students and there's a number of
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
states which are doing just this other
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
than what 10 cents per mile which is is
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:12.860 align:start position:0%
uh is there it is
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
agree with what rep plaid said being on
 
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee I think one topic
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
conversation that comes up a lot is the
 
01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
the cost of transporting students and
 
01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
how some districts students they just
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
decide not to allow the students to go
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford the
 
01:59:31.729 --> 01:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
transportation and also we really
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
underfund CTE
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
other than Transportation anyway just
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
looking at the handout that we had
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
gotten and comparing us to Delaware we
 
01:59:42.410 --> 01:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
give 9 million and Delaware because 89
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
million to CTE so I think we have a lot
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
more to do yeah and the percentage of
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
kids that go to CT in Delaware are well
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent and ours is well below
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
well below 50 down in the teens and we
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
want more kids getting these skills they
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
come out with a skill they come out with
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
a job they come out with achievement
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
scores and on average five percentage
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
points above those coming out of the
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
regular High School
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh there's a whole lot of
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
different programs which we're unaware
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
of and we don't really see what these
 
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
CTS are teaching now when I was at a CT
 
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
Center down in Salem where uh director
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
Dodge works I can remember talking to
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
one of the girls I saw in a classroom
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
there and this is a you know the old
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
vocational school but this is not the
 
02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
vocational school this is a high-tech
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
school and she was majoring in in
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
medical uh areas dealing with Computer
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
Sciences Etc and I said where are you
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
going to go to school next year she said
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
ah I've already been accepted early
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
acceptance Virginia Tech
 
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
and and so we need to encourage this and
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
we need more kids attending our CTE
 
02:00:58.490 --> 02:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
centers without a doubt so I I support
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell what she's doing
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
over there I was on that Council too and
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
I can remember every year we're looking
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
at the next thing it's going to come
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
down the road is tuition
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to reimport
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
reverse more for tuition if we actually
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
fund Transportation the way we should
 
02:01:18.370 --> 02:01:18.380 align:start position:0%
fully fund it it'd be
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
2.6 million dollars rather than the six
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to really
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
support the whole nine yards we're
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
talking more but we're taking it step by
 
02:01:30.649 --> 02:01:30.659 align:start position:0%
step here and going after the tuition
 
02:01:33.729 --> 02:01:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh yes the uh the electronic uh
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
responses were six support zero opposed
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman here are you talking
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
about the various CTE commission uh
 
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
programs I just say to throw in a little
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh public relations piece here for
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
Conway and our newest program are highly
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
successful is Aviation they're flying
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
they're getting pilot licenses they have
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
simulators they use the regular plane to
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
the airport it's terrific and they're
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
going into Eli's work as Clinton knows
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
in drone work yeah yeah and thank you
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
very much what represent Woodcock and
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
they've also developed some Hardware
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
which has gone up with NASA and at
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
Kennett they're doing a wonderful job up
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
there it's one of the centers that I'd
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
love to be living in and and have send
 
02:02:20.689 --> 02:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
my own kids to it because there would be
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
a job waiting for them
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
by the way the last 747 came off the
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
line yesterday and that's it
 
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
um when we talk in committee we uh
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
talked about the effective date
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
of 2025 and we talked about why not 2024
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.159 --> 02:02:46.010 align:start position:0%
 
it's

02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
I I think what we're we're going to be
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
crowding it a little bit this is a
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
Formula which there they may come up
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
with tweaking that formula a little bit
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh so I I didn't change that date if the
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
doe feels they can do that this is going
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
to go to another committee uh it's going
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate and we can change
 
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
the date there so I think the best thing
 
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
for us do is move it now and ask that
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
question representative Hall uh later on
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
in a couple months here we can still
 
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
change that yes great thank you it's a
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
good point
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:03:25.729 --> 02:03:25.739 align:start position:0%

02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm going to jump over the next bill
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
and go to 272 and open this bill up HB
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
272 is increasing Charter Public School
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
per pupil funding
 
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm opening this bill up
 
02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:46.129 align:start position:0%
so I'm opening this bill up
and

02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to close it right off here
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take any action on
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
this one today but we are in exact
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
session on this bill and so we will be
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
coming back and let me explain to people
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
that we're all recognizing that this
 
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
bill has there is a need behind it
 
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:04.149 align:start position:0%
bill has there is a need behind it
however

02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's tied into a number of other bills
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with per pupil costs not just
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools but elsewhere and we're
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
looking at the possibility of tying this
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
thing together with other legislation
 
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
so that will have to be done when we
 
02:05:20.089 --> 02:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
deal with other legislation as well so
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to not exact that today and
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
I'm going to address the second to no to
 
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
recess we're going to recess this to a
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
time to be announced so we will go then
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
on to
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
go check on copies for 103 and 147
 
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
magnets that I have
 
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
yeah let's go on do 577 also right now
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
because uh this bill is very similar to
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
what we just did relative to state aid
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
for special education pupils I like to
 
02:06:01.729 --> 02:06:01.739 align:start position:0%
open this up and and have discussion
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're not I'm not going to take any kind
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
of recommendations at this time but I'd
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
like to have a little bit of a
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on it other than myself this
 
02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
is a BL 577 relative to State a for
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
special education pupils and what it's
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
doing in a nutshell we have what we call
 
02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
special education Aid it's what's called
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid there's a specific
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
formula on how districts that have
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities that have a
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
need for a real intensive training in
 
02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:36.860 align:start position:0%
this area and maybe and definitely even
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
residential placement or or Hospital
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
placement there's a lot to this it's a
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
very important bill and the way the
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
formula works and then we'll have a
 
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
little discussion on it is that it's
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
based upon the average cost per pupil to
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
multiply that by three and a half times
 
02:06:59.930 --> 02:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say hypothetically the
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
average cost of twenty thousand dollars
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
before a District's going to even start
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
receiving any support for this other
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
than through differentiated aid for that
 
02:07:10.729 --> 02:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
student which is a little over two
 
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to go to three and
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
a half times that average cost Source
 
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to expend seventy
 
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars before they're going to
 
02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive any kind of
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid then for the next
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
portion up to 10 times that they're
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to receive
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
20 support of that
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
um the 80 is paid by the state and above
 
02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
10 times the state takes over this is a
 
02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
huge cost districts huge cost is built
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
we recognize
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that it's really a a a a mandate
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
that goes drops down to local districts
 
02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you pay these initial
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
costs so I'm going to drop it right
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
there and open up for a discussion from
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um and
 
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for um for uh
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
allowing this committee to uh to hold on
 
02:08:13.550 --> 02:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the last bill as well as this one
 
02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.209 align:start position:0%
to the last bill as well as this one
um

02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that we can learn a little bit
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
more about it when it um when we heard
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
it last week
 
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:28.940 align:start position:0%
um it had a um it it did not have a a a
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
and you know and I I everybody's working
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
hard on these fiscal notes so I'm not
 
02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not throwing anybody under the bus
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
but uh but it had one of those sort of
 
02:08:41.089 --> 02:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
indeterminable fiscal notes and I think
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful as you know to
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
to have a better understanding and maybe
 
02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:48.020 align:start position:0%
if there's a way the department
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
might be able to look at
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
um look at you know back in the napkin
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
costing out going from the one and a
 
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
half Benchmark that this is at all the
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
way up to three and a half maybe in in
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
you know half Point
 
02:09:05.159 --> 02:09:06.490 align:start position:0%
you know half Point
um

02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:06.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh yeah increments
 
02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
um we'd we'd at least be we'd be able to
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
have a um uh you know a series of costs
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
around it so we could do exactly what
 
02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
you suggested
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
um um Mr chair which is um maybe one and
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
a half's not the answer maybe three and
 
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
a half's not the answer maybe it's
 
02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
something in there and see how that fits
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
in with some of the other um school
 
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:30.589 align:start position:0%
in with some of the other um school
funding

02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
um legislation we're looking at I I
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
concur with you and not having that
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and this is a policy
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee got it
 
02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
however the policy is that as a
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
recologist off the top of my I thought
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
we were talking uh in this category in
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
the Department's here approximately 760
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
kids in that what qualify for cat Aid
 
02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
because specialized Aid
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
if you drop this down to three times so
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
you're taking that half off
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
of using the formula which you know I
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
just had a 20 brand you're talking ten
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars multiply that times to
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
760 what do you come up 7.6 million
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
dollars or something like that
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
roughly my my grade school math 760 at
 
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
that point pardon me it's not 760. the
 
02:10:18.609 --> 02:10:18.619 align:start position:0%
number of kids
 
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
students but that are three times yes
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be more and that's that's
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
the point I'm saying is that that trying
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
to say that we know it's going to be
 
02:10:31.129 --> 02:10:31.139 align:start position:0%
more than that seven million dollars
 
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to be more than that and
 
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's what we don't know as you drop it
 
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
down from three three and a half to
 
02:10:39.649 --> 02:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
three to two and a half to two to one
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
and a half one what does that mean in
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of gaining more students that
 
02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
qualify for this and what are the costs
 
02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
we don't have that information
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
and sending something on the finance
 
02:10:55.450 --> 02:10:55.460 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm fearful that Finance you know
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at the dollars and I'm
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
trying to also look at the policy behind
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
this do we have to tweak other areas of
 
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
this program too
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
um do you reach full funding uh a little
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
later on in the game and rather than
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
going eight times you know or or the 80
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
range do we tweak that somewhere there's
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of places when this whole formula
 
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
that can be looked at policy wise in
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
terms of who's qualifying and for this
 
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
extra support or not and for that reason
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
I too cannot make a decision today I
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the information to do it and
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
so that's why I I'm not going to take
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of recommendation whether it's
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
up or down or retain it's an important
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
issue if we retain it we don't address
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
this thing till November and and we're
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road
 
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so it's time to really get a good
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
handle on so I would ask that if we're
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
able to get the data that both reps on
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
luno and I are asking for that will be
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
of tremendous help to us to try and
 
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
address a better policy answer on this
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
any other discussion from our committee
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to also
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
um along with playing with a three and a
 
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
half number and looking at the step
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
increments it may be worth us looking at
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
also looking at the um the 80 20
 
02:12:19.129 --> 02:12:19.139 align:start position:0%
reimbursement percentage as far as
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
because that that seems to me that's
 
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
going to be the crusher for smaller
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
districts who have you know a small
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
number of very expensive students yeah I
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
I would I would agree with you that's
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
why I mentioned that portion too this
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
summer I think it was either July or
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
August I was called down to the office
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
here and I was talking with a community
 
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
that had a school board member there and
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
Leadership and they're saying wow we're
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
short 1.5 million dollars in this we
 
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
don't have it in the bank to help pay
 
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
for this residential cost and our costs
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
and and we're ending up having to take
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
this out of other other operational
 
02:12:59.330 --> 02:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
areas within our budget and that's part
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
of the policy issue we're dealing with
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
other words this is a mandate in the in
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
the former of reimbursement is based
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
upon the previous year's spending and
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
and are re receipts and
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
so a district has to come up with this
 
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a reserve account if
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have that their small
 
02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
District they are going to have to
 
02:13:23.689 --> 02:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
figure out how to pay for this and
 
02:13:25.010 --> 02:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to raise the
 
02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:26.030 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to raise the
revenue

02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're looking at we might
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
be able to find some in our operating
 
02:13:31.810 --> 02:13:31.820 align:start position:0%
budget and that's going to subtract from
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
programming that they're looking forward
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
to doing whether it's professional
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
development or it's usually labor costs
 
02:13:40.609 --> 02:13:40.619 align:start position:0%
even bigger than that to try and make up
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
the difference so this has a lot of
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
policy implications to us and that's why
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
we need more time to try and filter
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
through this a bit
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
further discuss representative Damon
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.689 --> 02:14:01.699 align:start position:0%
optimism that we will address this
 
02:14:03.890 --> 02:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
effectively so there's an improvement in
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
special education funding
 
02:14:10.129 --> 02:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
not waiting for November or as you put
 
02:14:13.129 --> 02:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
it passing it on
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
um these small districts really need
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
this help
 
02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
imminently thank you
 
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
we are got we have a deadline on these
 
02:14:25.129 --> 02:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
early bills we have to decide this issue
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do one way or the
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
other retain OTP itl by the 16th of
 
02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.510 align:start position:0%
other retain OTP itl by the 16th of
February

02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
February
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
so yes it's not going to be kicked down
 
02:14:37.729 --> 02:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
we got to do something
 
02:14:37.739 --> 02:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
we got to do something
yes

02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:42.729 --> 02:14:42.739 align:start position:0%
okay uh so I'm going to

Dual and concurrent enrollment program
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
by the community college system and
 
02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:09.179 align:start position:0%

discussion

02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh I'd like to very much
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
HB 420 has been a bill it's a topic
 
02:15:36.290 --> 02:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
which we have discussed here for the
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
last five years or so for the concurrent
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program and it's a
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
program with running start and restart
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
and Etc offered by our community college
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with high schools when
 
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's concurrent in Duo enrollment
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
um we've seen a lot of wonderful success
 
02:15:58.010 --> 02:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
when we first started this program
 
02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I've mentioned to the committee
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
before when I I worked with uh
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh Chancellor Ross cattell
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
and Todd Leach uh the four-year system
 
02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
which the four-year system begged not to
 
02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
get involved with it seeing that they
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
could not provide this at the cost at
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the tuition cost that the uh community
 
02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
college system was offering and that we
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
were expecting
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so we went ahead and we budgeted
 
02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
that year close to 1.5 million dollars
 
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
or so 600 and I think 650 000 first year
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
950 000 the second year and tremendous
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
response for grades uh 11 and 12
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
students and it was centered around stem
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
students stem courses
 
02:16:47.209 --> 02:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
and we went the direction of the stem
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
courses initially seeing that we knew we
 
02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough funding available for
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
everything and so we narrowed it
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
narrowed the focus down
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and so with that over the years
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
we've done some changes we've tweaked
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
the program now so students in grades 10
 
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 can participate and we've
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
upped the ante as far as how much we've
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
supported the the the concurrent dual
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment program in this bill
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh request what is it
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
3.25 million dollars per year to support
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
this program but it also opens the
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
program up
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
to all courses uh that you know be on
 
02:17:36.889 --> 02:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
stem which is an important item in fact
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
that there's many students that don't
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
want to take a science
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
or technology course or a math course
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
they just like to get a few basic
 
02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
college courses under their belt find
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
out what it's all about they may be the
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
liberal arts type courses however once
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
they're in there they're finding I can
 
02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
do this it's just like when we initially
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
required the SAT to be given to all kids
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
and the main they found out by mandating
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
the sat in the 11th grade the kids which
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
are taking the SAT all sudden found wow
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
I got a score which is a pretty decent
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
score I can go to college and so Maine
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
immediately saw more students choosing
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
to opt go that pathway rather than
 
02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
jumping out right after high school and
 
02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
looking for a a skill or a job to to
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
work in I think that's what this program
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
does it also does the very important
 
02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
thing which I I think was really
 
02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
thing which I I think was really
appreciated

02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
we keep more students in the state of
 
02:18:34.849 --> 02:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by getting students
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
engaged in the community college system
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
early on in the 10th grade 11th grade
 
02:18:42.889 --> 02:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
and 12th grade they can come out of
 
02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
there now taking up to five courses a
 
02:18:49.209 --> 02:18:49.219 align:start position:0%
year and come out with a real good
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
background and and go into a two-year
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
degree with a year already knocked off
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
or go into the four-year system which we
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
of course is now after what we did last
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
year which are mutually agreed upon for
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
transfer from the community college
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
through the high school I mean to high
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
school to the for your system so this
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
has been really beneficial the first
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
year we did this by spending that 1.5
 
02:19:17.929 --> 02:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
million we estimated that we were able
 
02:19:20.929 --> 02:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
to say parents from having the expense
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
of having to pay for these colleges upon
 
02:19:26.929 --> 02:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
college courses after graduation at that
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
time the savings to parents was 6
 
02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars when we did the estimate
 
02:19:34.849 --> 02:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
of what this was saving by having the
 
02:19:38.209 --> 02:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
courses 150 bucks paid for by the state
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
while they're in Cal in in high school
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop right there I feel it's an
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
excellent program we mimicked it or took
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of the initial stuff from Wyoming
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
where they have seven community colleges
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
out there we have seven community
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
colleges here and they were in
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment and these
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment programs are
 
02:20:01.849 --> 02:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
recognized we we ensure that they're
 
02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
taught in the high schools at the
 
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
national standards that we have
 
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
established as a country and in
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
conformance with what the community
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
college requires and New England
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
Association of schools and colleges
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
requires that you have a master's and
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
that you have the professional
 
02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
background in the area that you're
 
02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
teaching so that is a real uh good point
 
02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
also so thank you very much
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the second was made by representative
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
Miler uh yes I just uh I don't want to
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
take much of our time on this but just
 
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
to reiterate uh what chairman Latta said
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that this has been a proven program I'm
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
pleased that this expands the
 
02:20:44.929 --> 02:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students to experience
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
the programs uh Beyond just the the stem
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
issues and it also provides an
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students to have some
 
02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
experience from a college course
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint plus as the chairman Ladd
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
said it also provides a financial
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
incentive for students to take these
 
02:21:04.969 --> 02:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
courses I know I've often looked at the
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
two young men that were what were our
 
02:21:10.490 --> 02:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
neighbors and they were home like at one
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon and I'm saying
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
well isn't there something else for them
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
to do and so this provides an
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to fill their
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
schedule and take their academic time to
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
a different level thank you very much
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there further
 
02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing it yes nope not seeing any uh
 
02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk would you please call the
 
02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:38.389 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk would you please call the

here

02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay where the next bill we're going to
 
02:24:17.570 --> 02:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
do is HB 365 relative to the Statewide
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
facility condition assessment for school
 
02:24:19.319 --> 02:24:20.330 align:start position:0%
facility condition assessment for school
buildings

02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:24:23.690 --> 02:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
behind the doc uh the Cavalier
 
02:24:26.330 --> 02:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh this is
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
House Bill 365 and I call upon chairman
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
laad for a motion uh yes thank you very
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
much I would make the recommendation of
 
02:24:38.270 --> 02:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
OTP for HP 365. second uh representative
 
02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
Miler makes the second
 
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh discussion by the chair yes
 
02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:45.469 align:start position:0%
uh discussion by the chair yes
um

02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
some people might ask why I'm making the
 
02:24:50.929 --> 02:24:50.939 align:start position:0%
motions all these bills are my bills and
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
I've got the blurbs already written and
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
so we're ready to fly on them
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
um save a lot of effort in somebody's
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
part uh HB 365 is uh dealing with the
 
02:25:04.210 --> 02:25:04.220 align:start position:0%
Statewide facility condition assessment
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh and it's it's tying into the skill
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
school building uh aid program which we
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
have and in that language where the
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
statute mentioned School building a one
 
02:25:18.050 --> 02:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
of the requirements which we had put in
 
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
place was we want to have a 10-year
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
Capital plan for our school building
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
facilities what we have out there so the
 
02:25:25.979 --> 02:25:27.290 align:start position:0%
facilities what we have out there so the
state

02:25:27.290 --> 02:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
will have a better idea of planning and
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
appropriating dollars uh for a state
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and that's what this
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
program does it doesn't mandate that you
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
have to have your plan in place but it
 
02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
encourages school districts to submit a
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
plan or where they're going in the next
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
10 years so we can better build the
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
state plan so that we will have an
 
02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we're going in
 
02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
terms of school building a everybody's
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with that we appropriate up to
 
02:25:59.090 --> 02:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars each year for school
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
building Aid which currently half of
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
that we're right at that point now we're
 
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
half of that still is going towards the
 
02:26:08.809 --> 02:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh paying off our previous debt
 
02:26:12.050 --> 02:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
and so so during the upcoming biennium
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be approving 100 million dollars
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
which 50 million dollars is going to go
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
to paying debt and 50 million dollars
 
02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
for new facilities which are tentatively
 
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
allocated for Rochester Colebrook and
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
Monadnock elementary schools
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have a laundry list of buildings that
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
are coming to us that are required
 
02:26:35.650 --> 02:26:35.660 align:start position:0%
asking for consideration in this process
 
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
applications have been received by
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which total over
 
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
500 million dollars of which our share
 
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
is over a little over 200 million
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
dollars when you take the 30 to 60
 
02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:47.770 align:start position:0%
dollars when you take the 30 to 60
percent

02:26:47.770 --> 02:26:47.780 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
obviously with that districts are seeing
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
they have needs even though we're going
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
through a time where the demographic in
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the state has declined over the last 10
 
02:27:01.250 --> 02:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
or so years from 210 000 students to 160
 
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
something thousand students uh that
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that all districts are like
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't mean all districts have
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
current buildings which are modern
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
buildings that are going to facilitate
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
the needs and demands of today's
 
02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
educational programming we know many do
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
not we know that many are over 50 years
 
02:27:20.770 --> 02:27:20.780 align:start position:0%
old over
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
60 years old now and this is
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um not uncommon we know that there's
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
places where remedial reading is being
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
taught in the locker room of the showers
 
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
I saw that myself in Allenstown several
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
years back we did when we did a little
 
02:27:38.809 --> 02:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
trip over there with some minor if you
 
02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
recall and that was a a sad thing to see
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
kids getting training in a shower room
 
02:27:47.210 --> 02:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
for reading and at lunch time you can
 
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
smell everything that was being cooked
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
in that kitchen throughout that entire
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
building and the ventilation system in
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
that building was not good
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we have these needs and yes we do
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
have extra money and all that which can
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
help limited area on HVAC but that's the
 
02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
extent of where that can be used we need
 
02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
to really step forward and this is a
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
first step on school building a program
 
02:28:11.450 --> 02:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
bills that you're going to see coming
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
forward this year this is just the front
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
edge we're going to be looking at a
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
total application process we've got to
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
look at the financial process which I've
 
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
already been heard by finance and so
 
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
this is just a policy consideration that
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
we need to get going on we need to have
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
a better understanding what's out there
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
and we need to work with these districts
 
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
and trying to get this 10-year plan
 
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Milan yes you're good
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative cascaden thank you uh
 
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're right we have so many schools
 
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
um really need a lot of renovation
 
02:28:54.530 --> 02:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
um we have K to five in an old high
 
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
school building that's a hundred years
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
old with staircases that you wouldn't
 
02:29:01.309 --> 02:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
even think of using yourself but
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I there is a great need to
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
know that and anticipate and the state
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
should know where different districts
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
are because building Aid is extremely
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to acquire
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
I just I wonder if
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be a requirement of
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
school districts to add that to their
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance staff or whoever is
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for buildings
 
02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder if the commissioner or
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
the department would develop a template
 
02:29:33.889 --> 02:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
for that assessment that would make
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
things consistent across the state in a
 
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for staff to follow
 
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you have that answer
 
02:29:45.889 --> 02:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
or not but that that that would ease the
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
need for this assessment the yes it's a
 
02:29:51.889 --> 02:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
good question it's good information uh
 
02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
of course in this bill we're encouraging
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
districts to do this but the template is
 
02:29:59.210 --> 02:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
going to be absolutely necessary we have
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
asked a the department in Prior years
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark
 
02:30:04.319 --> 02:30:05.570 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark
um

02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:07.010 align:start position:0%
um
to

02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
survey schools to find out what's out
 
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
there that survey has gone out but it's
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's General and it's being
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
completed by Personnel within the
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
schools some schools have a lot more
 
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
information on it seeing that they've
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
worked with engineers and Architects to
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
develop their site plans and they have
 
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
that others do not and and so we're
 
02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
getting kind of mixed feedback on that
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
however what this bill will do and I
 
02:30:35.690 --> 02:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
agree we do need to have some kind of a
 
02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
template to assist the school district
 
02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
saying hey we're looking at this we had
 
02:30:41.330 --> 02:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
last two years ago and where we were
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
trying to appropriate 3.3 million
 
02:30:49.969 --> 02:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
dollars for teams to go out and do that
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
assessment the teams would include an
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
engineer architect and a policy person
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
that that uh was rejected by Finance
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
and we even though we had the the money
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
there it was in sort of what I call it
 
02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
in the bank we had 1.3 million dollars
 
02:31:10.490 --> 02:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
carryover from the public school
 
02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and we had two
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is appropriated
 
02:31:15.889 --> 02:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
for the next year this biennium we're in
 
02:31:19.610 --> 02:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
so we had the 3.3 uh we had changed
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
course and we've used the 3.34 buildings
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
but for security issues and access
 
02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
issues in our schools which is also
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
needed so The Next Step would be to try
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
to get these plans so there's more meat
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
to it by providing that support that we
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
are initially after I think it's a great
 
02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
idea to send these teams out that's
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
happening in Montana right now where
 
02:31:44.929 --> 02:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
they send teams out in States all across
 
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
this country they're going out doing
 
02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
conditional assessments and looking at
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
technology they're looking at the shape
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the buildings in terms of delivery of
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction they're
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
looking at uh performance of energy in
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the buildings use of energy and they're
 
02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
looking at HVAC systems so they're
 
02:32:01.849 --> 02:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
looking all that and they have some real
 
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
accurate data which we have sort of but
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
not really good data and you're correct
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
and representative cascadden I know you
 
02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
know that as a superintendent and um so
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
this is really a step trying to
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
beef up the 20-year plan and I would
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
expect down the road we will shortly see
 
02:32:22.969 --> 02:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to go after those
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
teams going back out this was
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
recommended years or years ago also when
 
02:32:31.250 --> 02:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mark Joy Dr Mark Joyce was around and
 
02:32:33.770 --> 02:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
again rejected because of the cost so
 
02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's a long answer to your very good
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
question that's definitely the ideal
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative yes yep
 
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:46.020 align:start position:0%

let's see a motion uh thank you Mr
 
02:34:59.929 --> 02:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
chairman I wouldn't move a lot to pass
 
02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
and uh I would like to offer an
 
02:35:04.010 --> 02:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.330 --> 02:35:14.340 align:start position:0%

02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
this this amendment is based on
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
discussion we had at the public hearing
 
02:35:31.969 --> 02:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh there were questions about
 
02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
um the individual uh situation where uh
 
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
it was within the same SAU but a
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
different School District
 
02:35:46.969 --> 02:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
where the family member was involved so
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:54.969 --> 02:35:54.979 align:start position:0%
they can
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
serve on the school board of the
 
02:35:57.720 --> 02:35:58.690 align:start position:0%
serve on the school board of the
district

02:35:58.690 --> 02:35:58.700 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
in an SAU
 
02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
if it's in other district from which the
 
02:36:10.730 --> 02:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
sort of voids that conflict about
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
um a family member in the same district
 
02:36:23.469 --> 02:36:23.479 align:start position:0%
as the school board member
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
are there more but people down here
 
02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
don't have me oh I'm sorry
 
02:36:30.889 --> 02:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
so there's two on this one soon okay
 
02:36:33.889 --> 02:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:46.849 --> 02:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
you can see lines five through eight
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%

um as briefly discussed earlier
 
02:53:51.050 --> 02:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
um there was discussion uh during the
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I think that this
 
02:53:56.929 --> 02:53:56.939 align:start position:0%
amendment is being offered in relation
 
02:54:02.090 --> 02:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
to that testimony in that it clarifies
 
02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:03.590 align:start position:0%
to that testimony in that it clarifies
that

02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:03.600 --> 02:54:05.210 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
an employee of a district within an SAU
 
02:54:10.250 --> 02:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
may serve on a school board of a
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
district other than the district in
 
02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
which they are an immediate family
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
member unemployed
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
and goes on to say that
 
02:54:19.439 --> 02:54:21.889 align:start position:0%
and goes on to say that
um

02:54:21.889 --> 02:54:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
there is uh the Mandate that they recuse
 
02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
themselves of any matter involving
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
hiring terms of employment or
 
02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
termination of the superintendent as all
 
02:54:40.450 --> 02:54:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions about this but my
 
02:54:45.290 --> 02:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
02:54:48.550 --> 02:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
um the part that's that's actually uh
 
02:54:51.889 --> 02:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
removed no person holding the office of
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
member of the school board Shell at the
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
same time hold the office of District
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
moderator or Treasurer or auditor
 
02:55:00.769 --> 02:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
um with this amendment with this bill
 
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
does that then mean that people who are
 
02:55:05.570 --> 02:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
moderator Treasurer auditor can be on
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:16.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:55:16.090 --> 02:55:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:20.269 --> 02:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
that that provision is is removed
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh as a follow-up
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm correct I could be the moderate I
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
could be the moderator or even the
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
auditor and and serve on the school
 
02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:35.809 align:start position:0%
auditor and and serve on the school
board

02:55:35.809 --> 02:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.969 --> 02:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
if you look further down in the new
 
02:55:41.570 --> 02:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
section it can't be within the same
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
school district has to be in a different
 
02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:47.450 align:start position:0%
school district has to be in a different
District

02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't that just apply though to the
 
02:55:53.330 --> 02:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
salaried positions the teacher
 
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
professional custodian administrator
 
02:55:58.429 --> 02:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
secretary bus driver
 
02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
so the auditor could still be on the
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks thanks very much Mr chair
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of a question too and
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm and I'm looking down at line 17
 
02:56:22.429 --> 02:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
through 19 where where the I think
 
02:56:24.889 --> 02:56:24.899 align:start position:0%
you're you're referring to
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh people are in the immediate family of
 
02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
the school board member
 
02:56:31.610 --> 02:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
or prospective School Board member and
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
you've got child so if uh if if say a
 
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
school board member has a has a child
 
02:56:40.010 --> 02:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
who's a student maybe in you know 10th
 
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
11th 12th grade and is being paid by the
 
02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
district to tutor other other
 
02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
um students than the school board member
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the school board
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
member would
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
I guess immediately is this like an
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
ejection seat like the school board
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
members no longer a school board member
 
02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:02.090 align:start position:0%
members no longer a school board member
if

02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you know their their kid tutors and
 
02:57:06.590 --> 02:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
other kids and paid by the district or
 
02:57:08.690 --> 02:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
any of those other conditions
 
02:57:10.969 --> 02:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
um exist
 
02:57:12.830 --> 02:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
s within the same district
 
02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
um though I think this amendment does
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
improve upon the the foundational bill
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
it does seem that uh
 
02:57:31.730 --> 02:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
given the provision that it would go
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
into effect 60 days after passage
 
02:57:37.730 --> 02:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
um it may rather unfortunately put some
 
02:57:40.610 --> 02:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
towns who may be in this position in the
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
situation of having to do impromptu
 
02:57:46.250 --> 02:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
elections to fill seats on the school
 
02:57:46.260 --> 02:57:48.469 align:start position:0%
elections to fill seats on the school
board

02:57:48.469 --> 02:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:57:51.230 --> 02:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
very good point and something that
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
should be considered further discussion
 
02:57:57.469 --> 02:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh Balboni
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
um yes I actually served on the school
 
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
board that had four different districts
 
02:58:05.410 --> 02:58:05.420 align:start position:0%
and an SAU and one of the things that um
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
we know if you serve on a district
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
school board you're also automatically
 
02:58:13.969 --> 02:58:13.979 align:start position:0%
serve on the SAU school board and a lot
 
02:58:16.370 --> 02:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the just so in other words it says
 
02:58:18.429 --> 02:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
that you would recluse yourself
 
02:58:20.809 --> 02:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
from conditions of employment
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
termination of the superintendent there
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
are other Personnel involved in an SIU
 
02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
board that also would dictate
 
02:58:32.690 --> 02:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
things down to certain employers within
 
02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
the district and that would include the
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent special ed
 
02:58:37.790 --> 02:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
directors so there's a lot of other
 
02:58:40.849 --> 02:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
policies so in effect if you're serving
 
02:58:42.370 --> 02:58:42.380 align:start position:0%
on the sou board
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
you really are we'd have to recluse
 
02:58:48.110 --> 02:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
yourself from almost everything I would
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
think and that would put the district at
 
02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage two of our district
 
02:58:55.610 --> 02:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
boards only have three members the other
 
02:58:58.190 --> 02:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
two have five and if you're one of those
 
02:58:59.450 --> 02:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
districts that only have three
 
02:59:01.550 --> 02:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
automatically a representation on your
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh your school district for your CU is
 
02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
diminished thank you thank you further
 
02:59:08.210 --> 02:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
discussion on this representative
 
02:59:10.849 --> 02:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
cascadden thank you Mr chair
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
um I think I would want a little bit
 
02:59:15.050 --> 02:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
more clarification on this
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
um as to what it does for the simple
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
reason that
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
most school districts if not all will
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
have a policy manual
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
and this particular policy BCB is board
 
02:59:28.969 --> 02:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
member conflict of interest and nepotism
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
and I think these issues are addressed
 
02:59:34.849 --> 02:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
in those local policies so I'm not sure
 
02:59:38.210 --> 02:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do in addition to
 
02:59:40.730 --> 02:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
what's already on the local policies
 
02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we can't be sure
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
what all Local District policies are in
 
02:59:49.309 --> 02:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
terms of nepotism or anything else
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're reading from one particular local
 
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
policy we can't know what every district
 
02:59:56.090 --> 02:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
has for a policy

does say that he has an amendment to
this

04:13:19.010 --> 04:13:19.020 align:start position:0%

04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
in one of those and then one of these
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:10.490 --> 04:14:10.500 align:start position:0%

04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:31.490 --> 04:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
and this is a separate Amendment from
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner so there should be
 
04:14:35.689 --> 04:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
three pieces of paper coming around that
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's something else
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's part of the backup to cordelli's
 
04:14:59.689 --> 04:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:59.699 --> 04:15:37.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:15:37.570 --> 04:15:37.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.450 --> 04:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
you should have two amendments one of
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
which says is rep uh representative
 
04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
cordellis which is a zero two zero five
 
04:16:00.610 --> 04:16:00.620 align:start position:0%
h on it
 
04:16:00.620 --> 04:16:03.849 align:start position:0%
h on it
okay

04:16:03.849 --> 04:16:03.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.290 --> 04:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
this is a supporting document to
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli handed that out
 
04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
do we have uh more of these anywhere on
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.450 --> 04:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Balboni has some of them
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
two amendments
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
your amendments on the floor so
 
04:16:44.150 --> 04:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh we I think we can have a discussion
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
is everybody good to go now with the
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to ask uh even though we
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
have one amendment that we you know are
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
debating right now
 
04:17:05.090 --> 04:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to have some discussion
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
involving the other one as well we're on
 
04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
the same topic then we'll we'll vote on
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh there's been times in
 
04:17:16.030 --> 04:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
the past this is just for information
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we've merged stuff together too and
 
04:17:21.889 --> 04:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
made you know one but uh I haven't read
 
04:17:23.090 --> 04:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
either of these I don't know if that's
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
even possible but not for this one not
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
with this one okay okay so would you
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
please explain yours first and and then
 
04:17:31.080 --> 04:17:31.689 align:start position:0%
please explain yours first and and then
um

04:17:31.689 --> 04:17:31.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
products have represent uh Tanner
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
explain hers
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:17:39.300 --> 04:17:40.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

04:17:40.150 --> 04:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:45.290 --> 04:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
I served two terms on the advisory
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
committee for the education of students
 
04:17:49.389 --> 04:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
04:17:53.210 --> 04:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
currently the committee has something
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
like 36 members
 
04:17:59.650 --> 04:17:59.660 align:start position:0%
it is completely unwieldy
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
some I have talked to on the committee
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
say it's dysfunctional
 
04:18:04.920 --> 04:18:05.450 align:start position:0%
say it's dysfunctional
um

04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
it it'll take a half an hour 40 minutes
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
to approve the minutes from the last
 
04:18:10.739 --> 04:18:12.889 align:start position:0%
to approve the minutes from the last
meeting

04:18:12.889 --> 04:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to get things accomplished
 
04:18:19.370 --> 04:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
um so my
 
04:18:19.380 --> 04:18:22.130 align:start position:0%
um so my
Amendment

04:18:22.130 --> 04:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
does add the health care provider as in
 
04:18:27.170 --> 04:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
the original member
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
but revises the membership
 
04:18:33.650 --> 04:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
down to what is required
 
04:18:36.590 --> 04:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
under federal law under idea and that's
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
the supporting document that I handed
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
handed out with it it reduces the
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
membership to something more like 28
 
04:18:49.490 --> 04:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
members so a little bit better
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
um but the other thing it I tried to do
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
in here I specify 14 individuals with
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities or parents of children with
 
04:18:57.120 --> 04:18:58.550 align:start position:0%
disabilities or parents of children with
disabilities

04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements in federal law
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
is that parents have to be the majority
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't always happen now
 
04:19:13.450 --> 04:19:13.460 align:start position:0%
very often that is not the case
 
04:19:18.849 --> 04:19:18.859 align:start position:0%
so that is the other primary intent of
 
04:19:21.010 --> 04:19:21.020 align:start position:0%
my legislation
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it drastically
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
changes that focus at all of the
 
04:19:31.610 --> 04:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee in many cases it'll just
 
04:19:35.450 --> 04:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
revise two members down to one member in
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
some instances
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
but I think it's entirely necessary for
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
the committee to be a functioning body
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
to actually accomplish things
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:51.410 --> 04:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Tanner
 
04:19:53.210 --> 04:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
why don't you just you know on the same
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
topic here so I could explain what
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
you're up to too with yours sure so the
 
04:19:59.229 --> 04:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by representative
 
04:20:04.370 --> 04:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
catab and
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
um it was she
 
04:20:09.229 --> 04:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
was concerned about the committee that
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
there she would like to see a health
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
care provider on the committee a
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and in order to get the
 
04:20:17.450 --> 04:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
pediatrician on the committee because
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
this representative cordelli has stated
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's a rather large committee and half
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
of it has to be parents
 
04:20:24.600 --> 04:20:25.250 align:start position:0%
of it has to be parents
um

04:20:25.250 --> 04:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
she took one corrections officer off
 
04:20:31.490 --> 04:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
um as the the person that would be
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
deleted so that the health care provider
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
could be put in
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
my my Amendment simply specifies the
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
corrections officer that was taken off
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
in the underlying bill was at the State
 
04:20:45.180 --> 04:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
in the underlying bill was at the State
Corrections

04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
and uh had this I'm sorry the state
 
04:20:53.809 --> 04:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
corrections person had been left on and
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
what was taken off was the County
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
Corrections person and the feeling was
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
for the amendment to put the county
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
person back in and take the state out
 
04:21:06.889 --> 04:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
was that most children most youth who
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
are going to end up going through the
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
correction systems would start out with
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
some sort of issue with the county and
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
that the county person would be dealing
 
04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
with the you know the 16 17 18 year olds
 
04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
up to what is it 26 I think something
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
like that and at a lesser penalty
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
um stage catch them early and that the
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
so that's one part of the bill of the
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is just swapping those two
 
04:21:36.050 --> 04:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers that's in part cue
 
04:21:38.809 --> 04:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
and then in part T where where the
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider was put back in
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to we talked about it in
 
04:21:47.450 --> 04:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee actually about how nurse
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
practitioners and and other Physicians
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
might rather than just say a
 
04:21:55.610 --> 04:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
pediatrician so this one has uh that a
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
physician or a nurse practitioner who's
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice in New Hampshire
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
but then that specializes in work
 
04:22:03.610 --> 04:22:03.620 align:start position:0%
dealing with children with
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
neurodevelopmental disorders cognitive
 
04:22:08.929 --> 04:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
and behavioral assessments and pediatric
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
learning disorders and this person is
 
04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor so it just uh
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
delineated so it wasn't just the local
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
family physician that maybe dealt with
 
04:22:21.889 --> 04:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
maybe one child with disabilities this
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
person would have extensive knowledge in
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
that field so
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's that's the uh amendment that I'm
 
04:22:30.650 --> 04:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
offering to the underlying bill
 
04:22:33.410 --> 04:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you representative
 
04:22:37.969 --> 04:22:37.979 align:start position:0%
Tanner um I would just point out uh if
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
you'll uh notice on my um supplementary
 
04:22:41.340 --> 04:22:43.010 align:start position:0%
you'll uh notice on my um supplementary
handout

04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:22:47.090 --> 04:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
um under 300 168 membership
 
04:22:47.100 --> 04:22:48.590 align:start position:0%
um under 300 168 membership
um

04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:48.600 --> 04:22:50.750 align:start position:0%
um
11.

04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
11.
 
04:22:52.570 --> 04:22:52.580 align:start position:0%
a 11
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
sites is a requirement uh
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
representatives from the state Juvenile
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.279 --> 04:23:06.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:23:06.370 --> 04:23:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
Corrections people on the original
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.969 --> 04:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
that question addressed to represent
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
cordelli said yeah yeah okay
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
because if you're asking me I don't have
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.410 --> 04:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
the the uh the bill before I had this
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
the the the State Correctional
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.090 --> 04:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
but I'm not aware what the federal says
 
04:23:58.849 --> 04:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
it just says
 
04:23:58.859 --> 04:24:02.469 align:start position:0%
it just says
um

04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
representatives from the state Juvenile
 
04:24:13.689 --> 04:24:13.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.699 --> 04:24:15.370 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:24:15.370 --> 04:24:15.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
so the other question I think too and I
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
I guess I would address this to
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
is that uh representative Tanner's
 
04:24:25.020 --> 04:24:26.750 align:start position:0%
is that uh representative Tanner's
Amendment

04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:24:29.150 --> 04:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
is very specific
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
as relates to the
 
04:24:32.160 --> 04:24:33.889 align:start position:0%
as relates to the
medical

04:24:33.889 --> 04:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:24:33.899 --> 04:24:35.030 align:start position:0%
medical
um

04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:38.150 --> 04:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
medical representative on this committee
 
04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
and whether or not he would have
 
04:24:42.650 --> 04:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
problems because he basically just rep
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned a pediatrician and
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner says that the
 
04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
practitioner should be one who basically
 
04:24:51.650 --> 04:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
understands these kinds of issues not
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
just the GP that deals with uh with
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
pediatric issues that may not have an
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
understanding or an in-depth knowledge
 
04:25:03.889 --> 04:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
of the disorders that are here would you
 
04:25:08.210 --> 04:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
have a problem with uh an amendment
 
04:25:12.410 --> 04:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
to your cue which just merely says a a
 
04:25:12.420 --> 04:25:14.269 align:start position:0%
to your cue which just merely says a a
pediatrician

04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
pediatrician
 
04:25:16.729 --> 04:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
no you wouldn't have a problem with that
 
04:25:19.729 --> 04:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
with with the change you're right taking
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
the 10 or q and putting that on my
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
whatever okay all right thank you
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
so if I could request if that
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
um part of the two amendments is merged
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think it should say pediatrician nurse
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner or physician's assistant
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants and nurse
 
04:25:44.570 --> 04:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
practitioners are different training
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
represent pet now
 
04:25:54.370 --> 04:25:54.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner do we know if this
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
a physician or nurse practitioner with
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
these qualifications is actually
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
practicing in our state and if so how
 
04:26:08.030 --> 04:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
large is the pool of those types of
 
04:26:08.040 --> 04:26:11.570 align:start position:0%
large is the pool of those types of
practitioners

04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and and basically
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
it they didn't have to have it was it
 
04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
was to point out that the person the
 
04:26:21.649 --> 04:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
medical person had to be
 
04:26:21.659 --> 04:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
medical person had to be
um

04:26:22.490 --> 04:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
not only license to practice but had to
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
be aware of these other other spots it
 
04:26:29.450 --> 04:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't necessarily mean that
 
04:26:31.370 --> 04:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
they had to have every one of those they
 
04:26:34.490 --> 04:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
could be in each one and and I also
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
thought that the physician's assistant
 
04:26:42.849 --> 04:26:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.410 --> 04:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh there were a couple of your
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
first then I'll get you representative
 
04:26:49.010 --> 04:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
represent Hall you had your hand up
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
earlier uh thank you I was just going to
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
add just to say aunt or and then you'd
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
be all set on that on the Tanner
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the behavioral assessment
 
04:27:00.189 --> 04:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
and the cognitive
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
pediatric learning disorder if you do an
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
and or they would just have to be one of
 
04:27:03.960 --> 04:27:06.490 align:start position:0%
and or they would just have to be one of
those

04:27:06.490 --> 04:27:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.500 --> 04:27:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
um I realized just from I and I'm not in
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
depth on this at all
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
um that the mem the committee has way
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
too many members that it's um that has
 
04:27:22.729 --> 04:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
been stated before I think um in the
 
04:27:25.849 --> 04:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
cordelli amendment I I'm a little bit
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
um the person who's a representative
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
from the disabilities rights Center
 
04:27:33.889 --> 04:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
being crossed off I I find that a little
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
bit hard harsh and also the parents
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
information center because I think those
 
04:27:41.450 --> 04:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
are two areas where
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
um people get a lot of information and
 
04:27:46.130 --> 04:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
and they know what's going on in the
 
04:27:49.010 --> 04:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
legislature that sort of thing so I just
 
04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of a
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know a mishmash how you're going
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with this
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli thank you
 
04:28:03.530 --> 04:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I would just if we were to add them
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
back in then we would have to add
 
04:28:08.809 --> 04:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
parents back in and then we're pretty
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
much back up to where we are and
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:17.100 --> 04:28:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
testing

04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Woodcock thank you
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
chair my wife Roberta Cordell I'm
 
04:28:27.229 --> 04:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
looking at line nine
 
04:28:29.210 --> 04:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
talks about and you're a member of the
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
14 individuals and I'm looking at nine
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
third line 31 which seems to me to be
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
the same person or persons August 31
 
04:28:42.729 --> 04:28:42.739 align:start position:0%
says they may have may have received
 
04:28:44.689 --> 04:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
specialized services and it doesn't mean
 
04:28:46.729 --> 04:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
they have to be received so it seems to
 
04:28:52.610 --> 04:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
me the 14 in in line 9A and line of 31 H
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
could be combined because they're both
 
04:28:57.290 --> 04:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
individuals they're both special ed and
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're both may and they're both
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor that may still
 
04:29:01.250 --> 04:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
be one I don't know the difference
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
between the two if there is one gland
 
04:29:07.610 --> 04:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
I I would be open to some combination
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
thereof also just give you one spot back
 
04:29:12.769 --> 04:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
they're both the same group
 
04:29:12.779 --> 04:29:13.969 align:start position:0%
they're both the same group
foreign

04:29:13.969 --> 04:29:13.979 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:29:13.979 --> 04:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
foreign
Hall

04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
04:29:17.809 --> 04:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I have a question of
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
Representative cordelli so when taking
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
off the disabilities rights Center and
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
the parent information center you served
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
on this committee did you feel like they
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
weren't really influential in this
 
04:29:31.010 --> 04:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
committee they weren't necessary or
 
04:29:31.020 --> 04:29:31.910 align:start position:0%
committee they weren't necessary or
um

04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:33.410 --> 04:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
it depended on who the representatives
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes they were valuable and
 
04:29:43.969 --> 04:29:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
you could put it you could put it that
 
04:29:45.840 --> 04:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
you could put it you could put it that
way

04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.530 --> 04:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
regardless of who we put on this
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
cannot other people be called in to help
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
so those people who wanted to come in
 
04:30:01.010 --> 04:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
could still come in and give information
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
they just couldn't Vote or be part of
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
the Quorum or whatever is that correct
 
04:30:11.689 --> 04:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:13.610 --> 04:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes we we had
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
people coming and testifying giving
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
their opinions uh other than members yes
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
I once served on this uh group once
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
before years ago
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I found it quite a formative task
 
04:30:32.090 --> 04:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
one of which they always met in the
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon the day we had session
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
at four o'clock and you could never make
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
it down to Manchester to participate
 
04:30:40.849 --> 04:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
with the group that was one of the
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
problems I think they've tried to
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
rectify that but I can remember meeting
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
and it was just a room full Chuck full
 
04:30:52.370 --> 04:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
of people and it was not like this
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
committee which is smaller and you get
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
to know and and
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
what people represent I I just couldn't
 
04:31:01.130 --> 04:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
discern what groups they were
 
04:31:01.140 --> 04:31:02.510 align:start position:0%
discern what groups they were
representing

04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:31:04.130 --> 04:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
but the question I have for the
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee right now is that there's two
 
04:31:08.689 --> 04:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
differences I see within the bill one is
 
04:31:11.050 --> 04:31:11.060 align:start position:0%
going to one has kept the County
 
04:31:13.550 --> 04:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
correctional facility and the other has
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
gone with the State Correctional
 
04:31:15.120 --> 04:31:16.969 align:start position:0%
gone with the State Correctional
Facility

04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
Facility
 
04:31:19.550 --> 04:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
um my experience has been
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
that kids that students that come to the
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
or those that are put in for Corrections
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
at the county level and we do have a a
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
prosecutor here in our midst today
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the back share there but in the
 
04:31:39.889 --> 04:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
county that I was in we we had uh folks
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
that came from all at Corners Grafton
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
County and we'd have the in the
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent of Corrections would have
 
04:31:48.889 --> 04:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
to check to make sure that these people
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
had it for one had graduated from high
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
school two was there an IEP then you had
 
04:31:55.130 --> 04:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
to track down the community in which
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
they were from seeing oftentimes they
 
04:31:59.330 --> 04:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
are arrested in a different community
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
so that was quite a challenge in itself
 
04:32:03.410 --> 04:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
then you have to find people to instruct
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the IEP and so the
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
the I think there's a real task in far
 
04:32:13.969 --> 04:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
as County corrections as far as getting
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
this done and I think that's an asset
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
which I think that's uh would be needed
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
on this that's one area I'd make a
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
change to one of the Amendments uh so
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
and they in the County Corrections
 
04:32:30.769 --> 04:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
I'd like to also know how many folks on
 
04:32:33.769 --> 04:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
in County now are reading needing IEP
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
support we might be able to get that
 
04:32:37.370 --> 04:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
from Rebecca
 
04:32:41.570 --> 04:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
for that uh or somebody or doe I know
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
that our County Corrections load has
 
04:32:46.370 --> 04:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
gone from the new jail which we have up
 
04:32:48.110 --> 04:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
there which is a beautiful facility that
 
04:32:50.330 --> 04:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
Ray Burton was able to acquire the money
 
04:32:50.340 --> 04:32:51.229 align:start position:0%
Ray Burton was able to acquire the money
for

04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's built for 150 and we have about 47
 
04:32:57.530 --> 04:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
to 43 in it and
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
in other words well that that's good and
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
you know but a lot of the others now are
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
on a probationary type status where
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
they're not getting that service in
 
04:33:06.890 --> 04:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh and they've already dropped out of
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
school so there's I'd like to be able to
 
04:33:15.769 --> 04:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
capture these um these students somehow
 
04:33:17.570 --> 04:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
and I think that has to be
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
representation on this group
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair since this is not an early
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
so that there could be some work on
 
04:33:35.400 --> 04:33:37.609 align:start position:0%
so that there could be some work on
Amendment

04:33:37.609 --> 04:33:37.619 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
yes we can always recess this we have
 
04:33:42.890 --> 04:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
not taken the action as of this point so
 
04:33:42.900 --> 04:33:45.131 align:start position:0%
not taken the action as of this point so
uh

04:33:45.131 --> 04:33:45.141 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
represented dry
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can I ask a
 
04:33:54.890 --> 04:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
question on the homeschooled person just
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
looking at the definition
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
appreciated we usually are lumped in
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
together with private schools and and
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is a special exception but it's a
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
very narrow category I mean it says it
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't say family that's homeschooling
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
that has a disability so could it be
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
anyone that represents this group or
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
someone from a a home education Group
 
04:34:21.470 --> 04:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
which line are you looking at line eight
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
on the second page
 
04:34:26.570 --> 04:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
letter m
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.310 --> 04:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't recall
 
04:34:39.529 --> 04:34:39.539 align:start position:0%
um my time in the council who was
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
representing a homeschool Community
 
04:34:43.320 --> 04:34:43.970 align:start position:0%
representing a homeschool Community
um

04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:45.650 --> 04:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
but reading this
 
04:34:47.209 --> 04:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
04:34:50.810 --> 04:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
um it could be anyone in the family
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
okay follow up I'm not even reading
 
04:34:56.890 --> 04:34:56.900 align:start position:0%
family with what is here
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
representing yes okay
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
let me reiterate what I said there's so
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
many people in that room I didn't know
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
represent my way
 
04:35:12.289 --> 04:35:12.299 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and I would concur
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
with the idea of recessing this for more
 
04:35:17.330 --> 04:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
work but I do have a question for every
 
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
time cordelli I'm concerned about uh
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
items uh 27 through 30 on your Amendment
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
and the first page
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
because we have had
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
people here and not so much this year
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
but in the past from the disability
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
rights Center and specifically from the
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
parent information center since these
 
04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
are two groups
 
04:35:44.929 --> 04:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
who on a daily basis are dealing with
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
disability issues from families Etc and
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just perplexed on why they would
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
be uh you you eliminated them I normally
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
full while you're trying to cut some of
 
04:35:59.330 --> 04:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
the numbers down but they seem to mean
 
04:36:01.490 --> 04:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
it would be to have the expertise on
 
04:36:04.369 --> 04:36:04.379 align:start position:0%
some of these issues and so I just was
 
04:36:06.410 --> 04:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
interested in why they were eliminated
 
04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
from your proposal uh thank you
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the simple reason was that I don't
 
04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
they think that they were required under
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
id idea okay all right thank you yes
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lab
 
04:36:26.090 --> 04:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
I just wonder looking at the language in
 
04:36:27.890 --> 04:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
the federal law where number 11
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
representatives from the state Juvenile
 
04:36:32.929 --> 04:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
and adult corrections agencies
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
to me that satisfies the language
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
that I guess is there someone who who
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
puts this committee together or who
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
leads the group so that they would use
 
04:36:45.600 --> 04:36:47.209 align:start position:0%
leads the group so that they would use
their

04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know they're a knowledge base as to
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
recommending what agency should be
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
represented to make sure that the
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
students that are working on high school
 
04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
or whatnot I'm just curious as to who
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
leads that and would that serve that
 
04:37:06.051 --> 04:37:06.061 align:start position:0%
language serve what we're talking about
 
04:37:08.929 --> 04:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think there were differences
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
of opinion on how people were appointed
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee okay as a matter of
 
04:37:13.920 --> 04:37:15.429 align:start position:0%
to the committee okay as a matter of
fact

04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
fact
 
04:37:18.769 --> 04:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
the statute says appointed by the
 
04:37:21.410 --> 04:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
governor so in several instances of
 
04:37:23.689 --> 04:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
parents that I knew who were interested
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
I went to the governor's office and
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
asked for their appointment gave him
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
bios for the people and had them
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
appointed there are some on the council
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
who believe that
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um they basically should
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
um have veto power and review anyone who
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
wants to be on the
 
04:37:46.330 --> 04:37:46.340 align:start position:0%
um on the committee which I uh
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
find troubling personally
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
so I I you know
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
I I think that for me that was an issue
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:37:58.490 --> 04:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
so is there a chair of this advisory
 
04:38:02.631 --> 04:38:02.641 align:start position:0%
committee that would serve say two years
 
04:38:04.970 --> 04:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
so that they've got some sort of a
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know a structure in replacing
 
04:38:09.289 --> 04:38:09.299 align:start position:0%
membership and making sure they get the
 
04:38:11.090 --> 04:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
right memberships
 
04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
um at the um end of last year beginning
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
of this year they did appoint a new uh
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
chair for the committee and they do have
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
um a spreadsheet of a membership and
 
04:38:28.330 --> 04:38:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.470 --> 04:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
can can somebody tell me that for
 
04:38:42.890 --> 04:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
example on the cardelli amendment line
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
31 and assess it elsewhere too where you
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
have two individuals and now we're going
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
to make one is there any process for
 
04:38:51.890 --> 04:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
identifying which of the two is going to
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh flip a coin
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd decide but
 
04:39:01.799 --> 04:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd decide but
um actually

04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
um actually
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to look back and see
 
04:39:06.240 --> 04:39:07.250 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to look back and see
um if

04:39:07.250 --> 04:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
um if
 
04:39:08.929 --> 04:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
04:39:11.449 --> 04:39:11.459 align:start position:0%
um if these positions um are actually
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
filled at this point
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
um I think I do have a fairly recent
 
04:39:18.410 --> 04:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or it could get an updated
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
one to see yeah because we have the same
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
situation on line 21. yeah
 
04:39:23.641 --> 04:39:25.070 align:start position:0%
situation on line 21. yeah
so

04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
um that would be a
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
and if this goes in effect 60 days after
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
passage it means that that process is
 
04:39:33.650 --> 04:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
going to have to be somehow determined
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.850 --> 04:39:42.860 align:start position:0%
obviously we need some work on this
 
04:39:45.890 --> 04:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Hall
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again the representative
 
04:39:48.000 --> 04:39:49.368 align:start position:0%
thank you again the representative
cordelli

04:39:49.368 --> 04:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
04:39:52.368 --> 04:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
um line 21 you've reduced it from two to
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
one and it says to the special ed
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
teacher it doesn't say public school
 
04:39:57.410 --> 04:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
teacher just says special ed teacher
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
right yet on and then if you flip over
 
04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
and go from lines five to ten you've got
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
a private school you've got a charter
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
school you've got a homeschooled taking
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
three seats
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
versus the one seat on the front page
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
is that intentional or
 
04:40:17.690 --> 04:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
just the fact that the ones on the
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
second page for charter school private
 
04:40:23.090 --> 04:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
school and homeschool are all required
 
04:40:27.530 --> 04:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
further disrepresentative uh Milan thank
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
you I mean it may be obvious to others
 
04:40:35.650 --> 04:40:35.660 align:start position:0%
but what does this group do
 
04:40:35.660 --> 04:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
but what does this group do
[Laughter]

04:40:40.630 --> 04:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.640 --> 04:40:44.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
I don't mean that as a joke no no no no
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
I'm serious I don't know if this group
 
04:40:48.718 --> 04:40:52.070 align:start position:0%
I'm serious I don't know if this group
does

04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
um they are uh
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
well we can read the statute in statute
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
are their duties
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
um but I know that um
 
04:41:04.368 --> 04:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
the state plan that Rebecca Fredette has
 
04:41:05.630 --> 04:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
um often
 
04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
um where there are a number of criteria
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
this group has input into the state plan
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and um other Provisions that I can't
 
04:41:18.840 --> 04:41:20.330 align:start position:0%
um and um other Provisions that I can't
remember

04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:41:22.010 --> 04:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
um advising
 
04:41:24.890 --> 04:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
um uh the department on issues related
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
to children with special needs and their
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
education I think is uh primary so as a
 
04:41:33.530 --> 04:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up so it's basically an Advisory
 
04:41:36.050 --> 04:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
Group to the department would you say I
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
would say that okay thank you
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
I can recall when we had this we were
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with how we provide services
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
from the uh regular school to the
 
04:41:49.010 --> 04:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
charter school and there was a task
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
force put together an academic Bonnie
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
was on that and uh there was a report
 
04:41:56.930 --> 04:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
that was issued with a a laundry list of
 
04:41:59.208 --> 04:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
recommendations which impacted us as far
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
as legislation was concerned but it also
 
04:42:04.330 --> 04:42:04.340 align:start position:0%
was of importance to the department so
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
they are a group that can you know if we
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
need to do that type of study and
 
04:42:11.090 --> 04:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
research on special education issues
 
04:42:13.010 --> 04:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
that is a group we oftentimes have used
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
in the past and I'm talking now eight
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
years ago that I'm familiar with it
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.770 --> 04:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
just in response to what was asked
 
04:42:28.010 --> 04:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
earlier on the second page line one it
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
says one administrator of a public
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
special education program so there's the
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
public school being represented on the
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.920 --> 04:42:46.850 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:42:46.850 --> 04:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
think so rips and home about ready to
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
move forward here
 
04:42:55.010 --> 04:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:56.810 --> 04:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
um and I and I just want to respond to
 
04:42:58.250 --> 04:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
the department while they're all
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
involved right sure well sorry they're
 
04:43:02.330 --> 04:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
all in law well that's the point of an
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendment right so if they're all in law
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
that you could have been amended you
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
know you reduce two features to one
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so at least is my point but I do
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
think uh in response to representative
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
Lucas that administrator and teacher are
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
two separate but the first the teacher
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say public
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.288 --> 04:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
my Amendment simply changes two things
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
in this big big committee whereas
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's Amendment
 
04:43:36.410 --> 04:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
basically changes the whole committee
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
is important enough that we should have
 
04:43:45.530 --> 04:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
a time when we get input from maybe
 
04:43:49.128 --> 04:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
because we we didn't have testimony
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
um on on changing the whole committee
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
face of the whole committee
 
04:43:55.850 --> 04:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and I think these changes are pretty
 
04:43:58.390 --> 04:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
in his his Amendment are pretty
 
04:44:01.010 --> 04:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging and I I would certainly
 
04:44:02.810 --> 04:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
like to hear from some of the people
 
04:44:04.850 --> 04:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
that are on that committee whether they
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
um you know that this is the way to go
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
um okay let's try to think about
 
04:44:15.650 --> 04:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
procedure which we may follow to uh
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
first of all well we have two amendments
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing both and both seem
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
to have legitimate issues one is the the
 
04:44:25.970 --> 04:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
size of the the committee and then then
 
04:44:27.288 --> 04:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
we're all talking who's going to be on
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
it at this point in time I don't want to
 
04:44:32.770 --> 04:44:32.780 align:start position:0%
end this particular session right here
 
04:44:35.930 --> 04:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
with a Amendment already proposed I'd
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
like to have us withdraw this amendment
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
and have two amendments which we can
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
take to
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
either if we retain this bill we can
 
04:44:46.970 --> 04:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
study the bill and come up with solid
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations by November so we could
 
04:44:53.208 --> 04:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
then act on it then is this so critical
 
04:44:55.750 --> 04:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to have something done now
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
or would are having some time to put a
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
subcommittee together to look at this
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
issue through retaining it
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
and then move forward in November where
 
04:45:11.090 --> 04:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from the subcommittee
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative yeah uh Mr chair what's
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the floor right now is OTP
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
there's been no that's right we never
 
04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
there's no motion on either of these
 
04:45:22.610 --> 04:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's been no much you're free
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.208 --> 04:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
um looking at the statutes and I just
 
04:45:38.570 --> 04:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to take the lead of this
 
04:45:42.050 --> 04:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee and I know that individual
 
04:45:44.208 --> 04:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
districts are required by Statute to
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
have an individual
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
plan of their special ed program which
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a spin-off of the state
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
plan so I know that there has to be a
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
lot of input on that state plan but it
 
04:45:59.810 --> 04:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
would seem to me if that's the primary
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
role the statue says it's to advise the
 
04:46:04.730 --> 04:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education of issues
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
relating to special ed
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
why isn't the commissioner organizing
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
this group so that it is has Fair
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
representation of all the entities that
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
are required
 
04:46:16.368 --> 04:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and that's a
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee question that needs to be
 
04:46:21.170 --> 04:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
addressed and what are the duty specific
 
04:46:23.330 --> 04:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for this and who they
 
04:46:25.970 --> 04:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
report to and
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
Etc so we have a motion on the table
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
though to OTP this bill
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
so if we were to withdraw that motion
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then put something forward to retain
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
the bill then we can get resolution to
 
04:46:40.490 --> 04:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
both of these amendments and to the
 
04:46:42.170 --> 04:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
questions which we've had
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
who made the motion here I did
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
and who seconded
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
for me so would you be willing to just
 
04:46:53.090 --> 04:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
pull back your motion I would withdraw
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass motion yes represent
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
power now I would second that okay so so
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
you're we're both withdrawing so we have
 
04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
nothing on the table at this point in
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
time so how about a motion to retain
 
04:47:07.730 --> 04:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
so moved by representative cordelli
 
04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
second by Preston Tanner
 
04:47:10.620 --> 04:47:11.868 align:start position:0%
second by Preston Tanner
um

04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to that from the
 
04:47:16.128 --> 04:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
committee here I don't think we have to
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
take a a hand vote well we could
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
we could take it you've also be on the
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
record so maybe we ought to just do it
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
pardon me hand vote Yes we can do a hand
 
04:47:31.128 --> 04:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
vote on this so all those in favor of
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain the show with your
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
hand please anybody opposed good we're
 
04:47:37.610 --> 04:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
good so that's what we'll do with this
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
one and we'll put a subcommittee
 
04:47:40.020 --> 04:47:42.110 align:start position:0%
one and we'll put a subcommittee
together

04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be a 20 20 zip uh to uh look at
 
04:47:50.448 --> 04:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
this this whole situation uh I will you
 
04:47:52.128 --> 04:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
know get some members on that
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
immediately and I don't think this
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
deserves to committee the whole I think
 
04:47:58.970 --> 04:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
they can have it
 
04:47:58.980 --> 04:48:03.550 align:start position:0%
they can have it
foreign

04:48:03.550 --> 04:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
cordelli and represent Tanner on that
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
thing where it belongs and
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then rips and little you can be the
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
third member and we've got that thing
 
04:48:11.160 --> 04:48:11.930 align:start position:0%
third member and we've got that thing
done

04:48:11.930 --> 04:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:48:16.690 --> 04:48:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll I'll get the subcommittee
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
members when she's back here so I want
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%

04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
we haven't done uh
 
04:49:08.930 --> 04:49:08.940 align:start position:0%

that we had
 
04:55:36.000 --> 04:55:36.708 align:start position:0%
that we had
um

04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
the changes that are in the amendment
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
first of all is to include Charter
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
Public Schools in this uh so that that's
 
04:55:48.650 --> 04:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
one of the first ones and then down on
 
04:55:48.660 --> 04:55:50.030 align:start position:0%
one of the first ones and then down on
um

04:55:50.030 --> 04:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:51.890 --> 04:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:55:54.368 --> 04:55:54.378 align:start position:0%
down on line 21
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's changed it was twice
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
um yearly through second grade and it's
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.480 --> 04:56:07.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:10.610 --> 04:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
and then on the
 
04:56:13.970 --> 04:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
um what was changed
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
was an addition at line 14.
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
of a subparagraph
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
and this is probably the biggest change
 
04:56:30.650 --> 04:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
to the to the whole bill is that an
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%

04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
benchmarks for reading screenings using
 
04:56:42.590 --> 04:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based screening tools such as
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
diables or equivalent screening methods
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
for interventions at the school's
 
04:56:50.770 --> 04:56:50.780 align:start position:0%
discretion so what what this does is
 
04:56:50.780 --> 04:56:52.570 align:start position:0%
discretion so what what this does is
currently

04:56:52.570 --> 04:56:52.580 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
at third grade when the state assessment
 
04:56:59.230 --> 04:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
is done any student that's not
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
proficient at that point the school can
 
04:57:04.510 --> 04:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
then apply for a grant
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
per student which seems kind of by third
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
grade I was saying at lunch to somebody
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
if you haven't taught somebody to I was
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
a lifeguard if you haven't taught
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
somebody to swim by 16 it's very
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to get them to swim afterwards
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the same thing goes for reading if
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
they've spent the first three years
 
04:57:25.730 --> 04:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
really struggling or you know uh they
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
get to third grade and they still can't
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
read a lot as we heard in the testimony
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of negative
 
04:57:34.010 --> 04:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um things happen to them they think
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
they're stupid they
 
04:57:38.690 --> 04:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
um often um are falling back and other
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
things because reading is so essential
 
04:57:43.010 --> 04:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
to everything so my thought with that
 
04:57:45.288 --> 04:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
and actually it was kind of
 
04:57:47.570 --> 04:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
um copycat off uh representative
 
04:57:50.170 --> 04:57:50.180 align:start position:0%
cordelli's idea for his upcoming bill
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
that why not give money when when the
 
04:57:57.288 --> 04:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
reading problem is discovered so that
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
the money can be used then for
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
intervention right rather than wait till
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
third grade and kind of conglomerate
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
everybody together and just give money
 
04:58:06.890 --> 04:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
at that point so that's probably the
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
biggest change other than it applies to
 
04:58:21.310 --> 04:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.440 --> 04:58:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:33.000 --> 04:58:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:34.680 --> 04:58:36.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:58:39.410 --> 04:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes sorry
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that please and the
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
line 17 is that a thousand dollars
 
04:58:47.878 --> 04:58:49.788 align:start position:0%
line 17 is that a thousand dollars
annual

04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:58:55.010 --> 04:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh so it's it's part of the adequacy
 
04:58:58.128 --> 04:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
um right now it's just a one-time yeah
 
04:59:01.010 --> 04:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman yeah further
 
04:59:05.448 --> 04:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
04:59:09.288 --> 04:59:09.298 align:start position:0%
but thank you this is a this query
 
04:59:12.288 --> 04:59:12.298 align:start position:0%
deals with the actual funding
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
because one of the problems that we've
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
had with the reading program when this
 
04:59:19.128 --> 04:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
goes to finance
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
is that how do we know the thousand
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollars is in fact going for a reading
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
program and not going into some dark
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
hole in the School District budget
 
04:59:33.170 --> 04:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
so it it it's really a point of interest
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
of mine I I don't think you've addressed
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
this here as we have it in the 360 or
 
04:59:40.850 --> 04:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
the 600 whatever it was but it would
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
seem to me as we look at this bill
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some sense of the
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
receiving School having some
 
04:59:52.010 --> 04:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility of saying here's how
 
04:59:53.690 --> 04:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
here's the interventions that we're
 
04:59:56.330 --> 04:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
using for this thousand dollars to
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that students are in fact you
 
05:00:00.890 --> 05:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
that the district is committed to doing
 
05:00:02.448 --> 05:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
this because you are increasing the
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
amount of money here so it's more of a
 
05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
statement than really a question that
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about because if this goes
 
05:00:10.010 --> 05:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
if this goes to finance I can tell you
 
05:00:12.590 --> 05:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
right now uh representative Weiler is
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
going to be all over this because he's
 
05:00:16.610 --> 05:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
been all over it before and I think we
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
need to address the issue before it gets
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
to finance so that he can say oh you
 
05:00:23.810 --> 05:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
finally looked at this and there is some
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
sense of an intervention strategy to
 
05:00:27.770 --> 05:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
deal with children who do have this
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
reading problem
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr Mr chair was not a question
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
is yeah a comment it tell me
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
yes represent Ford
 
05:00:41.690 --> 05:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:00:43.810 --> 05:00:43.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm uh not experienced in this area at
 
05:00:49.970 --> 05:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
all so let me this is a naive question
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
but I noticed that these deadlines occur
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
at times like 30 days 60 days and so
 
05:00:59.930 --> 05:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
forth and I can't help but wonder what
 
05:01:02.330 --> 05:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
happens between those deadlines
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
what happens to the student is there any
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
intervening Catch net or something that
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
says okay we've identified a problem but
 
05:01:13.250 --> 05:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet decided what we're going
 
05:01:14.330 --> 05:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:01:16.610 --> 05:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
who holds the student's intellectual
 
05:01:21.170 --> 05:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
is that for me I guess yes um thank you
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
so down in line 27. on page one uh and
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is part of the original Bill the
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
school shall promptly inform the
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
students parents or legal guardian of
 
05:01:37.250 --> 05:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
the screening results is special ed
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
referral is made for further evaluation
 
05:01:42.170 --> 05:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
the state's required timeline shall be
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
followed but basically
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
um this this the point of this bill was
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
that when they're tested the parents are
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
notified an intervention start rather
 
05:01:52.980 --> 05:01:53.868 align:start position:0%
notified an intervention start rather
than

05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:01:55.730 --> 05:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
um okay let it delay
 
05:01:57.410 --> 05:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
um my reading didn't get me to the
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
second part that's why and that's
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
probably just because I don't understand
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
the system so
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cascadden
 
05:02:11.330 --> 05:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.770 --> 05:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
go for it
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:02:14.580 --> 05:02:15.230 align:start position:0%
is this
um

05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
just to help representative Ford Reading
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
instruction classroom in a regular
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
classroom instructions usually a
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of supports
 
05:02:26.930 --> 05:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
so the first tier is everyone gets the
 
05:02:29.448 --> 05:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
instruction and the teacher will screen
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
or assess or realize that there's a
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
group of children that didn't get it the
 
05:02:36.170 --> 05:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
first time so then there's extra
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
intervention provided to that secondary
 
05:02:38.340 --> 05:02:39.410 align:start position:0%
intervention provided to that secondary
tier

05:02:39.410 --> 05:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
tier
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
and then when there are kids that are
 
05:02:43.490 --> 05:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
not making it after so many weeks of
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
instruction because you can't determine
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
a disability a disorder or anything
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
unless your kids have been had some
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
sense of formalized instruction for a
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
period of maybe four to six weeks
 
05:02:57.770 --> 05:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
so that you know whether they can learn
 
05:02:59.810 --> 05:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
it or not and knowing that all children
 
05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
learn at different rates then you've got
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
the third tier ninety percent of the
 
05:03:05.448 --> 05:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
time that's a student that ends up being
 
05:03:08.330 --> 05:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
identified So within a regular classroom
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
which is a self-contained classroom it's
 
05:03:13.368 --> 05:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
a multi-tiered system of support so even
 
05:03:16.250 --> 05:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
if you screen all the students
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
a student is not going without
 
05:03:21.890 --> 05:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:24.170 --> 05:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
so that's an explanation of that the
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
other thing that I I question is
 
05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
the bill the current law says
 
05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten first grade and at
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate times
 
05:03:35.448 --> 05:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if you are testing
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
every single student K to three
 
05:03:42.170 --> 05:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
you're spending money on assessment
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
tools that are not necessary because
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a hundred percent
 
05:03:47.208 --> 05:03:47.218 align:start position:0%
of your kids
 
05:03:49.550 --> 05:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
that need that screening because they've
 
05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
already been monitored from say
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
kindergarten on through the grades and a
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
teacher will know
 
05:03:57.770 --> 05:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
who needs to be checked again who needs
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be checked again who needs more
 
05:03:59.520 --> 05:04:01.128 align:start position:0%
to be checked again who needs more
instruction

05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
05:04:03.650 --> 05:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I just question that
 
05:04:06.670 --> 05:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
um the other thing with the time limits
 
05:04:08.930 --> 05:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
if you have students that come into
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
first grade that have had no preschool
 
05:04:13.610 --> 05:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
or kindergarten experience chances are
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know that the teacher is going to be
 
05:04:18.170 --> 05:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
on that like a dog on a bone just
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
because you know they haven't had any
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
instruction yet and they need to be
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
exposed to it before so that you know
 
05:04:28.128 --> 05:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
whether they are learning or not in
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
terms of a time frame of 60 days so a
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
school calendar
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
if this relates to school days
 
05:04:38.208 --> 05:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
you have just about 60 days at the end
 
05:04:40.970 --> 05:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
of the end of November so November 30th
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
so I had 58 days in this year's school
 
05:04:43.980 --> 05:04:45.170 align:start position:0%
so I had 58 days in this year's school
calendar

05:04:45.170 --> 05:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
to November 30th so the law says no
 
05:04:50.090 --> 05:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
later than November 30th so the law
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
already meets that satisfaction unless
 
05:04:55.850 --> 05:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
it means calendar days now you're
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're accelerating the need for that
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
but your kids haven't had a good solid
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
I mean the beginning of school you're
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
teaching rules you know basic behaviors
 
05:05:08.690 --> 05:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then you start getting into the meat
 
05:05:10.850 --> 05:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
potatoes of instruction and kids need a
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
good six weeks of instruction to see how
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
they sort out
 
05:05:15.600 --> 05:05:16.670 align:start position:0%
they sort out
um

05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
and then the one initiating intervention
 
05:05:22.368 --> 05:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
within 21 days
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if there's a need for
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
that if there's someone in a tier two or
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
tier three they're either going to go
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
through a title one program support
 
05:05:31.730 --> 05:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
system or they have a reading specialist
 
05:05:33.410 --> 05:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
but I have concerned about small
 
05:05:34.970 --> 05:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
districts who don't have reading
 
05:05:34.980 --> 05:05:36.350 align:start position:0%
districts who don't have reading
specialists

05:05:36.350 --> 05:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
05:05:39.890 --> 05:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
so those are the concerns that I have
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I just and and coupled with that is
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
RSA 200 colon 60 which is reading
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
Specialists requirement says the
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Ed
 
05:05:52.610 --> 05:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
shall issue a request for proposal to
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
secure the contract Services of a
 
05:05:56.570 --> 05:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
reading specialist to enable the
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
department to provide school districts
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the support and resources necessary
 
05:06:04.610 --> 05:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
to assist students with dyslexia and
 
05:06:07.970 --> 05:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders and their families
 
05:06:10.490 --> 05:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know if that has occurred
 
05:06:13.250 --> 05:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
because to me that's the precursor to
 
05:06:13.260 --> 05:06:14.868 align:start position:0%
because to me that's the precursor to
this

05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:06:17.330 --> 05:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I just that's a question I don't know
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
if you know representative Tanner if
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:23.690 --> 05:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
um are we able to
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
ask the we we can ask and you know you
 
05:06:28.368 --> 05:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
talk about these timelines and all that
 
05:06:30.590 --> 05:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about some of
 
05:06:32.030 --> 05:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
this reading identification when you're
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
asking a kindergarten or first grade
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
teacher to give you a report by anytime
 
05:06:37.750 --> 05:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
in September
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
forget it you're not going to get it uh
 
05:06:44.810 --> 05:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
and so I that's part of the timeline
 
05:06:47.208 --> 05:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
concern I have on any kind of a bill
 
05:06:48.410 --> 05:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
05:06:50.930 --> 05:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh in reality you're not going to get it
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
done but um and this one right here
 
05:06:56.810 --> 05:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
the there's some lawyer terms here that
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
they love the word promptly what does
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
promptly mean
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's that could
 
05:07:05.448 --> 05:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
become a question you know you didn't
 
05:07:07.490 --> 05:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
notify me with one day or two day you
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
did it after 14 days is that promptly
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
well in some schools that may be really
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
early for a notification
 
05:07:16.730 --> 05:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
um then on on the top part there the
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
screen shall be repeated one additional
 
05:07:20.330 --> 05:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
time during the current school year so
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
the student comes in in April do you
 
05:07:25.250 --> 05:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
have to do it one more time after that
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me either
 
05:07:30.170 --> 05:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh and repeated a minimum twice yearly
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
through third grade there may be some
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
students that are in third grade they're
 
05:07:38.570 --> 05:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely having no problems they are
 
05:07:41.090 --> 05:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
reading now they are not even
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily do using your phonics to do
 
05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they may be just good vocabulary
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
comprehension type readers with fluency
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
right and and so I I I think what we're
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
sometimes doing is writing legislation
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's going to cover all ends which you
 
05:08:00.170 --> 05:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
can't do that the kids are different and
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
teaching is different and and some of
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
the policies for these timelines have to
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
be made locally
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
and in the classroom
 
05:08:12.890 --> 05:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with a specialist and and
 
05:08:15.050 --> 05:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative Caden are right we do not
 
05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
have and we're in my community they're
 
05:08:19.368 --> 05:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
reading teacher to help we don't have
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
the money for it and and you know in the
 
05:08:24.530 --> 05:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
Specialists whereas you have some school
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
districts have curriculum Specialists
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's an unknown in many of our small
 
05:08:30.530 --> 05:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
school districts in this state
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
so I'd be careful with the timeline
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
business and some of the vocabulary you
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
can't Define representative Cascade just
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
just a final to remember that you know
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make decisions in the
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
best interest of kids not what we want
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
but also to trust
 
05:08:50.090 --> 05:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
05:08:52.610 --> 05:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
because it does work and know that
 
05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
children are not carbon copies of each
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
other nor they all going to fit in the
 
05:09:01.730 --> 05:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
same box at the same time I mean there's
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
a wide spectrum of abilities
 
05:09:07.128 --> 05:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
and it takes some magic as Margaret
 
05:09:10.128 --> 05:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
would know to be able to juggle all of
 
05:09:12.770 --> 05:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
the abilities of children so that they
 
05:09:15.650 --> 05:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
all succeed so just want to keep that in
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
mind so thanks representative Cornell I
 
05:09:20.690 --> 05:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reinforce the thing about
 
05:09:23.930 --> 05:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
kindergarten because depending on where
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
you live when you enter kindergarten
 
05:09:28.490 --> 05:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
kids enter with very very different
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
skill sets even within like Manchester
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
depending on which area you're coming
 
05:09:35.810 --> 05:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
from I know one kindergarten teacher her
 
05:09:37.550 --> 05:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
students entered they didn't know their
 
05:09:39.650 --> 05:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
colors you know but then you have
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
another kitten kid well kindergarten in
 
05:09:44.090 --> 05:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
another part of the city they probably
 
05:09:45.890 --> 05:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
enter School reading because they've
 
05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
gone to preschool or or something else
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the other kids are sitting home
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
watching TV until it's time for
 
05:09:52.740 --> 05:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
watching TV until it's time for
kindergarten

05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we have to remember that too not
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
everybody's entering equal either you
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
know I recall what my wife said she was
 
05:10:02.690 --> 05:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
a first grade teacher up in Dillingham
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
Alaska which the only way you get there
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
is by plane there's no roads to it it's
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
Bush Alaska
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
and she had kids coming in that were oh
 
05:10:12.530 --> 05:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
just tremendous kids in terms of their
 
05:10:12.540 --> 05:10:13.610 align:start position:0%
just tremendous kids in terms of their
culture

05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
culture
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
when it came to some of this stuff right
 
05:10:15.360 --> 05:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
when it came to some of this stuff right
here

05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
and so you know again one shoe doesn't
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
fit all
 
05:10:24.170 --> 05:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
going over this side and then represent
 
05:10:24.180 --> 05:10:25.850 align:start position:0%

05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
Myler
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:27.840 --> 05:10:28.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
what we have to remember was what was
 
05:10:31.560 --> 05:10:32.628 align:start position:0%
what we have to remember was what was
the

05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:35.090 --> 05:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
one of the intents of this bill to begin
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
with is that dyslexic children tend to
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
be average and brighter
 
05:10:43.550 --> 05:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
and can hide and that was the point of
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
doing the multiple testing throughout
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
that whole time period is to catch those
 
05:10:50.040 --> 05:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
that whole time period is to catch those
who

05:10:51.050 --> 05:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
in classrooms seem to be doing fine but
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
aren't really they're just they've made
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
up tools to use for themselves they you
 
05:11:01.850 --> 05:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
know they're they're compensating and
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
that works until they hit that brick
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
wall and then you find out that they
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
can't and this was the whole point of
 
05:11:10.970 --> 05:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
this was to catch those kids before they
 
05:11:15.550 --> 05:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah mine is really a follow-up to um
 
05:11:20.810 --> 05:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner asking about the
 
05:11:20.820 --> 05:11:21.890 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner asking about the
status

05:11:21.890 --> 05:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
of the reading specialist out of the
 
05:11:27.770 --> 05:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
department do we know what the status of
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.128 --> 05:11:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Melissa light division
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
director for learner Support Department
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
of Education initially the reading
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
specialist contractor we were allocated
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars to contract with
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
the specialist to provide those Services
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the RSA
 
05:12:03.530 --> 05:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
we contracted with a person that was
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
doing that work for um as long as I've
 
05:12:07.850 --> 05:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
been at the department which has been
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
about uh three and a half years
 
05:12:12.530 --> 05:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
um since
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
I would say September I believe it was
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
we were able to hire on our Ela
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
education consultant that is does have
 
05:12:21.530 --> 05:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
all of meets all the qualifications and
 
05:12:23.208 --> 05:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
has all of the background to meet the
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
reading specialist
 
05:12:28.930 --> 05:12:28.940 align:start position:0%
um provision so we wanted to um
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
make a change in the legislation so that
 
05:12:34.250 --> 05:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
we could reflect that instead of having
 
05:12:36.530 --> 05:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
to contract that work out as outlined in
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
the RSA we'd have the ability to have
 
05:12:40.490 --> 05:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
somebody on staff that could provide a
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
lot of that that work
 
05:12:45.530 --> 05:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the contractor previously did all of
 
05:12:48.230 --> 05:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
the um put together all the resources
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
put together screeners and we have all
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
of that all those resources and supports
 
05:12:56.208 --> 05:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
available on our website in addition to
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
our learning management system all that
 
05:13:00.650 --> 05:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
can be accessed and there's
 
05:13:02.770 --> 05:13:02.780 align:start position:0%
um clarifications on the legislation
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
resources and supports specifically to
 
05:13:09.288 --> 05:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
meet that requirement and then our Ela
 
05:13:11.570 --> 05:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
specialist that is currently with the
 
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
Department is continuing on that work
 
05:13:16.990 --> 05:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
she's working on the lean into literacy
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
initiative where we're doing trainings
 
05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
across the state in Reading instruction
 
05:13:27.770 --> 05:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
in addition to looking at providing some
 
05:13:30.288 --> 05:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
supports at the uh in our teacher
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
education training programs and that so
 
05:13:34.368 --> 05:13:34.378 align:start position:0%
she is continuing to do the work that is
 
05:13:35.810 --> 05:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
outlined in that
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
but again with one person and a very
 
05:13:40.128 --> 05:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
very very small allocation to go towards
 
05:13:41.570 --> 05:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
that we're able to augment a little bit
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
with the federal funds to have her do
 
05:13:46.250 --> 05:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
that work but with just one person
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
um it's we're not able to have her
 
05:13:51.050 --> 05:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
providing supports to all of the schools
 
05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
so she's able to provide kind of a
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
higher level but not necessarily being
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
able to go in and do trainings at each
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
and every school across the state
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
because we just have that one other
 
05:14:04.730 --> 05:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up so is it part of the
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
Department's budget proposal to have
 
05:14:10.970 --> 05:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
that position full time rather than uh
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
having to contract it out I I think that
 
05:14:16.250 --> 05:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
if we were able to use an allocation to
 
05:14:18.410 --> 05:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
go towards even partially meeting half
 
05:14:19.970 --> 05:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
of that funding for that position I
 
05:14:21.170 --> 05:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
think that would help but currently
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's just the thirty thousand dollars
 
05:14:25.970 --> 05:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
that we are able to use so there's not a
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget item not at this time no okay
 
05:14:32.810 --> 05:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you president cardelli uh thank
 
05:14:35.570 --> 05:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
you um I do have a bill coming before us
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
that will
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
modify the reading specialist statute so
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't have to be a contract uh
 
05:14:43.320 --> 05:14:45.050 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't have to be a contract uh
situation

05:14:45.050 --> 05:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:14:46.730 --> 05:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't have an appropriation
 
05:14:49.550 --> 05:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
with it either but you know who knows we
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
can we can always mend things right I
 
05:14:53.208 --> 05:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
think having the flexibility is
 
05:14:55.550 --> 05:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
important because we have to look at
 
05:14:58.128 --> 05:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
what is the most um fiscally appropriate
 
05:15:01.550 --> 05:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
way to to get the services of an expert
 
05:15:04.010 --> 05:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
in that field we're very very lucky that
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
we just happen to hire an Eli specialist
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
that has all of the meets all those
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and has that specialty in
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
her background and if I may uh Mr chair
 
05:15:16.490 --> 05:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think one of the concerns we have is
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
that this committee and this legislative
 
05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
body has authorized like a nurse a nurse
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
coordinator they've authorized a
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
um a guidance person and yet they have
 
05:15:30.770 --> 05:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
those positions as they've been
 
05:15:33.288 --> 05:15:33.298 align:start position:0%
authorized by the by this legislative
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
body they have not been filled and
 
05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
followed up with by the department and
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
so that that's the point that's the
 
05:15:42.770 --> 05:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
concern that I have as we look at this
 
05:15:45.530 --> 05:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
important they're all important but in
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
this particular one that if we're going
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
to deal with having an individual that
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we as a group feel is appropriate
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
then I think it's it's incumbent upon
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department I'm not picking on you at
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
all but it's incumbent upon the
 
05:16:04.250 --> 05:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
department to recognize that and and to
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
move forward appropriately uh with the
 
05:16:08.750 --> 05:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
budget that's all thank you yeah would
 
05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
you like me to respond to the nurse
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
position because I can provide an update
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
if you would like so for the that
 
05:16:17.628 --> 05:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
particular position we had a difficulty
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
filling a position that was specific to
 
05:16:21.050 --> 05:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
that but we were able to hire an
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
administrator that has an MPA and she is
 
05:16:25.020 --> 05:16:25.670 align:start position:0%
administrator that has an MPA and she is
um

05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh able to I'm sorry in an mph a masters
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
in public health so she is um The Bureau
 
05:16:33.890 --> 05:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
administrator for wellness and nutrition
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
so she oversees that entire
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
um Bureau and that she's able to provide
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
05:16:42.530 --> 05:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um requirements as outlined in the in
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
05:16:45.410 --> 05:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
um to provide those services to the
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%

yes represent Belcher
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I wanted to speak
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
briefly to um
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
continue on with some testimony that we
 
05:16:59.930 --> 05:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
had heard previously especially from the
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
05:17:03.890 --> 05:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to how often we're
 
05:17:06.050 --> 05:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
doing this testing we heard testimony
 
05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
previously that the test itself is
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
obviously not perfect no test is there
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be some number that is a
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
false positive on this those students
 
05:17:17.930 --> 05:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
who were false positive on the test are
 
05:17:20.690 --> 05:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
then going to experience some degree of
 
05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
of diversion from the normal studies
 
05:17:24.890 --> 05:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
program as part of this
 
05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
um so I think what I'm getting at here
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
is there is there is an optimum number
 
05:17:32.690 --> 05:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
there has to be given the law of
 
05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
diminishing returns for how many and how
 
05:17:37.670 --> 05:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
frequently we're doing these tests
 
05:17:39.410 --> 05:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
because the more frequently and we do
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
them the less we're going to be
 
05:17:43.128 --> 05:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
capturing actual dyslexia the more we're
 
05:17:45.350 --> 05:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
going to be capturing false positives
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we actually know what
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
that number is because if we go too far
 
05:17:52.730 --> 05:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
over that number we can't say with any
 
05:17:54.770 --> 05:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
certainty that we're actually doing more
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
good than harm in the in the educational
 
05:17:57.840 --> 05:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
good than harm in the in the educational
cycle

05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.770 --> 05:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
reps and cascad
 
05:18:04.970 --> 05:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:06.530 --> 05:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
um going back to the statute on the
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
reading specialist again there is a
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
section in the other talks about the
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner will submit a report about
 
05:18:14.690 --> 05:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of the work of the
 
05:18:16.910 --> 05:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
reading specialist uh to make sure it's
 
05:18:18.650 --> 05:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
complying with all the requirements and
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
and that it would give he would give a
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
copy of that report to the Speaker of
 
05:18:26.690 --> 05:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
the House the Senate President the chair
 
05:18:28.850 --> 05:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
people the chairperson of the House and
 
05:18:31.010 --> 05:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
Senate education committees and the
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
governor no later than November 1st 2018
 
05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
and annually thereafter so I'm wondering
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
if you were you have received such a
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
report in the fall and that might help
 
05:18:44.990 --> 05:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
us know how are things going in
 
05:18:45.000 --> 05:18:46.910 align:start position:0%
us know how are things going in
specifics

05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
05:18:48.770 --> 05:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
um as part of this discussion
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
reports are filed by the the
 
05:18:53.208 --> 05:18:53.218 align:start position:0%
commissioner and we do get them here you
 
05:18:56.570 --> 05:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
do okay yes we get them in bullying we
 
05:18:58.610 --> 05:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
get them on various types of activities
 
05:19:01.070 --> 05:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
that the required to report to us we do
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
get those reports okay you're right most
 
05:19:05.650 --> 05:19:05.660 align:start position:0%
of them come in during the summer okay
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
our our late late spring yeah okay so
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
there would have been a summary report
 
05:19:14.690 --> 05:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
of how the contracted service has worked
 
05:19:17.090 --> 05:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
thus far yeah we can we can we can look
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
but you know I know there's a number of
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
reports which we don't receive could you
 
05:19:23.570 --> 05:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
be able to I provided that report before
 
05:19:23.580 --> 05:19:24.970 align:start position:0%
be able to I provided that report before
November

05:19:24.970 --> 05:19:24.980 align:start position:0%
November
 
05:19:29.868 --> 05:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Tanner where so as
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee members where where would we
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
go to find those reports
 
05:19:34.138 --> 05:19:37.250 align:start position:0%
go to find those reports
online

05:19:37.250 --> 05:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.170 --> 05:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be probably wise of going
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
right to doe to get them because
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
oftentimes those reports come here and
 
05:19:43.850 --> 05:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
they're provided to us they're provided
 
05:19:47.090 --> 05:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
to the various people that are required
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
by stats to be notified but then they
 
05:19:52.490 --> 05:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
are parked somewhere on a desk whereas
 
05:19:54.890 --> 05:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
if you well truthfully yeah they've got
 
05:19:56.330 --> 05:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
to be filed somewhere
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
and and and so the best place to get it
 
05:20:00.650 --> 05:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
is inquire directly to the department
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
and they can get those reports it's just
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
like the other day we had a question
 
05:20:08.570 --> 05:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
regarding the reports of the efas and
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
that scholarship organization the
 
05:20:13.128 --> 05:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
reports have been submitted
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's just that somewhere after submittal
 
05:20:17.628 --> 05:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
that that's where all the confusion
 
05:20:17.638 --> 05:20:20.330 align:start position:0%
that that's where all the confusion
starts

05:20:20.330 --> 05:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.208 --> 05:20:23.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni um yes
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
concerning those reports just as a new
 
05:20:24.958 --> 05:20:25.850 align:start position:0%
concerning those reports just as a new
member

05:20:25.850 --> 05:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
member
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um not knowing where all that
 
05:20:28.970 --> 05:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
information is and to hear that it's
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
been filed somewhere you'll be extremely
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
helpful whether it's an internal I mean
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know where you publish that
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
information but it certainly would help
 
05:20:40.010 --> 05:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
me in understanding you know all these
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
um all these issues that are coming up
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you unfortunately see they send
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
it usually to the chair chairs change
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
the legislators come and they go and all
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
this other so it's it's just
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
I guess the whole system that's
 
05:20:58.610 --> 05:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
rethought as far as how can that be put
 
05:21:00.410 --> 05:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
out to the committee and then in the
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
fall committee members in the beginning
 
05:21:04.670 --> 05:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
of binding all change here we are now
 
05:21:07.730 --> 05:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
with uh half this committee is brand new
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so with that you obviously haven't
 
05:21:12.530 --> 05:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
seen those reports we have communicated
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of those other reports copies will
 
05:21:16.250 --> 05:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
be made I know Jennifer makes copies of
 
05:21:17.448 --> 05:21:17.458 align:start position:0%
some of those and they're handed out to
 
05:21:20.570 --> 05:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
committee members uh what goes on after
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
05:21:25.850 --> 05:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
yeah represent cardelli thank you
 
05:21:28.910 --> 05:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a step back if I might
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
um if you remember HB 437 was a larger
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
reading literacy initiative what I did
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
was I Incorporated
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
377 into that bill in an amendment and
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
based on the hearing I have gone back
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
and drafted an additional Amendment not
 
05:21:52.670 --> 05:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
submitted yet to OLS
 
05:21:55.250 --> 05:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
but what I did was
 
05:21:55.260 --> 05:21:56.208 align:start position:0%
but what I did was
um

05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
provided the the reading
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
um incentive Grant uh program which was
 
05:22:05.208 --> 05:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
in the original bill for the third grade
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
I made it for the second and third grade
 
05:22:12.970 --> 05:22:12.980 align:start position:0%
um because I think in order for
 
05:22:15.230 --> 05:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
Grants to be made there's going to be
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to be made on a common product
 
05:22:21.650 --> 05:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I also added that the department
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
would identify a contract with a
 
05:22:24.718 --> 05:22:25.930 align:start position:0%
would identify a contract with a
universal

05:22:25.930 --> 05:22:25.940 align:start position:0%
universal
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
literacy and dyslexia screening product
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
I worked with the Amplified people who
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
make Dibbles to incorporate some um
 
05:22:38.690 --> 05:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
measures of what that product should
 
05:22:38.700 --> 05:22:40.490 align:start position:0%
measures of what that product should
include

05:22:40.490 --> 05:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I added the charter schools
 
05:22:46.368 --> 05:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
05:22:46.378 --> 05:22:46.990 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
um

05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:49.490 --> 05:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
speaking to that Universal screener that
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
the department would get
 
05:22:54.050 --> 05:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I added an appropriation to the bill
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the Department to acquire that
 
05:22:58.750 --> 05:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
screener for use Statewide
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
and in in relation to the thousand
 
05:23:04.610 --> 05:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
dollar reading Improvement Grants
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
um the bill does require a report from
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
the district
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
outlining the plan on how the district
 
05:23:13.610 --> 05:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
intends to use the grant award funds to
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
offer into intensive reading
 
05:23:19.490 --> 05:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
intervention programs so hopefully that
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
will provide some a measure of how those
 
05:23:24.530 --> 05:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
funds are being used to actually help
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
kids rather than the differentiated aid
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
grant which just goes into a black hole
 
05:23:33.128 --> 05:23:33.138 align:start position:0%
if you will and this reading Improvement
 
05:23:36.530 --> 05:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
Grant replaces
 
05:23:40.010 --> 05:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the um differentiated Aid it'll cost
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but it does replace
 
05:23:42.000 --> 05:23:43.730 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but it does replace
that

05:23:43.730 --> 05:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:43.740 --> 05:23:44.690 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:23:44.690 --> 05:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm taking a different
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
broader scope approach to this
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
um by trying to include dyslexia
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
um as well as literacy because it's all
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
based on a screener and looking at
 
05:24:05.330 --> 05:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
deficiencies also in my discussions with
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
um the amplify dipples people they have
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
a product above Dibbles
 
05:24:15.550 --> 05:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
um includes Dibbles but also
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
identifies and it's meant to be teacher
 
05:24:18.360 --> 05:24:19.788 align:start position:0%
identifies and it's meant to be teacher
given

05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
um at the district level uh it
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
identifies the deficiencies and also
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
provides recommendations on
 
05:24:28.190 --> 05:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
interventions to correct those
 
05:24:32.448 --> 05:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and has a patient excuse me
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
I keep doing that apparent portal
 
05:24:38.090 --> 05:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh because one of the requirements is
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the bill for uh is for Parental
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
notification and follow up with the
 
05:24:44.770 --> 05:24:44.780 align:start position:0%
parents and this
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
dashboard would help accomplish that
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
without any additional work on the
 
05:24:52.368 --> 05:24:52.378 align:start position:0%
district level I think
 
05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I'm trying to do in
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
437 I passed a couple of copies around
 
05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to get a feel for the
 
05:25:06.410 --> 05:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
um the effort from the committee before
 
05:25:09.650 --> 05:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
submitting this again another amendment
 
05:25:13.610 --> 05:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
to the bill to OLS for drafting
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
um but that's what my intention is in uh
 
05:25:22.368 --> 05:25:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:24.890 --> 05:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
further represent luno
 
05:25:26.750 --> 05:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and I don't
 
05:25:28.610 --> 05:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
mean to dwell on this point but I'm sure
 
05:25:30.890 --> 05:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
you didn't mean to say that adequacy
 
05:25:35.770 --> 05:25:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.930 --> 05:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
well that's a that's an adequacy Grant
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and and and
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't go into a black hole I
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
think probably what you what you meant
 
05:25:47.208 --> 05:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
is that districts can use those funds as
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
they see fit and they certainly report
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
back out on them in detail in the doe 25
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
right and it goes into a black hole as
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
far as knowing whether that money and
 
05:26:00.770 --> 05:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's 1.7 million dollars a year actually
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
goes to help kids with their reading no
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
I I I I agree with that right districts
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
can use it as it sees fit it's a it's
 
05:26:09.770 --> 05:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
General attic part of General adequacy
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
funding so thanks
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the coin you know
 
05:26:15.530 --> 05:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
1.7 million dollars spread over this
 
05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
entire State you know if you look at the
 
05:26:19.850 --> 05:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're fighting in the
 
05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for reading is
 
05:26:25.550 --> 05:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
minuscule and it's you only receive it
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
if you're not qualifying for the other
 
05:26:30.110 --> 05:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
three categories so special education
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
are differentiated eight which are the
 
05:26:34.010 --> 05:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
special education free and reduced in
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
English language learner
 
05:26:35.638 --> 05:26:37.070 align:start position:0%
English language learner
so

05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:37.080 --> 05:26:38.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:40.730 --> 05:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
if we were requiring accountability and
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
I've tried to do that in the past uh it
 
05:26:45.650 --> 05:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
would spend more money trying to get the
 
05:26:47.570 --> 05:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
accountability report then we're sending
 
05:26:49.610 --> 05:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
the district for you know improving
 
05:26:49.620 --> 05:26:51.530 align:start position:0%
the district for you know improving
ratings

05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
ratings
 
05:26:51.540 --> 05:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
ratings
so

05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:52.560 --> 05:26:53.930 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

05:26:53.930 --> 05:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:26:56.330 --> 05:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
further yes represent woodcock
 
05:26:58.490 --> 05:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman just to follow up on
 
05:27:01.128 --> 05:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
representative balboni's uh question doe
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the last report that the according to
 
05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
the the regulation the last report that
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
the commission's office should have
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
generated would have been November 22.
 
05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
as a possible for our you to request
 
05:27:13.260 --> 05:27:22.208 align:start position:0%
as a possible for our you to request
copies

05:27:22.208 --> 05:27:22.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:25.250 --> 05:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
we can just get one report we get it we
 
05:27:26.810 --> 05:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
give it the job first she makes multiple
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
copies we all have some based on the
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
same information yes I provided the
 
05:27:32.810 --> 05:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
report before November 1st and I can
 
05:27:35.330 --> 05:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
resend that thank you sure
 
05:27:37.128 --> 05:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine
 
05:27:38.930 --> 05:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
 
05:27:38.940 --> 05:27:40.610 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of the
department

05:27:40.610 --> 05:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:27:44.090 --> 05:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:48.530 --> 05:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
so we're back to the that the bill at
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.840 --> 05:28:02.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:28:02.330 --> 05:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
05:28:14.208 --> 05:28:14.218 align:start position:0%
on uh 377 the amendment yes
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
um am I correcting the both 377 and 437
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.128 --> 05:28:46.138 align:start position:0%
for I'm sorry 437
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
my mistake for 437 is an early bill yeah
 
05:28:50.458 --> 05:29:02.410 align:start position:0%
my mistake for 437 is an early bill yeah
foreign

05:29:02.410 --> 05:29:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have over 40 bills with FNS on it we
 
05:29:07.970 --> 05:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
have 16 early bills
 
05:29:07.980 --> 05:29:14.750 align:start position:0%
have 16 early bills
um

05:29:14.750 --> 05:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.090 --> 05:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know that the the second was not an
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
early right not an early bill so one of
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.100 --> 05:29:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:29:27.470 --> 05:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:29:32.208 --> 05:29:32.218 align:start position:0%
um once you put that extra thousand
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
dollars and whatever that kind of makes
 
05:29:37.610 --> 05:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
377 if we amend it with this amendment
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
also an early Bill and is there a
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
problem with no it does not no it
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it doesn't even though we
 
05:29:46.970 --> 05:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
add the money we can put a million
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
million dollars on the thing and it's
 
05:29:52.490 --> 05:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
not something our question is can we
 
05:29:57.288 --> 05:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
just recess 377 until we are talking
 
05:29:57.298 --> 05:29:58.970 align:start position:0%
just recess 377 until we are talking
about

05:29:58.970 --> 05:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
the other one for 437 and then look at
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
them both together at that point since
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
they're since we may be amending two
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
into one if that's what we decide to do
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
looking at both bills we've got to make
 
05:30:22.910 --> 05:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
sure the intent of both bills is
 
05:30:25.330 --> 05:30:25.340 align:start position:0%
closely linked
 
05:30:28.250 --> 05:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to I'm looking at the
 
05:30:31.128 --> 05:30:31.138 align:start position:0%
intent on on 377 here the screening of
 
05:30:34.368 --> 05:30:34.378 align:start position:0%
intervention and the other one is you're
 
05:30:36.650 --> 05:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
building it uh yes
 
05:30:39.010 --> 05:30:39.020 align:start position:0%
um or I can um
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
if for 37. if you'll give me more I have
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
copies of my amendment that includes
 
05:30:47.930 --> 05:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
my edition of 377 not the rest that we
 
05:30:49.730 --> 05:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
just talked about yeah yeah but I have
 
05:30:57.530 --> 05:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.330 --> 05:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know they're both dealing with
 
05:31:00.850 --> 05:31:00.860 align:start position:0%
similar topics
 
05:31:03.948 --> 05:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
so they could be joined into one bill
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's no question there
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
um I I think I would throw out the
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
caution here though that
 
05:31:14.570 --> 05:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
for us sometimes it's easy to write
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
statutory language but we got to also
 
05:31:20.330 --> 05:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that the statutory language we
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
write with all its timelines and
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility gels with reality
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
by that I mean gels with what's going on
 
05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
in the grade schools
 
05:31:30.180 --> 05:31:31.610 align:start position:0%
in the grade schools
and

05:31:31.610 --> 05:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:33.530 --> 05:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I know the intent is to make sure
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's reading and we get kids
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
reading but to do that I caution on one
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
shoe fits all it's it's something you've
 
05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
got to be very careful there are some
 
05:31:47.570 --> 05:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
schools that probably are using other
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
programs to try to accomplish this there
 
05:31:52.128 --> 05:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
are some schools that you know teach
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
reading differently than another and
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
there's no set protocol for the state if
 
05:31:58.570 --> 05:31:58.580 align:start position:0%
we do something like this
 
05:32:01.368 --> 05:32:01.378 align:start position:0%
yes there's some benefits to it
 
05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh but there's also some going to be
 
05:32:06.410 --> 05:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
some casualties
 
05:32:09.288 --> 05:32:09.298 align:start position:0%
so represent cascadden
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for making that point
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
definitely we want kids to read and
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
definitely we want to be able to support
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever uh can help support the
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
districts in that process I caution
 
05:32:22.970 --> 05:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
about recommending any one particular
 
05:32:22.980 --> 05:32:24.890 align:start position:0%
about recommending any one particular
tool

05:32:24.890 --> 05:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
tool
 
05:32:28.850 --> 05:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
because to me that's not our role
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
to do that whether the state provides
 
05:32:33.830 --> 05:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the funding or not and yes I've been
 
05:32:35.810 --> 05:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
trained in Dibbles and I don't discredit
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
what you can get from it but I know that
 
05:32:40.670 --> 05:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
there have school there are schools that
 
05:32:43.010 --> 05:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
have also used star
 
05:32:45.288 --> 05:32:45.298 align:start position:0%
and are using a different version of
 
05:32:47.330 --> 05:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
Dibbles to get to the same information
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I worry about us sitting here making
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
a decision on a tool when we're not
 
05:32:55.368 --> 05:32:55.378 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists and we don't you
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
know we don't really know what a child
 
05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
might need and I think that's up to the
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
local school district but definitely if
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
we can put our heads together I like the
 
05:33:06.410 --> 05:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
suggestion of Representative Lucas to
 
05:33:08.690 --> 05:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
look at both bills together to see what
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
we can do to strengthen reading
 
05:33:10.080 --> 05:33:11.208 align:start position:0%
we can do to strengthen reading
instruction

05:33:11.208 --> 05:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh for our kids
 
05:33:16.128 --> 05:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh yes I didn't mean
 
05:33:21.170 --> 05:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
to imply that my draft would require any
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
one product it would be based on an
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation and contract by the
 
05:33:28.730 --> 05:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I feel that if we are going to
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
award grant money based on proficiency
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
level that you have to have a base it on
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.610 --> 05:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
yeah our district also used star math
 
05:33:45.050 --> 05:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
star reading
 
05:33:47.330 --> 05:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh that there is
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to this if you look back
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
over the years in education we've gone
 
05:33:54.890 --> 05:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
through many swings the pendulum in
 
05:33:57.770 --> 05:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
education and every time we make a swing
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
we think we've got the answer then we
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
swing back and we go from uh inquiry
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
science do we go to Modern math
 
05:34:06.590 --> 05:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
mathematics we go to no walls we go to
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
walls we go to all over the place and
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
every time we make these changes in
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
these moves
 
05:34:15.948 --> 05:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
we're we're messing with education and
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
to the point where we're taking that
 
05:34:20.510 --> 05:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
local thread away which is fit to their
 
05:34:22.250 --> 05:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
particular community and as a result of
 
05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
their local board and their teachers
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
working cooperatively together so it's a
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
challenge uh we know we've got to try to
 
05:34:33.170 --> 05:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
improve in some areas but the we is
 
05:34:34.850 --> 05:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
going to have to be the local school
 
05:34:34.860 --> 05:34:36.650 align:start position:0%
going to have to be the local school
district

05:34:36.650 --> 05:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to be from this level
 
05:34:42.288 --> 05:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
right here we can say hey we emphasize
 
05:34:44.690 --> 05:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
that you do this we we want to see
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
something change but it but we
 
05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I would I would suggest you
 
05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
all go down and get in the kindergarten
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
room go down get in the first grade room
 
05:34:57.650 --> 05:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
and and see what's going on they're all
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying everything you need to know in
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
life is taught in the kindergarten well
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
and and so you know I you know so please
 
05:35:09.650 --> 05:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
you know before we go with both these
 
05:35:12.770 --> 05:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
bills and try to you know we got to be
 
05:35:15.288 --> 05:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
careful be really careful where we're
 
05:35:17.208 --> 05:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
going that's coming from my experiences
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
as an elementary teacher and Elementary
 
05:35:18.958 --> 05:35:20.448 align:start position:0%
as an elementary teacher and Elementary
principal

05:35:20.448 --> 05:35:20.458 align:start position:0%
principal
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I it was it really it's a challenge
 
05:35:27.170 --> 05:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
it's a fun job but it's it's very you
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
know 16 little guys in a classroom in
 
05:35:31.010 --> 05:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
the first grade is like having a whole
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
Army in a classroom
 
05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
and it takes a lot of work a lot of work
 
05:35:40.190 --> 05:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I can remember when I was a fourth
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
grade teacher back then in those days it
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
was 25 28 kids maybe 30 kids in the
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
classroom and they came down with this
 
05:35:48.830 --> 05:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
program called Fountain Valley
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
and we had to and fountains still around
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
some of the products but at any rate we
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
had to identify what we were doing in
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
Reading in terms of every darn fanatic
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
skill you can believe we had to track
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
all the Blends the digraphs the constant
 
05:36:05.810 --> 05:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
short or the constants and the Blends
 
05:36:09.170 --> 05:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
and and the vowels short and long and
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
all the all the other uh Associated
 
05:36:13.490 --> 05:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
skills both in comprehension and
 
05:36:13.500 --> 05:36:14.690 align:start position:0%
skills both in comprehension and
vocabulary

05:36:14.690 --> 05:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
vocabulary
 
05:36:18.288 --> 05:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
I spent most of my day managing those
 
05:36:18.298 --> 05:36:19.730 align:start position:0%
I spent most of my day managing those
charts

05:36:19.730 --> 05:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
charts
 
05:36:22.550 --> 05:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and every time you make a teacher do
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
that you're subtracting from the
 
05:36:26.330 --> 05:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
instructional time and the real benefit
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
that that teacher is in that room for so
 
05:36:30.650 --> 05:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
I caution I put that caution I think
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
what we will do is we will recess not
 
05:36:34.490 --> 05:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
take any action on this and we'll try to
 
05:36:36.650 --> 05:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
blend the two bills together
 
05:36:41.530 --> 05:36:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah see and we're going to have to we
 
05:36:45.948 --> 05:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
can't keep putting off these early bills
 
05:36:47.930 --> 05:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to do it we're
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
getting into February
 
05:36:53.208 --> 05:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
and so when we do the force that's on
 
05:36:55.490 --> 05:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
Monday so we could also note this one to
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
be heard on uh you know exact on Monday
 
05:37:00.770 --> 05:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'll have to work around these rules
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
with with our clerk make sure I do
 
05:37:04.730 --> 05:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
things right Jennifer keep me in line
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
here will you please I'll do it my way
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
if anything that's not going to work
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that means we've recessed what three
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
bills today
 
05:37:21.230 --> 05:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to get those on the docket
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
in the proper locations so that we can
 
05:37:25.550 --> 05:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
do it with the other bills yes represent
 
05:37:28.550 --> 05:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
cascadden I'm sorry is the intent of the
 
05:37:30.610 --> 05:37:30.620 align:start position:0%
Bell to replace the current
 
05:37:35.570 --> 05:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh reading in the disparity Aid would
 
05:37:37.368 --> 05:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
this replace it
 
05:37:39.890 --> 05:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
because right now it's um what is that
 
05:37:43.010 --> 05:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
700 or something per child if they are
 
05:37:45.410 --> 05:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
reading below grade level by the end of
 
05:37:48.650 --> 05:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
third grade or by third grade and and I
 
05:37:50.810 --> 05:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
believe are they using the New Hampshire
 
05:37:59.690 --> 05:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
with the uh could you could you repeat
 
05:38:02.580 --> 05:38:03.890 align:start position:0%
with the uh could you could you repeat
yeah

05:38:03.890 --> 05:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
so a thousand dollars per student yes
 
05:38:09.410 --> 05:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
right okay so is that to replace the
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid category of students
 
05:38:14.330 --> 05:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
reading below grade level and do they
 
05:38:16.850 --> 05:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
use the New Hampshire State assessment
 
05:38:19.128 --> 05:38:19.138 align:start position:0%
for that measure because all third
 
05:38:21.650 --> 05:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
graders take the state assessment that
 
05:38:23.810 --> 05:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
was in my original bill at what you
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
state yeah in my new Amendment
 
05:38:26.760 --> 05:38:27.430 align:start position:0%
state yeah in my new Amendment
um

05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the differentiated Aid is still
 
05:38:33.288 --> 05:38:33.298 align:start position:0%
eliminated and replaced by this reading
 
05:38:35.448 --> 05:38:35.458 align:start position:0%
Improvement Grant okay
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the grant would be given in the
 
05:38:43.150 --> 05:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
second and third grades
 
05:38:43.160 --> 05:38:44.990 align:start position:0%
second and third grades
so

05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:48.530 --> 05:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
um in order to have a common base for
 
05:38:52.448 --> 05:38:52.458 align:start position:0%
warning of that Grant I suggested the
 
05:38:55.368 --> 05:38:55.378 align:start position:0%
state purchased screener would be used
 
05:38:58.128 --> 05:38:58.138 align:start position:0%
and then we could uh see where
 
05:39:00.470 --> 05:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
proficiency work levels were based on a
 
05:39:03.050 --> 05:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
common platform okay that makes that
 
05:39:04.970 --> 05:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
makes sense I I understand now why
 
05:39:06.530 --> 05:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
you're talking Universal screener
 
05:39:08.330 --> 05:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
because they they all have to take the
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
same right to get the comparison yes so
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
that would replace that category of just
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
disparity right and that 1.7 million
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
would fold up let's say to the uh the
 
05:39:21.410 --> 05:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
new level
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
um and um I was able to get any numbers
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education about
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the number of
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
um deficient
 
05:39:34.730 --> 05:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
um second and third grade readers but
 
05:39:37.610 --> 05:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
what I did look at was uh the second and
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
third grade enrollment which is about 12
 
05:39:44.090 --> 05:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
000 students per grade level
 
05:39:46.368 --> 05:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:39:49.310 --> 05:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
um look at proficiency levels which are
 
05:39:52.250 --> 05:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
generally around 50 percent in Reading
 
05:39:55.368 --> 05:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
at the state level so that's
 
05:39:58.250 --> 05:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I took that then multiplied that by a
 
05:40:01.970 --> 05:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per deficient reader to
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
get in a ballpark idea of what the cost
 
05:40:08.810 --> 05:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
so what was your ballpark figure six
 
05:40:11.940 --> 05:40:14.270 align:start position:0%
so what was your ballpark figure six
million

05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:40:17.090 --> 05:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
um uh per year yeah that's what I
 
05:40:18.650 --> 05:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
calculate right there reporting moments
 
05:40:18.660 --> 05:40:19.610 align:start position:0%
calculate right there reporting moments
uh

05:40:19.610 --> 05:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
um six million losing your fingers you
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
just mention right six million second
 
05:40:27.770 --> 05:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
grade yeah and six million third grade
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:36.480 --> 05:40:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
boy

05:40:37.850 --> 05:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
boy
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
buy myself a Cadillac with that
 
05:40:40.920 --> 05:40:43.070 align:start position:0%
buy myself a Cadillac with that
okay

05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:40:45.288 --> 05:40:45.298 align:start position:0%
alrighty so I guess we're at the end of
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
the day on all this uh um so what we
 
05:40:50.690 --> 05:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
will do is that we have no more bills to
 
05:40:52.850 --> 05:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
exec today so we're going to end this
 
05:40:54.410 --> 05:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
05:40:56.510 --> 05:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll take these three bills and
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
hook them on to an exact session at a
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
time which is best with the other bills
 
05:41:03.550 --> 05:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
that we'll have to put in the calendar
 
05:41:06.110 --> 05:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for all in the audience of
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
waiting through all this
 
05:41:11.090 --> 05:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
right and tell Jerry fruit he must have
 
05:41:18.288 --> 05:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
yes can you repeat what bills that we
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay the bills which we are going to be
 
05:41:46.368 --> 05:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
coming up with and putting in 272 that's
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
the funding of the charter school upping
 
05:41:50.990 --> 05:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
05:41:52.200 --> 05:41:53.170 align:start position:0%
um and then
um

05:41:53.170 --> 05:41:53.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
577 that is the catastrophic Aid 3.5
 
05:41:57.360 --> 05:41:58.730 align:start position:0%
577 that is the catastrophic Aid 3.5
deal

05:41:58.730 --> 05:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
deal
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the one we just addressed which was
 
05:42:06.650 --> 05:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh 377 the dyslexia
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
and of course the other bills which we
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
were discussing are already on the
 
05:42:14.090 --> 05:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
agenda for our executive session
 
05:42:16.490 --> 05:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
next week so what I will do is I'll look
 
05:42:18.050 --> 05:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
at and try and hook them on to the same
 
05:42:18.060 --> 05:42:18.770 align:start position:0%
at and try and hook them on to the same
day

05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:42:20.510 --> 05:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
but what we've got to be very careful is
 
05:42:23.570 --> 05:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
when we're reviewing these uh we look at
 
05:42:25.490 --> 05:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
all the read them over and if you have
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
questions you ought to be communicating
 
05:42:30.288 --> 05:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
with folks either with Dave or Mel here
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
or with myself and Glenn or others on
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
the committee to try and get that little
 
05:42:38.090 --> 05:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
note done because if we're going to have
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
amendments we're going to need those
 
05:42:40.970 --> 05:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm concerned about all these
 
05:42:42.770 --> 05:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
timelines when you say 10 days after
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing something you're going to be able
 
05:42:45.490 --> 05:42:45.500 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
that ain't going to work it in a school
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to be possible
 
05:42:54.288 --> 05:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
um it's and I I've asked uh
 
05:42:56.930 --> 05:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative cat's cabinet Tanner to
 
05:42:58.550 --> 05:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
look at what we just talked about what
 
05:43:00.530 --> 05:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
Glenn was just talking about I get a
 
05:43:03.288 --> 05:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
sense of what what where that fits with
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
the dyslexic Bill too so yeah yeah
 
05:43:10.250 --> 05:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm very cautious of building a
 
05:43:12.890 --> 05:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
program around one system
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
that is you know
 
05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
05:43:20.930 --> 05:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're looking at textbooks
 
05:43:22.610 --> 05:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
in Florida and California telling what
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do
 
05:43:41.410 --> 05:43:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
work session simply no actions taken in
 
05:43:47.570 --> 05:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
a work session work sessions primarily
 
05:43:49.128 --> 05:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
for those who need more information or
 
05:43:50.570 --> 05:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
we need to work more and build and we
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
have more bills there
 
05:43:56.208 --> 05:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
free finance and and the direct Medicaid
 
05:43:59.810 --> 05:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:06.470 --> 05:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've gone on to that very quickly and
 
05:44:06.480 --> 05:44:08.628 align:start position:0%
we've gone on to that very quickly and
I've

05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
I've
 
05:44:20.330 --> 05:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:22.990 --> 05:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's like going to a college classroom
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.840 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
there
