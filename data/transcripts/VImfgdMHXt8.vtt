amendment the amendment moves the word
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
reckless out of the original
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill you like to speak to your
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
second uh thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
would just say that we heard during
 
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from um several
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
people that do this as as their career
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that
 
00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 align:start position:0%
anybody that anybody is doing anything
 
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's crossing the line I don't believe
 
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
that anybody is intentionally putting
 
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
anybody's um you know mental health at
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
stake here and I believe that it that
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
it's time that we uh listen to the
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
constituents thank you I would add as
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
far as the amendment goes we we heard
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
from um we heard from the mental health
 
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
community and I recognize their concerns
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
and the so did the sponsor and after
 
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
own yeah you might want to move to the
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
front then because I'm not going to I'm
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
not going to yell um your mic pull to
 
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
um in any event we spoke to the mental
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
health community and as a result we
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
amended this to take the word recklessly
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
out of it so that someone couldn't
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily be charged for an action
 
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
that they might not be responsible for
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
due to a mental health
 
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%

bill oh yeah I need a
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
second sure second seconded on the
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you um this amendment to
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
the bill was done after speaking with
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
the National Rifle Association and
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
several other Pro Second Amendment
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
groups who agreed with the concept that
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
um after all the NRA did invent Nicks um
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we report mental health prohibitors
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
to Nicks um however what they were
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
concerned with is a confiscation piece
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
so the entire confiscation piece has
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
been left out and taken out now the
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
judge will just advise someone who has
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
been so restricted that they have to
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
dispose of their firearms if they have
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
any um so otherwise the bill is the
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
same and I'm open for further discussion
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
on the bill on the
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
that is this the same amendment that you
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
introduced when you introduced the bill
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe so I believe this is a
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
a further Amendment this was this is one
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
that I got after that date is
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
0328 this is 0487

representative chairman Roy I've
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
received more emails asking for this
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
bill to be opposed than any other bill
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
on our docket today um I don't know if
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
the public is completely on our side on
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
this one sir thank you I I would suggest
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
that those emails um are the result of
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
very strong campaign by several local
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
gun uh groups to get people to oppose it
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
however if you read the emails and I
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
have done so they they claim a false
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
thing they claim that this is a red flag
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill which is and they claim that it it
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
denies due process the bill is neither
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
um a red red flag bill is when someone
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
makes an allegation against somebody
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
that they may be dangerous and based on
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
that allegation the police go and take
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
their their
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
firearms this bill someone has to
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
actually be brought to the court first
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
proved that they are dangerous to
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
themselves or others in a court of law
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
when they have an attorney and only
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
after then can they be banned from
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
wanning Firearms so that the difference
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
between a red flag Bill and this are
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
night and day um this bill is the same
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
as is the law in 48 other states whereas
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think only 14 States or 20 States may
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
have a red flag law so there's there's a
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
big difference between the two so that's
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's my answer to the emails any
 
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.350 align:start position:0%
that's my answer to the emails any
further

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
motion and the motion is to adopt
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%

amendment fine-tune
the

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
bail position based on what we received
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
for input from the governor's office the
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
chief executive who's in charge of
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws in our
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
state has asked us to tighten these we
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
have heard from the people of Manchester
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
that they request that our bail bills be
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
tightened that too many people were
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
getting out whether or not that is the
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
case is the public perception that it is
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
um I've seen arguments both ways uh
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions were raised about the recent
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
um knife attack in Manchester if you
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
look into it it's really difficult to
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
tell who should have U been arrested who
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
should have been charged and who should
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
have been let go in that case with two
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
people fighting wedding the police at
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
the time did not argue against his
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
release the judge who looked at the case
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
the next Monday did not feel that he
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be held and then on
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
appeal um to a superior court judge he
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that the person should be
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
held so that was a bad case to to argue
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
for this but there are other cases that
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
are not quite so debatable there people
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
have been let go so this is what we're
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with today is the
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that's going to be considered
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to support it would
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
second no thank you Mr chairman great
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
job further
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
Muse I would like to point out that the
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
that the one uh incident that's been
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
used as really the primary driver uh for
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
this bill has not even gone to trial yet
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
um we are basically making a decision on
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
changing New Hampshire law based on
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
incremental reporting um of varying
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
quality by different news organizations
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
um which is not the way we should be
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
doing things in the New Hampshire house
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment itself it
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
makes some substantial changes to bail
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
policy that only took effect on the 1st
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
of January um the bottom line is it's
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
extremely rare uh even in circumstances
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
like the ones that we're in now where in
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
February uh we're making changes of a
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
laot to a law that just took effect in
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
at the on the 1 of January so um
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unlike last year we just
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to slow down this
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
process and really take a careful
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
well-considered look and as a result we
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
have some things that are baked into
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment that I I think are
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
substantial changes that a lot of folks
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
are not going to agree with so for
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
instance in this in this amendment under
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
under this amendment uh people will be
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
able to be held for 36 hours instead of
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
24 hours uh without a hearing uh they'll
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
be able to be held over the weekend and
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
it won't count against those 32 hours so
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
instead of including time spent over the
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
weekend it actually this amendment
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
actually excludes that time the other
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
thing that this amendment does is it
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
changes the standard of evidence from
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence uh to
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause so prob cause is the same
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence uh that police
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
officers use to arrest people so
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
actually having uh in statute the
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
ability to hold People based on no
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
information that it took to arrest them
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
um why do we even have judges for why do
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
we have people who were involved in this
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
process the bottom line is there are
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
always changes and tweaks that we can
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
make to our laws uh but those changes
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
and tweaks should be well considered and
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be uh the product of a
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
pitchfork and torches process which this
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
has been thank
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none oh representative
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um yeah I just
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
want to uplift everything my colleague
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
just said I think um he hit it right on
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
the nose it is disappointing to have
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
spent so much time really carefully
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
making um adjustments to our bail
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
process that haven't been given the time
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
of day um to you know fully work or or
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
not work yet and I would have been happy
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
to make further adjustments carefully
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
and with time and it's unfortunate that
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
um this is being rushed through for um
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
other reasons um and I just wanted to St
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
as a resident and representative
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester I have had constituents ask
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
me to vote against this not everyone in
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester feels like this is a problem
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact a lot of people do think
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
that um changing the bail law like this
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
is going to um risk violating people's
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and there are
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about that so I will be voting
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
against this amendment um I think we did
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of really good and intentional
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
work over the past two years as a
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee and like I said I would be
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
happy to continue it further I just
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe rushing through this bill
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
right now when we haven't even given um
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
time for the changes we made to already
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
play out doesn't make
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
sense thank you um for the for the
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
record I just want to note the the
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
36-hour piece this applies only to
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
people that commit those crimes that are
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
on the list that we sent in last year
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
that could not be heard by uh bail
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners otherwise the vast
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
majority of cases will be hurled by bail
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and people will be
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
released promptly or decisions made to
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
hold them promptly this 36-hour piece
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
only applies to those charged with the
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
most serious
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
