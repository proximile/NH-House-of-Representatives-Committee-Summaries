all thank you everyone uh we won't be
 
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
taking any testimony uh today we'll just
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
be uh uh talking within ourselves which
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're more than welcome to listen to
 
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
and then we'll eventually at the end of
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
the uh discussion we'll be doing a
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to the uh Full House
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
we can get some from you because you're
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
a a member of the local planning board
 
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
I I have a few
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
concerns um about recovery houses
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
first being that the house can go into
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
operation before it's certified that's
 
00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.029 align:start position:0%
operation before it's certified that's
number

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
one number two is
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
parking and my assumption is that
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
because people who are resident in
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
recovery houses are holding down jobs
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
they need a means of getting two and
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
from their jobs and other activities
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
community and my final
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
concern is with septic systems where the
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
recovery house is not on a Town sewer
 
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
system and I guess in order of
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
importance it's number three the the
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
septic system and how towns are are
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to handle that I did a
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
research and there is
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
statute and I'd be happy
 
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
out there is statute that
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
addresses uh septic
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
systems when a change of use occurs
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
which gets us back to the original
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
language of the bill which says that the
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
sober house or the recovery house has to
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
be treated like any other house as far
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
as zoning
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
goes the the point is that I
 
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a state law well it is a
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
state law and it's more of a health
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
than a zoning issue so I would I would
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
hope that the state law would kick in at
 
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 align:start position:0%
some point and my my hope would
 
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.150 align:start position:0%
some point and my my hope would
[Music]

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
be that um when a house applies for
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
certification or actually applies to a
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
town they would have to certify the
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
design capacity of the septic system
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
and if the intended
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy exceeds the design capacity
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
which is usually two people per bedroom
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
and there are State
 
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
definitions of bedrooms room with a
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
closet um then the state RSA would kick
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
in which would require
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
design of a suit ably sized septic
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
system uh I believe before a certificate
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
of occupancy could be obtained and
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's actually similar language or
 
00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
there's actually similar language or
similar

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirement in last year's HB
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
1291 which was a bill having to do with
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
adus and if someone was going to build
 
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.909 align:start position:0%
adus and if someone was going to build
an

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
Adu then um you would have have to have
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
a septic system designed not install but
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
a design for the additional language
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
and I have that statute as
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
well not statute it's
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
Bill and I believe the language for that
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's that's something
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
that I think I would like to see in
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
because it's you know it's a it's a
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety matter and basically
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
just to speak to the parking matter
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
which I have shared as a concern um
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
throughout this but I think that's also
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
something that's already being enforced
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
through ordinances and regulations that
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have in our towns where you can't
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
park in the road during this time of the
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
year and and rules that we have like
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
that around parking where it's already
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
an issue that they're going to have to
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
um figure out a way to work with um and
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
it's I don't feel that it's something
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
the government should be and the
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
municipality should be dictating when if
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
there was a large family that had kids
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
around the same age that would all have
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
way I I would agree with you
 
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.310 align:start position:0%
way I I would agree with you
representative

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
representative
gero

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
towns you know your you're analogy to um
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
families with teenage
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
drivers um yeah you've got to deal with
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
it but I'm I'm wondering if it might be
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
in everybody's best interest to have
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
something about parking in the
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
legislation or perhaps in the
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
certification uh by the certifying
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
organization which just kind of says to
 
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
organization which just kind of says to
the

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
operator don't you know you've got a
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh similarly in Rochester we have
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
these old big Victorian houses that can
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
get got converted to two
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
bedroom two and three unit Apartments
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the parking is designed for two cars so
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
we already got a problem in Rochester
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
with no uh excess parking for
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
multi-units in the old Victorian house
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
this would put it on a whole new level
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
cuz you're talking maybe maybe might be
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
six or seven cars in one building where
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
they going to park I mean you do have uh
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
small streets in the little
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and they're supposed to
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
have all have to have off street parking
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
in the winter that's part of our
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
ordinances so they're parking up on
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
their lawn and whatnot but you're
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
talking six seven eight cars that's a
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
whole new level they don't have room to
 
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
park yeah no I definitely understand
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
that and I think that any owner of these
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
facilities is going to understand that
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
too and see that as a problem I would
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
just hate to see that get in the way of
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
us being able to help solve the issue of
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
both homelessness and then sobriety in
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the state over a matter such as parking
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
when it's an issue that's going to have
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
anyways represent
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
Doan thank you um I had several
 
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that I wanted to bring up um
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it was based on the
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received in our first
 
00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:07.870 align:start position:0%
testimony that we received in our first
subcommittee

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
session um I in general I I view I think
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
these are the recovery house more
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
Recovery House beds are needed we we we
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
need to help provide those services for
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
those those people who I'll I would like
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
to include them as in the
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
U purative they're the some of the most
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
needy Among Us uh and really need our
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
help but there's a big
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
butt when when we're caring for the
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
needy or for those most vulnerable I
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
think we need to be especially careful
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we provide them with with uh the
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
kind of safety and and help that that
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
they're really going to need I
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
the one of the biggest problems I have
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill is there's too many carve
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
outs in it that that when we're looking
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
to help these needy
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
folks we
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
exempt many of the
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
safety uh guard rails that we put up uh
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
in our communities and these are these
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
are the people that need those safety
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
guard rails when they go to bed at
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
night and they're perhaps a little
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
compromise when they go to bed whether
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
they're falling off the wagon or or
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
getting involved in
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
Narcotics a subsequent time the the
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
thing they don't need is when they wake
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
up at 2 in the morning and there's no
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
and there's and they need to exit the
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
building for whatever reason some type
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
of an emergency a fire for example if
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's no lighted exit signs to help
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
them navigate their way out of the
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
building uh which which this this type
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
of legislation would exempt that and say
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
oh it's not important to provide those
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
those safety uh guard rails for these
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
people um smoke alarms
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
um sprinkler systems these are all
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
things that that when you have people
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people like this those are
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
the guard rails that we as legislators
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
can help and put help put in place yes
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's going to make make
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
the the expense of maintaining that
 
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.150 align:start position:0%
the the expense of maintaining that
property

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
higher but what's what is the price of a
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
life or several lives that may be lost
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
because of that do we do we do we want
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
to be the ones that call uh Mrs Smith up
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
and say we lost your son in a fire and
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't take the time to put any smoke
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
uh Det curent uh in the building even
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
though we knew they were compromised or
 
00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.670 align:start position:0%
though we knew they were compromised or
needy

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
needy
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
folks uh we had some testimony
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
about uh Americans with Disability Act
 
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
about uh Americans with Disability Act
uh

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
application uh and the F in our first
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
meeting we we take very special care to
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
provide that type of help for fully uh
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
for people that are not involved in in a
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
recovery house that just want to have
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
ACC public access to a public building
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh to so that they can go to the town
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
hall or they can go to the city hall or
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and we we bend over backwards
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure those doors are open that
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
there's enough toilets and that there
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
are lighted exit signs for their safety
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
but when we go into a a community house
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
that's a recovery house we give carv Val
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
to say you don't have to do that anymore
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
I I just think that would be
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
irresponsible on our part to to
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh to allow people to u to navigate
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
through these properties without those
 
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.309 align:start position:0%
through these properties without those
protections

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
U I think it's I think we're sacrificing
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
safety at the wrong time and the wrong
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
point in their lives and this is going
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of folks we T we heard
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh that this right now
 
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.429 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh that this right now
that

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
this this category of people represents
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
about 1300 beds in the state right now
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
and that this
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
change uh would help
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
us uh achieve the need that we have of
 
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.789 align:start position:0%
us uh achieve the need that we have of
about

00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
15,000 uh beds in this house do we
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
really want to go back to our local
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
communities and say hey we've we've
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
taken the the uh 1300 bed requirement
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
and up to to 15,000 oh by the way uh the
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll there's no requirement
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
for any site plan review or any
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
permitting uh that your community has in
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
place to be able to apply to these
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
things to these houses uh I I just think
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
that would be totally unacceptable to
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the to the uh Community leaders that we
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
have to bring this story back to
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
eventually um so that that's what my
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
heads right now on this Mr chairman
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you represent repres Jama thank
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
you um I absolutely share safety of
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
especially the individuals who are
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in going into these houses as
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
one of my main concerns but I think that
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at where they would be
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
if they weren't in these houses and
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
where they would end up whether it be um
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
having trouble maintaining sobriety not
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
in the group setting um or whether it be
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
going to prison or even losing a life as
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
we said without an exit sign um I think
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
we'd be I think we would see a lot more
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
deaths and a lot less productivity and
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
second chances for the most vulnerable
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
people in our society um if we made
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
that drag this bill down um but I'd like
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
to know what the rest of the committee
 
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.789 align:start position:0%
to know what the rest of the committee
would

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
think represent
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
Frank thank you um
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
I'm recalling testimony from several
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
people that indicated that the residents
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
of a Recovery House are quite High
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
highly functioning
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
people um they're folks that can because
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
they've gone
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
through a a process already
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
they are back
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
to a normal life shall I say I don't
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
know if that's the correct
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
terminology but they just need a lot of
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
support to stay
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
sober and my takeaway from the testimony
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
was that they could live in a house by
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
themselves or an apartment by
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
themselves but because of this peer
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
support um
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
they may choose to live in a conjugate
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
setting with others who are in a similar
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
situation and I guess I draw the analogy
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
to do you have exit signs and emergency
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
exits in your house or your
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
apartment and I know of a very few
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
people who do
 
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.149 align:start position:0%
people who do
that

00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
um that's my two cents on that I'm not
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to to downplay the safety
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
aspect but I I want to emphasize that
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I heard was that the
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
residents in a Recovery House
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
are pretty high
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
functioning very high functioning rep
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you Mr chair um and uh
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative I I I don't argue with
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
that point I do
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
I I will bring to the table today that
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh I had a uh a resident Bring me um an
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
example I don't have personal knowledge
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
of it so I kind of it's kind of hearsay
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
at this point but
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh a a recovery house that that he's
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
aware of um had a had a
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
problem that was
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
revealed to him through a freedom of
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
Information Act
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
request that uh in their recovery house
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh person
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
died uh due to an
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
overdose of drugs uh and so that that's
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
an indication that some of these folks
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
aren't all on the straight narrow that
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
they that they
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
are uh in
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
recovery hence the name recovery houses
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
but also with the potential of Rel abs
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps D in in
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
danger uh and so uh this this
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
information was as relate to me was was
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
um was received again through a fouryear
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
request U and I think it was in the
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the conquered uh uh
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
walker uh my major uh issue with this
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill outside of what everybody else has
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
said because I share those as well is
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
that it exempts from all site plan
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
review and
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
codes and these were single they want to
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
be treated as single family
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
homes but before there a recovery house
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
they weren't single family homes they
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
were Apartments three and four unit
 
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.430 align:start position:0%
were Apartments three and four unit
apartment

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
so the issues are different and it's
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
a issue in the neighborhoods something
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
like this might not fit the neighborhood
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
that they're being shoehorned in so and
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
I definitely don't like them being
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
exempt from any safety safety codes and
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
view uh rep
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you um so when I look at the
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill when I look at like the single
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
family two family and multif family I
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
think what the intention would be is not
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
that it turns in from a single family to
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
an apartment while the heads obviously
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
does go up a little bit um they're still
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances yeah but when you take and
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
you they find a three or four unit
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
building they still want to be treated
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
like a single family and they and it's
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's there codes a difference um the
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
sorry the language here would shall be
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
treated in every zoning ordinance as a
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
single family two two family or multif
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
family use
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
respectively so I think that I'm not
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
sure how you feel about that I think
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
that meets some of those concerns where
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
if it is already an apartment building
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
Frack go ahead representative you so I
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
did actually um
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
receive some language it's just a rough
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
draft obviously but just it would be
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
expanding the notice that these homes
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
would give to
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities um with written notice
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
written notification the local governing
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
body at least 30 days prior to the
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of operations and through the
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
certifying body shall notify the
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
municipality whenever the recovery
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
recovery residence applies for
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
certification becomes certified renew
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
certification is denied certification or
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
loses certification so that's what this
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
language would
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
add thank you
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
wer that that's another
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
point is they want to get into this
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
these places before
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
certification I think they should get
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
into these buildings after
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
certification I do gen I I do agree and
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's a question that in the hearings I
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
also lost a asked a lot of people um I
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
have the certification requirements in
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
front of me I know it was handed out
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
last time um but you can't become
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
certified until you have the residents
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the home and they model the behavior
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities that the
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
certification requires of these houses
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the holdups there and I do
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
agree I would rather a certification
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
process where they could have a
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
certification day one but that's just
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
not how the certifications work with how
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
kind of in depth they want where the
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
too repres D yeah I I
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
think it kind of I kind I think we're
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
getting towards the end here but I think
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
that the way I look at this is
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
that some of these folks who provide
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
this service are doing a a wonderful
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
work in an area that's very much needed
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
for the PE for the people that it
 
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
for the PE for the people that it
applies

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
to I think that when we're trying to
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
craft legislation it should be to try to
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
help the process and try to help those
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
that have this need uh that we I think
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
we recognize is out
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
there however I think this legislation
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
help the process in fact I think it
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
hinders the process and puts people who
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
are at risk even more at risk by uh not
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
requiring approvals and certifications
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
and and inspections and all that stuff I
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
I I think by I think while we're trying
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
to do good stuff we're not achieving
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
that by by relieving the requirements to
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
be safe and be certified so so that's
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
right represent
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
Frank so the the question or the the
 
00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:19.190 align:start position:0%
Frank so the the question or the the
conundrum

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
conundrum
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
is we have a certifying organization or
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps more than one which says that
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
that their
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
certification begins once the home is
 
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.789 align:start position:0%
certification begins once the home is
actually

00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.509 align:start position:0%
actually
occupied

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
occupied
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
and do we as legislators have the
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
ability to in essence re revamp their
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
certification process and I don't have
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question but it seems
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
to me that that's a question that needs
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
I think if you check your emails there's
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
a letter from Health and Human
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
Services uh let me address a little bit
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
call

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:56.909 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:31:26.909 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary the one thing I would say in
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
regards to registry for this bill is
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
that this does require notification to
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities so it would require them
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
to give
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
notice say can say it again as far as
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
registry with these homes under this
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill it does require notice to the
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
municipality so they would have to let
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
their intentions be known 30 days before
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
opening with the language that I handed
 
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.190 align:start position:0%
opening with the language that I handed
out

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the 30-day notice do you see that
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
that as a conflict with the words of the
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that says it's it's not
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
subject to permitting or
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
approval I is you you see that not
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily a conflict but do you see
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
that as a as a conflict yeah I do I do
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
see what you're saying there
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
but it does it is contingent that you
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
can only have that treatment if you give
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
notice to the municipality 30 days
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
prior so so um we'd have to
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
amend amend the this to take take that
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
out or add this in or whatever yeah we
 
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
it did uh everyone have a chance to
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
review the email from uh Jenny O Higgins
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
that I sent
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
out concerning their position on uh well
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
the it talks about recovery residence
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
and the requirements of registry and a
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
few other
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
things and that was I don't have that
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
available on my phone oh
 
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.430 align:start position:0%
available on my phone oh

elater I'll let you type in okay
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
John I don't know which button to hit to
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh any more comments from
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee I've got a couple couple of
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
things that I want to mention one of the
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
things that stand out stood out to me on
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
the on the bill as we got it uh it's
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
crossed out safe and healthy and I can't
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
figure out why anyone would cross out
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy and I believe I
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
answered the sponsor and she didn't
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
really have any of any answer to why
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
that was crossed out uh that's one
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
problem I have with
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
it because I think it should provide a
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy substance for your
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
living environment I don't have any
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
problem with not having the family like
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
but safe and healthy is a real concern
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
for me uh another concern is
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the certification I too agree
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
that they should be certified prior to
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
opening uh and also I think that we
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
taking uh away the power of the local
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
communities uh this is something that
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
should be done locally they should be
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
able to decide and pass
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
regulations uh that they feel
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary uh it appears the city of
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
Nashua has done something with this and
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
they they seem to have dealt with the
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
issue uh without an RSA and I think
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's great again I'm I'm very
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to uh folks that need this
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh this Avenue to pursue a a healthy
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
life but I also think we've got to be
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about their safety and uh uh
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
the feelings of our uh our
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
constituents and I think it's it's best
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
left on the on the local level to maybe
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
they can contact the city of nashille
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
and get a copy of their ordinance to see
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
how they're dealing with it and start
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
use that as a starting point uh but I
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
don't think the state should pass a a
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
law that tells them how to run their
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
communities uh and again the main thing
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
is safe and healthy that's one of the
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
primary concerns that I have and by
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
removing that I I don't know why anyone
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
would remove that from the bill that's
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
in the current law and I I can't figure
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
that go ahead representative thank you
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
would you be it all open to an amendment
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
that would add in safe and healthy back
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
into it I know the certification process
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
is definitely could be a concern since
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
they don't have it day one but I think
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a separate Avenue that we
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
have to go down um that would even
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
address the ones that are open now with
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
place I I would just have to say see the
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
see the amendment as as you as you've
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
written it I don't want to commit to it
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
because I haven't seen it yet uh but
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy uh would address one of
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill and the certification uh I guess
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would have to be done by
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislation or you know requiring the
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
certification maybe we could work with
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to get their
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
ideas on how to do
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
that maybe they can do by regulation I'm
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
not sure I think right now the statue
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
voluntary and not required right and I
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
think that would be something that yeah
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
whether this be passed or not we could
 
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.790 align:start position:0%
whether this be passed or not we could
look

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
into of a change in the certification
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
make yeah yeah it already is a process
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
yeah just with whatever ordinances
 
00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:31.790 align:start position:0%
yeah just with whatever ordinances
they're

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
in I think that's a great idea thank
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Dolan you have
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything yeah I think I I would again
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
let me say
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
that this is needed recovery houses are
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
needed in the state but I would be much
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
more comfortable if we if we added them
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
into being ada8 compliant so that
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're safe and we know exactly
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
no matter where you look in the state we
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
know exactly what's going to be in those
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
houses that have the right number of
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
toilets and they have the right number
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
of of fire extinguishes and all that
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
stuff uh I don't think there's any
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
reason why we would want to exempt ADA
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
compliance other than to make it more
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
profitable for for the owners and that I
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as is my goal in in
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
examining this legislation for for owner
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
profitability it it's primarily for the
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
safety of the occupants uh that are
 
00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:35.670 align:start position:0%
safety of the occupants uh that are
under

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
treatment thank you rep
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
Frack aren't a lot of these recovery
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofits I don't believe
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
so okay I don't yeah I don't have
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
reasons for why but I believe that that
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another it's
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
easier to not be a nonprofit I'm not
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure if
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
someone yeah okay okay I I thought we
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
had heard that it was a mix I think it
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
probably is a mix but from what I heard
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
in talking with people it primarily
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay so minus understand the primary
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
thing that we all agree on certification
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
as part of being
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
certified is that a fair assumption they
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
certified you on vot of that
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
one prior to
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
applying for this yeah prior to approval
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
approval I could be
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh the other concern is we have
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
some uh uh concerns about health and
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
safety of the
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
building and the residents and you know
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to talk about prior to
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
approval that kind of throws a wrench
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
into the legislation because this is
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
supposedly doesn't require an approval
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
process according to the legislation so
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that that has to be eradicated from
 
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.109 align:start position:0%
that that that has to be eradicated from
the

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
legislation R Frack are we talking
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
approval by the certifying organization
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
or approval by the
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
municipality because I I see two
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
here I think RSA
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
B2 is
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's the uh the state
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
certification I I think that we're
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
talking you're you're right there's a
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
mix of approvals I but I think the one
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that I would be uh focused on is
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the land use boards in the
 
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.589 align:start position:0%
the the land use boards in the
individual

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
Community to your point uh
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
representative I think that if we if
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to deny the community the
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
right to adjudicate things like this in
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
their own Community I think that's
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
that's a risky road to go down I think
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
the the um the zoning board and the
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
planning boards need to be involved in
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
in these
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
decisions uh and so it's not just a
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
state certification in my mind it's it's
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the land use boards that would apply and
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
depending on how the
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
community uh town government has set
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
up I I would agree with you
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
100% um I feel very confident
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
in the ability of Municipal and count
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
government to address land used issues
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
but I don't feel that we have the
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
expertise to address the
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
certification of a social
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
service organization I I guess you would
 
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.750 align:start position:0%
service organization I I guess you would
call

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
it I agree uh it's it's just totally out
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse repr Jam thank you um I think
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
with a lot of what we're bringing up
 
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:04.810 align:start position:0%
while there's clearly a difference
 
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.069 align:start position:0%
while there's clearly a difference
[Music]

00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
between these houses and if it were to
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
be eight people living in a home that
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
had never dealt with addiction I think a
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
lot of these questions wouldn't be being
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
asked if that wasn't a
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
factor so I think a lot of this is stuff
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
that could be looked into regardless of
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and that shouldn't be dragging
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
way we Frank on your on your current
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
lives these should be consider these are
 
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.109 align:start position:0%
lives these should be consider these are
considered

00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities alcohol and and
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
Drug my my understanding is that under
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
federal law um substance abuse is
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
a protected class
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
of disability or medical condition so it
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
it can't be discriminated against by a
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
town or a state that
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
says you can't you know we we're going
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
to treat you differently than anybody
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
else who does not suffer from substance
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
abuse that's my understanding and I I
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
could be I could be wrong
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's the way I understand also now on
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
in your community you
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
have regulations zoning regulations and
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
planning regulations that address
 
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.589 align:start position:0%
planning regulations that address
disability

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
issues um other than ADA requirements we
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
do not we do have at least one
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
house which is for developmentally
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
disabled people
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't actually know if it existed
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
pre- zoning or if they got any kind of
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
special exception it's certainly
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
something that I would be willing to
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
investigate and report back to the
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um they that house happens
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
to be about probably 3/4 of a mile from
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
where I
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
live and from what I know it causes no
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
problems and the the same
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
organization just opened another house
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
in downtown
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hanover and as far as I know it is also
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
causing no problems but again I I'd be
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
very happy to investigate and report
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
back uh thank you representative Dolan
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I guess I may
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
start sound like a broken record here
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
but I this certification process that
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're hinting at and you know some
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
some uh we're we I feel like we're in
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
the we're kind of in the process of
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
inventing this certification process um
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then asking the
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
communities to apply it uh in in their
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
communities I I think it's would be much
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
cleaner and less um of a risk for the
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
communities to just in the legislation
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
just say that these recovery houses have
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
to be ADA Compliant period and then it
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
becomes you it's it's just an overlay
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the federal requirements you just
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
if you just live with the federal
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
requirements then you're compliant and
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
you from from a legislation and and a
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
regulation standpoint but from a caring
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the individual which is a a little
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a softer science I think we can
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
sleep better at night that we have done
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
the right thing for these for these
 
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.670 align:start position:0%
the right thing for these for these
compromise

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
individuals uh if they if if we know
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be residing in an
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant facility although that may
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
be a little more expensive for the for
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
the house owner it's it's safer and uh I
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
think it's better for the for the this
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise I represent
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
Jama thanks
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
blanked represent Frank thank you Mr
 
00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.150 align:start position:0%
blanked represent Frank thank you Mr
chair

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
um getting back to the question of ADA
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
compliance and and I I'm drawing from
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard on some of the
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
other bills VA um modifications
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
Etc uh I think but I don't know for
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
certain that ADA requirements only apply
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
to publicly accessible
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
buildings and ADA
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
requirements specifically address phys
 
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.270 align:start position:0%
requirements specifically address phys
physical

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
physical
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I'm not sure that all
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
people in the subset of substance
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
abusers who are in recovery suffer
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
from physical disabilities that would
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
require any kind of
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
modification I'm just raising a question
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thank you
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
I got it back um yeah just to piggyback
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
a about off that a little bit too um
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
these are also issues that could be
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
looked into regardless of whether this
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill was passed or not looking into the
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
certifying process and um kind of
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
everything that has to do with that um
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
process I think if that was a concern
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
that would have to be done with or
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%

committee based on the statue that we're
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%

itl you want to talk to your motion

represent Walker I think there's just a
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
number of issues and we have no
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendments and we're running out of time
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
to get it to our
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
last exe exec I
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and I think we just itl it at
 
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.510 align:start position:0%
meeting and I think we just itl it at
this

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you uh represent
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you yeah I do oppose an itl
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
motion um I think that this is
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that's really needed um and
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
while there are some issues that I do
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
feel will be fixed through an amendment
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the issues that we've
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
brought up today I feel like our
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
problems regarding less this Bill gets
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
signed or not and our problems whether
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
it be a sober living home or whether it
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
be eight people who have never had
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
addiction problem that would be going
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
into living a home together um so I just
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of these issues aren't
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh any other comments
 
00:53:49.319 --> 00:53:50.230 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh any other comments
resent

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
resent
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
Frank uh I definitely agree with the
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
sentiments of Representative ger
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
there are lots of issues
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
and my thought is that the the same
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
issues apply
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
to sober
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
houses as apply
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
to college
 
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.789 align:start position:0%
to college
student

00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
um Loop homes for developmentally
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
disabled people as apply to
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.829 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
even

00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
and last week I spoke with
 
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.710 align:start position:0%
and last week I spoke with
representative

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
Howland who you may remember from our
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
committee who is now on the housing
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
committee and his suggestion was to try
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
to get the two committees together under
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what sort of an
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
umbrella and see if we could hash these
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
things out over time so that the state
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
has a more or less uniform
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
policy on residences that are occupied
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
by I'm going to say not
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
families and uh it it seems to me that
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
okay so I so I would go along with with
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
itl okay because I think it's a it's a
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
problem that requires a lot more study
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
