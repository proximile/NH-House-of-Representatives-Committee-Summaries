00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
of Information
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
Technology um I'm at home um my wife is
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
in the house uh but not in the room with
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
me um uh as representative Ober said the
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
the main purpose of this this bill was
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
to really um to bring into statute um a
 
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
couple of items that had been um we'
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
been operating under executive order
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
from back in Governor hasson's day um
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
there the cyber security advisory
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
committee and and the New Hampshire
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
cyber integration
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
Center the advisory committee is our way
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
to communicate with um folks around uh
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
all of the branches of government we
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
have membership from all the branches as
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
well as the um as a a representative
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
from each executive branch
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
agency that entity um uh helps us
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
develop cyber security policy but we
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
also communicate and and um and uh find
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
out the impacts of policy before we
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
implement it by through discussion with
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
that group we then take any new policies
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we might be creating through the
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
CAC and bring them to the it Council um
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
where uh we could ratify um it council
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
is defined in RSA 21r as the governing
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
body for uh the executive branch it
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
agency Department of Information
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
Technology so it's really a very
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
effective committee that we think we
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
should just continue so rather having it
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
exist under um under executive order
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have it in statute uh
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
similarly uh the cyber security um the
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
NH kick or the um cyber security
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
integration Center is the hub for um
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
watching and reacting to cyber incidents
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um it's
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
been very effective U over its time and
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
again it it existed and was formed under
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
executive order and and uh we'd like to
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
have it in statute most recently the um
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
the uh NH kick or the Cyber integration
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
Center was very involved in um you know
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
watching and managing the the very large
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
number of attacks or attempted attacks
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
against state government uh by uh
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
foreign entities both during the
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
elections as well as um as well as
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
associated with um our covid-19
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
activities trying to take advantage of
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
people um in this in this time of
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
emergency that concludes my testimony
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm available for
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%

right now these two positions are the
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
positions in the current state budget um
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
and at this same pay
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
level uh yes um the positions exist and

are filled and um have fairly recently
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
care is there anyone else wishing to
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
speak I I I've raised my hand Mr
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I I have a question uh uh go
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you thank you very much uh
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
let me turn my camera on so you can see
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
me uh is the Comm still on the line he
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay so Mr commissioner as you know
 
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
from having been before us numerous
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
times uh in the past this committee has
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
been very supportive not only of the
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
efforts of your department but your uh
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
of your oversight uh and I'm wondering
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
uh whether there's whether they're going
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
to hear any further Witnesses uh
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
especially anyone in opposition to this
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh which seems to me to be a very
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward Common Sense bill which
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
I will support but I'm just wondering
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
whether there's any any downside to it
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we have yet to hear
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
of um thank you for the question sir um
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any um in fact I think
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
that the folks that um have participated
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
in in the the CAC the cyber security
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
advisory committee have been very
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
pleased um historically if you looked
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
back prior to implementing that entity
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the way we have it there were
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
occasions where we would Implement cyber
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
policy that that hadn't really been as
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
vetted as well as we can vet it now and
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
the real D downside to that is you know
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
implementing something that's good cyber
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
policy but also stops legitimate
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
business or state you know citizen
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
service activities so what we really
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
strive to do is have good cyber security
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
policy as in in a way that isn't going
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
to negatively affect affect our citizen
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
service Mission so I I'm not aware of
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
any detractors up for this followup Mr
 
00:14:58.279 --> 00:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
any detractors up for this followup Mr
chair

00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you uh and
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh you know in the past
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
when you've been before us we've always
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
asked you what the status of uh the
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing attacks against uh the state uh
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
are and uh are we keeping a breast of
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
the effective uh defense that we've been
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
engaged in uh in view of the fact that
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
the technology is constantly evolving uh
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
are holding our
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
own thank you for the question um we
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
we've been doing a number of things
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
lately and one of them is um we we did
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
actually conduct um a a uh Statewide
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch cyber risk assessment
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
um that was funded with um Capital that
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that um was approved in the the
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
current budget um and we've uh done some
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
some mitigation steps there and we
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
continue to do mitigation steps
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
associate with the findings of that um
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive cyber risk assessment
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
we've also done some specific things
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
around um activities that have been
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
occurring in covid so early in covid
 
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
recovery and response we actually um
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
were benefited from guard activation
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
cyber Warriors they called them so we
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
actually had some really great expertise
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
come and help us um you know keep up
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
with things during that really that
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
large surge of activity that occurred
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
early on and we continue to see a very
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know an a heightened an increase
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
amount of activity uh as it relates to
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
um two primary things one is the know
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
attempts to get into the
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
network um and and in nowadays when they
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
get into the network it's mostly for
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
economic benefit you know to to uh
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
promote ransomware that would could then
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
be used to to get money and the other
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
the other area that we see a lot of
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
activity on is um the the the idea of um
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
diverting funds for example go getting
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
into somebody's payroll uh payroll
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
account in um changing their direct
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
deposit number that that's also has
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
happened in in um uh It's associated
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
with um identity theft usually or
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
fishing attacks where somebody actually
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
gets um you know gets your login and
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
password gets you to give them your
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
login and password and then you go in
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and divert the funds that's happen and
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen that happen around the state
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
um not in state government but in local
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
governments with payroll systems and we
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
you you've heard about it happening in
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
in unemployment systems all around the
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
country um so we really must remain
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
constantly Vigilant um one thing we're
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
doing right now is um we're focused on
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
those Key Systems that we need to to do
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh to keep the vaccination effort going
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
so we're actually having our the folks
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
who did the Cyber risk R assessment
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're having them look at the Key
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
Systems that we use to run our our
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination um mission in the state and
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we didn't miss anything
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
so it's really a proactive we're
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
spending some some of that um some of
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
that Capital cyber Capital to
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
proactively look at um those systems
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%

there there is actually another um bill
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
um that that will be um considered that
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
um does a couple things with the
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities but I'll start by saying
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we what we've done recently is
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
formed an informal public private
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
partnership with primex who who carries
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
most of the insurance all the insurance
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
for um schools and uh insurance for most
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the the political subdivisions and
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
that so that's um with the Department of
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
Information Technology primex uh the
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
National Guard and then HRA Municipal
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
Association and Emergency Management in
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
the state and what we're doing is we're
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
we're actually hosting a cyber Summit in
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
March where we're going to introduce a
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
bunch of Concepts to anybody that wants
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
attend we're going to do it virtually we
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
had intended to do it um in person back
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
in May which obviously we didn't do so
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
now we're hosting a virtual session in
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
March uh additional things we're doing
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
is we're we're looking for um on a state
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
level we're we're seeking some Homeland
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
Security grant funding so that we could
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
offer free cyber um um cyber awareness
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
training to all
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
employees and and uh of of entities in
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
our political subdivisions to include
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
schools and uh and the the operations of
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
their governments so um I I think
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
there's a decent chance we'll get that
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
money and we'll be able to implement
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
offer free cyber awareness training and
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
on a national level we're working to
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
support and legislation um on the
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
national level that would create a cyber
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
grant program for state governments and
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
we believe and and hope and will try to
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
influence that grant program so that um
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
There are rules about money flowing down
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
to political subdivisions and not all
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
staying at the state government level so
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing lots of things I have a a
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
vision that over
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
time uh we have a really strong cyber
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
disruption plan that was developed with
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security money grant money in
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a state my vision
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
would be to have a that plan um
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
Encompass and engulf not engulf that
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
sounds too controlling but Encompass the
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivision such that if we
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
had a cyber incident anywhere um we all
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
knew how to react to it and we all knew
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
how to work together to help that entity
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school or a or a town or
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
a police department or a fire department
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
recover as quickly as
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
possible thank you that sounds really
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
great I'm working hard on it it's a it's
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%

I'm here to introduce House Bill
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
591 the Genesis of this bill goes back
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
to last term when we I guess your
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee and my committee were trying
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
to uh come up with a license and license
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
fee for vape
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
shops the license was to be included
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
within the tobacco product statutes
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
which really are embedded within the
 
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
which really are embedded within the
alcohol

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
statutes my ways the Means Committee in
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
doing the re its review discovered along
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
with the enforcement division of of the
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
commission that the whole category of
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
stores that did not sell alcohol
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
products was not being was only being
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
charged $6 for a license I repeat only
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
being charged $6 for a
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
license and this is the mistake and this
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
mistake as we kind of tentacle back uh
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
snakes back to when the uh tobacco
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
products fell within the Liquor Division
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh bunch of years ago so we we had
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
identified then right now there are
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
currently 1902
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
stores uh in this
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
category uh an an example would be
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
dollar stores uh they sell tobacco
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
products but they don't sell beer or
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
wine and they are only paying $6 for a
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
license to sell
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and in those
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
192 are because we we we were successful
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
in getting uh the vape shops license
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh but uh there must be around 15 or
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
those or so uh someone out of business
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
because of the the virus uh but but they
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
they are only paying $6 for a license so
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
we we tried to fix this last year and it
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
it died in the Senate uh when they you
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
know all those hundreds of bills didn't
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
make it through the
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
Senate so you say why the $6 how did
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
that happen well grocery stores
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
convenience stores drug stores and
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
others who have licens to sell beer or
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
and wine or beer or wine pay less uh uh
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
pay a license fee if they also sell
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco products they pay only an
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
additional $6 for a tobacco license so
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
it turns out the only thing on the books
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
is this $6 for a tobacco license nowhere
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
else in the statutes do you find uh a
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
fee or uh a fee for a license that's uh
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
for a store uh that that just sells
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco okay and what we try to do with
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
the fees and Ways and Means is to make
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
them kind of uh match up with the amount
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
of effort on the part of the enforcement
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
division to do their work and obviously
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
$6 was not
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
enough so this bill fixes that if you go
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
to uh line 10 to 13 of uh of the bill
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
you will see that we came up with a a li
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
a fee that kind of matches up with the
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
combination license for
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol now the other thing this bill
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
does uh is asks for two two new
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
investigators positions which were our
 
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
investigators positions which were our
sworn

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
sworn
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
officers okay sworn officers to be paid
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh in part from the new
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
fees uh this is on page two lines 27 to
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
36 and page three lines one and
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
two so um
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
if you spend any time in these
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
statutes you'll find that they are very
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
confusing and need to be streamlined
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is just a comment that we
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
discovered in ways that means that
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
recodification this is an aside just a
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
recodification of these statutes was
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
probably not a bad thing to be done as a
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
maybe jointly between our
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
committees uh uh and the and the first
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
ones to agree with that is the Liquor
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
Commission that they're very
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
confusing but what we tried to do in
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is fix one thing was and
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's the uh
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
that when we were doing our work we
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't match up the license with the
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
fee okay and so the bill the bill also
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
does that's the third thing that the
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
bill does and you'll see a lot of you
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
see why is this bill so long it's
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
because that was our attempt to to fix
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
that so this past Ways and Means last
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
year I think we got a from from your
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
committee uh and again like I said uh it
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
passed the unanimous in our committee
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
our committee in ways and means and this
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
was the casualty of the Senate again uh
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
last year so Mr chair my understanding
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
is that and and I I think we got this
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
from uh chair Maguire that this bill is
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
going to be coming to Ways and Means and
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
that her interest was not in the the the
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
fees per se that she would let Ways and
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
Means deal with that if you you indeed
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
through um so is that your understanding
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh U Mr chair chairman Roy yes okay
 
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
so so but I emailed uh the committee and
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
um um U chairman Maguire and the
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee an
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
amendment in the last couple of months
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
I've been working with the the uh
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement division offline
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh because when we we looked at the
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
language we let me let me tell you the
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
three reasons for the amendment working
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
with them it does tighten up the the the
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
language even more to ensure that anyone
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
who has a current liquor license uh this
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
is on premises off- premises licenses
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh do not have to
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
pay the tobac the full tobacco license
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
they continue to pay the $6 so we made
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure that that language was tightened up
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that only
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
happens um understand over time you know
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh um you know convenience stores uh
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and drug stores have the
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
combination Li most of them do but now
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
some of the drugstores don't carry
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco products because of health
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
reasons so so it's important that we
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
have a separate tobacco license for well
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
those 192 two stores that we were
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
talking about first as well as U making
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
$6 uh doesn't get applied to you say
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
well why don't we just include the WRA
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
the tobacco license into the liquor
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
license no we can't do that
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
so so the second thing it does is the pl
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
U it changes the fee uh in the original
 
00:30:56.509 --> 00:30:56.519 align:start position:0%
Bell down a bit to being more in line
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
with the retail wine license um and that
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
was done after consultation with the
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission The Liquor Commission
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
folks and the third thing it does is it
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
changes the investig the uh investigator
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
position Swann officers and makes them
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
examiners as you know sworn officers are
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
are police officers they go to the
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
academy like the state police do and
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
they get uh and they they get an auto
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
mobile they got a a car uh very
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
expensive and in talking to the uh Mark
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
aagan he suggested that maybe we just he
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
just really needs two examiners
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
basically back room people doing the
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
examination so that's what this
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
amendment also does so those are the
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
three thing that the amendment
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
does um so I I would very much
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate that someone in the committee
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
move this amendment um Mr chair uh if
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
you feel more comfortable that we handle
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
this in ways the means I certainly would
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
do that in ways the means as well uh but
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
that's given your
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
call so Mr chair um I suggest you hear
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
from uh Chief amanian and Aiden
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
Moore uh next and they can give you more
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
specifics but I'm certainly willing to
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have thank
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Ry does anyone have
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Bary I
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
do okay I recognize representative
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
lakus okay thank you uh Mr chair um I'm
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
seeing two amendments uh 2021 D 0116 H
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
and uh 0180 h on this bill I mean is one
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
replacing the other are both being
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
proposed I can explain that uh the chair

licensing um first and foremost we are
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%

very grateful uh at The Liquor
Commission

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh that representative abrami uh brought
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
this bill forward it was brought forward
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
last year and got caught up and
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
everything and uh again this year now um
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
with that in mind um there there have
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
been over the years and I've been in
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
this position after leaving the state
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
police for 28 years uh for the last four
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
years uh it was very obvious to me when
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
I came into to this position that um
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of uh bills that were
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
brought forward over the years that
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
turned into law that created a lot of
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
interweaving between laws and and
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
created confusion uh like representative
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
abami brought up earlier uh when you
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
start identifying certain statutes in
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
title 13 um this is the first attempt to
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
clean things up um um and there will be
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
more attempts um in in the very near
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
future uh but uh as it as it pertains to
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
these positions um recognizing the
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal time that we're in right now um I
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
could tell you that uh and not to float
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
my own boat here for a lack of a better
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
term but um I I've over these last 34
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
years in law enforcement been very very
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
frugal um with the budgetary money that
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
has been graciously um earmarked for us
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh in both positions uh and um it was uh
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
through the benevolence of of the
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh ways and means when we were
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
in front of them that it was brought up
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
to us that there was a necessity for
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
these two
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
positions um to be brought forward uh a
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
as we have moved into these current
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
times um we all have to get a little bit
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
more creative um and one of the ways
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
that uh through the work of of myself
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
our legal coordinator Aiden Moore who is
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
one of my
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
predecessors uh and representative of
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
brownie um came up with this U
 
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
brownie um came up with this U
alternative

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
resolution uh and that would be uh to
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
use civilian uh examiners which are
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
actually for lack of a better term
 
00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:02.910 align:start position:0%
actually for lack of a better term
they're

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
Auditors uh to keep an eye on the books
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
um and and uh the taxes that need to be
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
paid by this uh license type um and and
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
it's a substantially
 
00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
it's a substantially
less

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
um footprint Financial footprint than
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
the uh sworn investigators that were
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
originally uh earmarked for this
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill um with that in mind
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative abrami was correct uh
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
192 of these uh retailers are in the
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco only category and then we look
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
at our off premise which is our
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
groceries and convenience store and
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
there's hovering around
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
14450 and I say hovering because these
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
license types are are moving targets uh
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
on a daily
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
basis um we I Ironically in the world of
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have seen the uh vape shops not uh
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
not be as successful as they were hoping
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
um our overall
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
applications uh are up
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
667 uh from the time of uh Inception of
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
the shutdown uh back in
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
March uh and and let use St Patrick's
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
Day uh to the current date uh we're
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
actually up in
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
licensees um which which is a credit to
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
our investigators and the
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
partnership uh with our lenses we've
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
taken a uh a different role of years
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
gone past and that different role is uh
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
with this partnership we find uh success
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
in not only um not only our
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh movement but our
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh our way that we
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh find that each one of these lenses is
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
actually policing themselves into
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
compliance um that starts with a
 
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.390 align:start position:0%
compliance um that starts with a
Education

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
Foundation uh and we have a a really
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
robust Education Foundation here um it
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
moves up to uh
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
violations uh if they're warranted uh
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
but uh I will tell you that uh this
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
group along with uh the alcohol side of
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
our house um are are being very Vigilant
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
themselves and in and keeping compliance
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
so we felt that uh with this in mind our
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
our first step would be uh to alter
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
these positions into examiner or uh like
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
I said earlier it's easier to keep it
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
keep track of it as calling it an
 
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:19.270 align:start position:0%
keep track of it as calling it an
auditor

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
auditor
 
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
auditor
position

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
um I uh as far as the rest of the bill
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
is concerned I'd like to bring on Aiden
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
Moore uh my colleague uh who who
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually um can speak better about some
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the movement within uh within this
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and within the original uh
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
chairman okay uh first I see
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien has a question
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you sir
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on these new
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
particular positions um I just want to
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
know if the regular liquor enforcement
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
officer is under any type of contractual
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
agreement or you know under the uh
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
protection or coverance of a a union and
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
with these two new positions greatly
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
changed the Dynamic of what that basic
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
Collective collective bargaining
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
agreement May entail and therefore may
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
lead ourselves into a down the road of a
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
an argument of uh a situation where
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe they wouldn't object if
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
these were full-time positions I just
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could elaborate on that
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
please thank you I Canen representative
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and thank you for bringing that
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
up uh to say right now that we have uh
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Union Harmony uh in this uh division is
 
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.270 align:start position:0%
Union Harmony uh in this uh division is
an

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
understatement uh both civilian and
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
sworn here work uh collaborative
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively in
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
harmony uh with with no hurdles or or
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
headaches um our civilians are covered
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh or our members if they so wish to be
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of the uh state employees union um
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
our sworn members are part of the
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
nepba um we actually have three unions
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
within us our uh commissioned officers
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh bar myself and the deputy chief are
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
part of a separate separate bargaining
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh entity within the nepba and that just
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
recently happened within the last month
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you that uh this
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
um along with a lot of other moves that
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
are that happen that might uh create
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
some hurdles between the unions have
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
have been talked about and uh this
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
endeavor uh switching these from
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh inspectors or
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
investigators uh sworn investigators
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
to um the the auditor positions or the
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
examiner positions uh was done with uh
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
no hesitation and no push back from
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
either Union president um we we actually
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
brought them into the room as part of
 
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.710 align:start position:0%
brought them into the room as part of
this

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
discussion uh thank you followup if I
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
may Mr chairman followup uh are they um
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
are the representative unions are they
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to speak in in support of
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
this uh they we did not set that up um
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
or did they offer they uh there was
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
trust that we would pass that
 
00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:12.349 align:start position:0%
trust that we would pass that
along

00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
um my the quick answer to that is uh
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
they I don't see them out there and
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion of them
 
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.190 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion of them
talking

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
ory getting at it uh thank you sir for
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%

thank you representative uh
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
representative Shu you recognize for a
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair um good
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
morning Mr armaganian um while I
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the reality I have a couple
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions number one are there any
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
current officers or I don't know if this
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
the right word employees working in this
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
position uh as auditor
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
department thank you representative uh
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
we have uh at this time three people um
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
that are working within the our auditing
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
Department that are working in the
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
positions of examiner or what I'm going
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
to call for our purposes so we don't
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
create confusion I hope I'm not creating
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
Confusion by saying this
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
Auditors um those uh current Curr those
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh three positions are actively uh
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
auditing approximately 2,000 of our Li
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
out of our 5600
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
lenses um most of it is behind the
 
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:45.109 align:start position:0%
lenses um most of it is behind the
scenes

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
scenes
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
um paperwork that is being done um there
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
is a hurdle switching this to an auditor
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
and that hurdle is if there is criminal
 
00:47:56.359 --> 00:47:57.430 align:start position:0%
and that hurdle is if there is criminal
criminal

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
liability uh which is the the reason why
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
back in the day
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
um it was it it came to fruition that uh
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the sworn um
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
investigators uh had law enforcement
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
Authority um it it would actually create
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
a circumstance that we would have to
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
bring a
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
sworn um investigator into the audit of
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
the particular ly if we had any criminal
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
audit um followup Mr chair
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um yeah that leads to
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
my next question um I have a known quite
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
a few of your former investigators or
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
officers I should say actually um
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they've all retired now
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious if um the difference
 
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.549 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious if um the difference
between

00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the immediacy of
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement of an auditor as opposed to
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
an actual uh enforcement
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
officer thank you again representative
 
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh there is an immediacy that very good
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I appreciate your background in
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
in our division um there is a issue of
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
immediacy um um when it comes to taking
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
that type of action um that is something
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
that um is I I don't want to say an
 
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
that um is I I don't want to say an
unintended

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
consequence uh it is a consequence of
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
and something that that we debated um
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't an animated debate but we
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
went back and forth on on these
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
positions and and how
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
how they could actually
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
um take this
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
action um if it did go criminal um it it
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
would take some time getting an
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
investigator a sworn investigator a
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
police officer to to the location
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
depending on where they are um there
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
could be evidence that is lost um we
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
always are are concerned with the um
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
with the exigency of of handling a case
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh immediately due to the loss of of
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
credible evidence um these these
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
Auditors would be able to take
 
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
administrative action um which um that
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
alternative um but again there's no
 
00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:50.230 align:start position:0%
alternative um but again there's no
alternative

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
to uh a uh you know a criminal entity
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and and I I like to say that 99.9 of
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
our our lenses are doing it uh extremely
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
well and I I believe that in my heart
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
but I know that uh with within that and
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
within my 33 years of law
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement um I somebody's going to
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
trip along the way and and they're
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's they're going to trip
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
because they they over served or or they
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
ered something or they sold a product
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
that in this state is
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
illegal um and that caused the compound
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
issue whether it's a fatality on the
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
roadways or um we have had um
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
altercations that have happened at some
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
of our licens
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
establishments um that criminal action
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
has had to be taken um it that does
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
create a void it 100% it creates a void
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very good point
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your honest
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
answer thank

goaly thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh just to
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
follow up uh knowing how many Auditors
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
you have how many uh investigators do
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
you have currently thank you
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh investigators right
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
now like I said uh there we have
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
approximately uh as of Friday I don't
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
have the numbers this morning uh
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
5661 active
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
lenes uh we have approximately 15
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
investigators that are in the field that
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's minus our part-time staff and um
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
our supervisory staff total we have
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
26 um that are sworn that are within
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
this division um and and our ratios are
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the area of
 
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:03.820 align:start position:0%
377 380 lenses per
 
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.390 align:start position:0%
377 380 lenses per
[Music]

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
investigator thank you followup Mr
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
up this next question I guess would go
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
towards the original bill was adding two
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
investigators and the amendment came in
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
for um to examine our positions just to
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
save on costs could you really use the
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
investigators versus the
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
examiners I if I thank you again
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh it did put a that
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't something I brought forward uh in
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
the Inception of this bill um that was
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
something that uh the committee brought
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
to me um it put a smile on my face uh
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
because our people uh like most state
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
employees do more with less um and and
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
leaving uh when I left the other job
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
over at State Police and came over here
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
I I I I was truly humbled and and
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
blessed with the the work ethic that
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
goes on here um could those yes they
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
could um and and we could use those
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
those positions as sworn um I couldn't
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
give you a barometer on if
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
if a audit went uh
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
criminal the downtime that was put in in
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of money uh that would be
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
spent on that void I don't have a
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
barometer on that but I know that um
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
just downtime and switching roles and it
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to cost something I
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if it costs the
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
difference um I'm hoping not
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and just one more followup if
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
I may Mr chair follow
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
up uh looking at the funding for the
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
positions it says shall be funded when
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
determined that the fund has received
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient additional
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue now can you explain to me is
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
once the position's in is the position
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
in and if you Revenue goes down for a
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
year or so you don't lose those
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
positions or can you explain how that
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
wording affects those
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
positions um it was my understanding uh
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative it was my
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that once those ear marks
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
were met the position was in place as a
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a permanent position um uh I don't I
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
I didn't think about that being a a
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
position in
 
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.789 align:start position:0%
position in
Jeopardy

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess the way I read it not I guess
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
the way I read it was that that position
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
was in in place and it was just to get
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
those were the a marks that were set
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
just to get that position into
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
place thank you thank you uh
 
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.549 align:start position:0%
place thank you thank you uh

inclusive I don't have the breakdown
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
individually um on premise uh we're
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
looking at uh just under
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
2,000 um
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
1,450 and then you have the 192 as the
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
Standalone ret s tobacco um of that um
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
the division brings in for license fees

followup

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so the other part of
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
my question was um are these the fees
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
that you that are in this bill are those
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
um it says license fees are those annual
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
or is it a one time with a renewal and
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
um also did the
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
agency give any consideration to
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
suggesting higher tobacco fees for those
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
places sorry about that I got a little
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
feedback here
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
the second part of your
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
question um was there consideration to
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
that I think it was very
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
um there was very quick consideration
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
given to that a reason being a couple
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
years back I say a couple years probably
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
further it was not during my term uh
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
with with the previous Chief um that was
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
attempted and and it it fell pretty
 
00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:27.270 align:start position:0%
attempted and and it it fell pretty
quickly

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
um the industry had
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
concerns um uh there were a lot of uh
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives that we went in front of
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
at the time that had great concerns over
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
it um and at that point it it it didn't
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
go anywhere so we we decided not to even
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
down

00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.349 align:start position:0%

fees there are no other questions sir I
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
I have one question for
 
01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:18.829 align:start position:0%
I have one question for
you

01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the it wasn't clear from the bill
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
whether these were tobacco or liquor
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
investigators and the reason I deleted
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
the positions with that amendment is
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
that my connections in the hospitality
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
industry think there are too many liquor
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
investigators at the moment do you have
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
any response to that I I do
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much for
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
your your comment um I we just twofold
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh first of all um the information I
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
have uh on the lad that you said from uh
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
from our
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
licensees uh it conversely is the
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
opposite um and and that's even in our
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh Google surveys that we do uh on a
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
daily basis um management and ownership
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
when they're not in their
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
establishments want want to know that
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
their business is being done right and
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
want that
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
um want to be good in their heart that
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
that um they're they're not their
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't being run in a fashion
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
that would create liability from for
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
themselves um since I've come in um the
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
only thing I have heard from our lenses
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
is that um we that they want us to have
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
more people not less um and and uh this
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
is actually the first time I've heard uh
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
heard this in four years that uh they
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
want us to have less
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
investigators um I I will tell you and I
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
will put you in contact with with the
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
people um it's the direct opposite um
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
they want to have that confidence when
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're not there that their
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
establishments are being run right and
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we are spot checking them on a
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
nightly basis
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%

ratio of 380 to one am I am I
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly as far uh
 
01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
the the last numbers I have of of course
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh please understand that this number
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
these lenses numbers move daily I get it
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
um the last number I have is actually 33
 
01:03:05.799 --> 01:03:07.230 align:start position:0%
um the last number I have is actually 33
uh

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
3774 to one cl enough yep all right how
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
does that compare to
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
um even the New England region as far as
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of the other states go what do they
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
typically see averages between uh lenes
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
and your your office in that ratio range
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
or or is it something else no it it very
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
typical sir thank you very much for that
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
question uh and that's nationally uh not
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
just in New England um there are several
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh states that actually are set up
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
identical and and some are even more
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
robust than us um the Washington State
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
um has I think in the area the last I
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
checked ad investigators sworn
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%

substance misuse prevention policies and
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
um particularly arounds one that deter
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
substance misuse among Youth and Young
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
adults so the um uh vaping epidemic is
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
some people uh refer to it it was on our
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
radar for many years and we've been
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
working very closely with um the New
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission other
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
partners and um New Hampshire Ways and
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
Means on different bills around this um
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
so I will be very brief and just say we
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
are supportive of HB 591 there was a lot
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
of work that went into it with the ways
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
and means committee we are very
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
supportive of the Liquor Commission
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
having the resources that they need to
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
support um it's the new somewhat new
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they have around um
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco and vaping and um the
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement at age 21 so I would ask the
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee to pass this bill and pass it
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
on to Ways and Means where they have had
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience with um looking at
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue of this bill and the need um
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
and that's really all I have to say and
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
we ask the committee to support this and
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
a question um we have the original Bill
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
591 and I believe this morning he
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
introduced Amendment
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:14.029 align:start position:0%
introduced Amendment
21-

01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
21-
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
0116 so I'm not
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
sure uh what of which of these uh bills
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh you would like me to address or that
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
when um his committee last year uh
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
looked at the whole issue of vape shops
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
there was quite a bit of legislation
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
that came through around ecigarettes
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
and The Lure of those businesses that um
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
were um selling uh Vape products and who
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
were at that point in time
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
unregulated the bill that came initially
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
591 in our review of this bill uh
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
proposes two things it would repeal the
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
$6 fee that tobacco licenses pay
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
currently and replace it uh on your bill
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
lines 7 through 13 with a fee
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
schedule which essentially
 
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
schedule which essentially
mirrors

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
mirrors
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
the uh pricing for what is referred to
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
as combination lies that are businesses
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
that hold a license to sell alcohol wine
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
17818 under
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
591 if the $6 fee were
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
replaced with this fee schedule and I'll
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
use an example just to illustrate what
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
the impact would
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
be a convenient store that has a single
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
register uh and has a license to sell
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol would pay
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
$336 under 591 If This Were to
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
pass they would no longer pay the
 
01:10:37.239 --> 01:10:38.669 align:start position:0%
pass they would no longer pay the
additional

01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
$6 for the tobacco license they would
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
pay an additional
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
$336 for a tobacco
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
license so they would essentially would
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
pay 336 for their alcohol license and
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
add IAL 336 for a tobacco
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
license I don't believe excuse me I
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe that was the intent um of
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
the uh bill when it was initially
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
introduced but the way
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
591 was written that is the way it would
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
be interpreted and applied if it became
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
law with that information we sat down
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
and and also excuse me before I proceed
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
to the amendment uh 591 also has the two
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
investigator positions in it and has as
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
its required uh
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
Milestones the the requirement that the
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
um establishment of the two positions is
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
linked to revenue that is brought in as
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
a result of this fee
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
change if you were to look at the uh
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill as it's written where by my example
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
a business would pay
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
$336 for a alcohol license and an
 
01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
$336 for a alcohol license and an
additional

01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
$336 for their tobacco license and
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
that's also a business that has just one
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
register you can see in in the initial
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill that there is a a scale that
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of the licenses uh
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
based upon the number of registers the
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
legislative policy I believe was to say
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
the bigger the business the more
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
registers you have the more you're able
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
to sell alcohol Therefore your fee
 
01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
to sell alcohol Therefore your fee
should

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
increase so if the if you looked at
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
591 um it's very possible that those
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
Milestones could be achieved because the
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
revenue that would be coming in would be
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than what exists
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
currently um it seems unlikely that
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
there may be an interest in
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
increasing um those tobacco
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
fees uh for a business that holds a
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
license to sell alcohol already to this
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
new level and therefore um we worked
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
with representative abrami to bring
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
about what we believe was the probably
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
the intended
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
consequence to leave the increases the
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the new fee schedule for those
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
businesses that do not hold a license to
 
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.149 align:start position:0%
businesses that do not hold a license to
sell

01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and if um Madame chair if it's
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
possible could I directly um I know
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
everybody does not have the amendment so
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
I guess my question was how would you
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
like me to address what is included in
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment and how it is
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
591 do your best I so if I do I
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly to say that
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
instead of Simply doubling the alcohol
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
fee the amendment gives you gradated
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco fees for tobacco only
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
businesses yes ma'am the you will you
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
would see in the amendment uh that
 
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative abrami was bringing that
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
we have now included language that would
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
say uh to the business that holds an
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol license I'll use the same
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
example the convenience store that has a
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
license to sell beer and wine for
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
$336 under lines
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
11-13 of the amendment any business that
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
holds a license to sell alcohol would
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
continue to pay only $6 for their
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
license so the unintended consequence of
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
591 would be
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
dampened and the only businesses that
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
would be paying the adjusted fee would
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
be those businesses that are tobacco
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
only and in this you'll see that 591 for
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
example has has a single registered fee
 
01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
example has has a single registered fee
of

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
$336 under representative of rami's
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
$216 and the rationale behind that is a
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
combination beer and wine license is
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
essentially paying a license for a
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
license to sell two products so if they
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
were not going to sell two products we
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
do have a model in a license type that
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
we offer called a wine retailer where a
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
wine retail license would only pay would
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
pay a reduced amount because they're
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
only selling one product so we felt that
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that was a fair
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
comparison and a fair approach and
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
therefore in the amendment on lines
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
three through six you'll see a fee
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
schedule different from 591 lower but it
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
represents that fee schedule which
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
exists currently for a wine retailer
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
license now of course that fee
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
adjustment in that I spoke about leaving
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
the retailers with a $6 fee if they hold
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
an alcohol
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
license and only looking at Revenue
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
new Revenue coming from the retail
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco only
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
business I it would it would be almost
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
impossible for the division to reach its
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
Milestones to establish investigator
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
positions as as Chief armaganian stated
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
as representative abramy stated these
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
are very expensive
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
positions um I think in past last year
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
we provided his committee with fiscal
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
worksheet IND those positions were going
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
to be approximately
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
134,000 each um as opposed to what would
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
be the cost to establish a civilian
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
examiner position and the fact that um
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
these positions are really uh often
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring compliance and Revenue
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
collection and that therefore the more
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are the more positions there are
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure the revenue is coming in uh
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
the greater likelihood that nothing
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
slips through the cracks and that all
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
the revenue that the state is due is
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
collected um I believe Chief armaganian
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
has um looked at some costs associated
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
with examiner positions
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
versus uh investigator
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
positions and so I would defer certainly
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
to him if you have additional questions
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
on that those
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
costs but I hope I've done a a credible
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
job of trying to distinguish the
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
challenges of
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
591 and what we believe the Cure would
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
be that would come through with
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative Abram's
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
questions okay I see representative
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
abramy to speak is there anyone else
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
with questions so sorry representative
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I thank you madam chair I
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
just wondered it would be a lot easier
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
to understand if we had a little handout
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
that with examples of the different
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of um establishments and what they
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
pay reprentative fellows you're
 
01:18:46.679 --> 01:18:47.870 align:start position:0%
pay reprentative fellows you're
absolutely

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
correct we that is however the province
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
of ways and means we are to to look at
 
01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
the general policy rather than the
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
details of the fees and the
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
revenue they this bill will be going to
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means after if we if we pass it
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
so they will be examining the details of
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
the fees so um Madam chair I was
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
interested my perspective was the impact
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
on those local businesses that's why I
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
was interested in seeing that
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I understand and I
 
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.070 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I understand and I
appreciate

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh Mr mois examples that showed that the
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
original bill was going to double their
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
fees whereas the
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
amendment makes no change to to existing
 
01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
amendment makes no change to to existing
um

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
agencies so I think that in that POS
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
alone we have to support the amendment
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with the uh with our
 
01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.270 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with the uh with our
local

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.189 align:start position:0%
 
businesses

01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
still we've got the original bill and
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
the Amendments and so I'm just not clear
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
what happens what the fees turn out to
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios fine we will dis discuss this
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
further in executive session if you
 
01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
further in executive session if you
don't

01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
raming yes thank you madam chair for
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak a second time uh
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
repr fellows uh go to section go to RSA
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
17829 Roman 2 and you will see the fee
 
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
schedules currently actually it's it's
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
actually if you look at the whole
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
section there's three pages of fees that
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
are all over the place so it's an
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
interesting view um Madame chair I just
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment about the um the
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
trigger in the bill uh came from
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
Finance uh and I can't exactly remember
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
the sequence of events last term but uh
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
we we did our work and then uh the when
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
it came to the new positions our bill
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
was not scheduled the bill was not
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go to finance so we called
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
finance and and they gave us that
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
language about the triggers just so you
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
know actually when it comes to these
 
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
know actually when it comes to these
positions

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
technically Edna or waying means this is
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
really a this is really a finance
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
question if you want to be technical
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
about it so um and I think uh again
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's really only one thing in this
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill that has to do with Edna and that's
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
is there a retail tobacco
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
license and and everything else in this
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
bill is either a Ways and Means question
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
as the chair has mentioned or a finance
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
question um and there is thank you
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative AB brami I was wondering
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
why this bill showed up in this
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in the first place I I agree
 
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:08.500 align:start position:0%
and I I talked I
 
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
and I I talked I
[Music]

01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
talked the bill that the person with the
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
themselves go on representative of Ramy
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes technically this is a way it means
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
Bell I'm fact we were surprised when we
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
saw an Edna and I I know represented
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
major contacted you and you said well we
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
we got the bill so we're going to deal
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
with it so so um hopefully uh you'll
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
you'll pass one version of this um if
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
you want to deal with Madam chair if you
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
want to deal with my Amendment uh that'd
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
be fine uh if not I can deal with it
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
when hopefully you passed the bill so we
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
can uh correct this again in in the
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
intent the reason for the the major
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
reason for the amendment is that we
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
really wanted to tighten the language up
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
after we relooked at it uh I was
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
contacted by Aiden and uh uh Moore and
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
and Chief amanian and I I worked with
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
them for the last month on going through
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
it and coming up with this amendment to
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that that the the current
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
licenses with liquor licenses aren't
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
going to be double charged for uh having
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
the tobacco license we're now convinced
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
that now the language is correct so
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's what this Amendment does for the
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
most part thank you we will be studying
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
that Amendment prior to executing this
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill because clearly it's a a an
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
improvement over the original yes thank
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
you and I I did forward that Amendment
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
through what I thought was the proper
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
way which was through the uh testimony
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
thing that they
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%

purchase use and possession of tobacco
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
um we support the repeal of these which
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does have a law for this
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
um because they are ineffective at
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
deterring youth initiation of tobacco
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
and um and often are in equitably
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
implemented um against youth from
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
lowincome communities as well as youth
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
of color um and you know basically

groups um and these thank you miss vau
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
certification what it does
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
is re it establishes that all of the
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
licenses are twoe rather than
 
01:28:39.119 --> 01:28:41.470 align:start position:0%
licenses are twoe rather than
one

01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.189 align:start position:0%
one
and

01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and they
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
expire on one's birthday ra the month
 
01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.629 align:start position:0%
expire on one's birthday ra the month
month's

01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
month's
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
birthday um
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
rather than at a specific date some of
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
the boards were all expiring in May or
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
efficient this is a and it establishes
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
that the board the director of oplc has
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
the authority to set the micro the feeds
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the license fees rather than the
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
boards they still have their technical
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
Authority discipline and so forth they
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
issu essentially this bill cleans up
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
some old language and is an efficiency
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement for the oplc it has
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
no technical changes whatsoever There's
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
um how they will phase out the the old
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
licenses and renew them they're they're
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
um they have partial fees for partial
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
years that they will be renewing and
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's it you have if you have any
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
technical any questions I'll try to
 
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.229 align:start position:0%
technical any questions I'll try to
answer

01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
them right does any member of the
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee have a question for
 
01:30:13.119 --> 01:30:17.910 align:start position:0%
committee have a question for

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
McGuire being No Hands the chair is

01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
second Miss Kelly you should be able to
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
speak good morning Mr chair and members
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Tina Kelly
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
and I am here representing the office of
 
01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
oplc this bill is designed as
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire stated to
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
standardized renewals and we're doing
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
those in small groups the first group is
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
the 12 that are listed there to ensure
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
ease of transition from um a standard
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
month of renewal to having them renew
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
across the year and the renewal would be
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
done two years from the date of initial
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
lure and in doing that we're going to
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that all boards or all licenses
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
who get license will get a complete
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
two-year license there will be no need
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
to prate fees and no need to prate
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
continuing education it should make it
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
easier for the Len he to understand and
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
to comply with and it'll also make it
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
easier for oplc to administer spreading
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
out the renewals across the year and not
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
Jewish doing them in all in June or all
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
in November so it it should make um for
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
both lenses and oplc life much
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
easier um the transition is the only
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
time there is pro rating and that is to
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that the um lensey being switched
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
from their set time of renewal to the
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
two-year from initial licensure they
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
would get a um license for two years
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
plus however months however many months
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that way um they they're insured
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
years um I think that pretty much covers
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
it and I'm here to take any
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Miss Kelly
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question thises yes
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative gr thank you um Miss
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
Kelly could you please explain the
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of having the director set the
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
fees versus the Board
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh good question that has already
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
actually been set in another statute
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
where the um director of oplc has the
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
authority or to set those
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
fees um we're getting ready to clarify
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
that in another bill change because a
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the boards have it set right in
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
their statute so that'll be um clarified
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
in other statute but what it'll be able
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do is keep us within that 125% of
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
operating costs and ensure that um
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're that lenses are not paying more
 
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
than what they're um require they should
 
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:36.830 align:start position:0%
than what they're um require they should
be

01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
paying okay do I have any other
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and I have
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
attendees representative
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
curious as to where the boards stand on
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
these changes that these are
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
affecting oh great question now before I
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
took my position my my new position with
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
oplc I was the administrator of the
 
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
Allied Health boards and those seven
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
boards um we had worked on very very
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
similar legislation to switch them
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
over um last year and as we all know
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
that a lot of things were tabled and
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
this was one of them so as far as those
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
seven boards go they are on board with
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
this I have not spoken directly to the
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
other boards but this will not take away
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
any Authority that they have it just
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
changes their time of
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh I think uh one of the
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
statements you made is this is currently
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
being done and due to changes in other
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
statutes um just questioning how then
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
why is
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation needed if you're
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
currently doing it or how are you doing
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
it if this legislation hasn't
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
passed no that was only the fees so only
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
the fees which the director off oplc
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
has the authority to set is set in other
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
statute um it may be unclear in certain
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
places and that is what's being worked
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
on just that um clarification for the
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
authority of oplc to set the
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions from the
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing no questions from
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
attendees I'm going to close up public
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
94

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:37:39.310 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
he's got to
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.199 --> 01:38:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
panelist

01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
har okay we're gonna go ahead and open
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
70 the chair calls representative
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
Maguire to introduce
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you Mr chair the house
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill 70 is a repeat of a bill that
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
passed the house last year on consent
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this committee on consent and died
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the Senate due
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
to one thing or another it microblading
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
of eyebrows is a permanent makeup
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
technique that is considered tattooing
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
because it involves breaking into the
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
skin it is a very simple version of
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
tattooing and right now this cosmetic
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
procedure requires a complete tattoo
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
artist license which requires a minimum
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
of onee
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
apprentice some people want
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
to to do this with less than
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
that and so I worked at a constituent
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
request and I worked with the T the body
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
art board to discover how to do
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
that they decided that the a licensed
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist or an
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
esthetician has a lot of the
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
basic annotation in dealing with faces
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so that they would
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
need only a
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.790 align:start position:0%
need only a
simplified

01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
simplified
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
course they to safely perform
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
microblading so this language is what
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
that board gave to me last year
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it authorizes a
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
certificate which is an addendum to the
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
aestheticians or cosmetologist license
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
that this person has attended the class
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
and passed the test and uh meets the
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
that meets the the board of body Arts
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
requirements for sanitation and and
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
technique Bill gives them the rules
 
01:40:36.119 --> 01:40:37.870 align:start position:0%
technique Bill gives them the rules
to

01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh apply the forms performance standards
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
in work and
 
01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:44.870 align:start position:0%
in work and
disciplinary

01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
requirements there is no additional
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
effort required on the part of the Board
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
of Cosmetology
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
they have their their regular ones
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
and that's all I I have to say if you
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
answer does any member of the uh
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%

health and safety in our state my name
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
is Ryan wette I have been a licensed
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
body art practitioner and business owner
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for over 20 years in
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
addition to running my business I am
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
also a member of the state's body art
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board which supports the office

of professional lure and certification
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
the oplc with supervision of tattooing
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
and bodypiercing services here in New
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in July of 2019 I was tasked
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
with writing and delivering a
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
presentation about the risks of
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
microblading for state legislators and
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
oplc since microblading is a relatively
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
newer service it has not yet clearly
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
been defined by the state of New
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are understanding of those
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the body art industry looking
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
to offer a potentially lucrative service
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
such as microblading but through the
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
lens of what we do as licensed body art
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
practitioners the service commonly
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
referred to as microblading is very
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
clearly cosmetic tattooing presenting
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
microblading as a service Under the
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
Umbrella of Cosmetology or other
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
professions that do not primarily work
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
with broken skin or blood May
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
misrepresent or underscore some of the
 
01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:45.229 align:start position:0%
misrepresent or underscore some of the
risks

01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
risks
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
involved in body art terms microblading
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
clearly falls under the definition of
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
tattooing which in New Hampshire is any
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
indelible Mark made upon the skin
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
through use of pigment or Scar Tissue
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
the term microblading refer refers to a
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
service where the skin is broken by a
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
device with a sharp edge and pigment is
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
inserted the sharp Implement is very
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
fine and can replicate the look of a
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
sculpted eyebrow hair uh I feel the need
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify that this procedure does in
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
fact break the skin which can produce
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
bleeding and all the safety concerns
 
01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:17.719 align:start position:0%
caused by a bleeding wound while I
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
understand and respect the investment of
 
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
time training undergone by those in the
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and esthetician Fields
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
including their General hygiene
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
practices I do have concerns that their
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
existing training does not sufficiently
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
prepare them to perform Services
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
involving broken skin and bleeding on a
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
daily basis hp70 lays out a type of
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
certification exemption for
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist to add microblading to
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
their services unfortunately that
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
certification is the make or break
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
factor of this issue without a clear
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
standard of acceptable certification in
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Our concern is that much
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the available training for
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
microblading falls into the weekend
 
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
seminar or expedited learning category
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
and service providers may not receive a
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient level of training to protect
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
the public health for contrast those in
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire body art industry have
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
undergone a minimum one-year
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship to offer services that
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
involve broken skin while a
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
certification may offer sufficient
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
training to offer microblading without
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
knowing the standards of that
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
certification the body art advisory
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
panel cannot support this bill as it is
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
written so my current uh position is to
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
oppose hb70 this statute would in a way
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
deregulate cosmetic tattooing by
 
01:44:25.629 --> 01:44:25.639 align:start position:0%
allowing it to be performed by those
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire lure and
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
supervision for body art we understand
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
those looking to offer a service in
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
demand however my first concern must be
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
to protect public health and safety in
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the body Ard Advisory
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
Board continues to research microblading
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
and its available training and will
 
01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
continue to advise the oplc on this
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
matter for input or questions related to
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
microblading practitioners in either
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or body artart can contact
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
the office of professional Li insurance
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
and certification through oplc nh.gov I
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
matter thank you Mr wette does anyone
 
01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
wette I've had raised my hand I see you
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman uh Mr
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
well Willet I'm deeply grateful for your
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
appearance before us today because uh
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
although I don't profess to have any
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
expertise um in this particular skill
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
this particular art uh I am deeply
 
01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh the amount of
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
training that would be necessary to
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
perform this uh not only effectively but
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
safely uh and as a member of this
 
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee for uh now 15 years I have
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
seen examples of uh members of the
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
public who have been harmed by inexpert
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh treatment of some aspect of their
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
face um and I'm I'm very concerned so
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony is very uh insightful to
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
me with regard to the amount of training
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
that would be required for someone who
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
is even as as much skill and training as
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
in involved in cosmetology and
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
aesthetician uh Services uh the extra
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
aspect of breaking the skin um and and
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
involving blood uh is of considerable
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
concern to me so can you expand on the
 
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
amount of additional training in terms
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
of time and coursework that you believe
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
would be required uh in order for
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
someone with a CO cosmet ology or
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
esthetician basis to be sufficiently
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
skilled in the additional aspects you
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
reference and I'm referencing in my
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
question in order to do this safely but
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
also effectively because this is not
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
just uh a tattoo on an arm a back or
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
whatever but it's on very close to the
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
eye and it would be extremely visible uh
 
01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
and it disfigurement is something that
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
I'm also very concerned about I I think
 
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
with your background as a tattoo artist
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh that you're uniquely qualified to
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
speak to this issue so could you please
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
help us with this uh yes sir uh
 
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's it's kind of a
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
state-to-state issue by what
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
certification means uh there are some
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
states that that might not be very
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
engaged in the process at all they might
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
allow someone to take uh a simple
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
weekend seminar and then start offering
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
these Services immediately uh other
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
states might have certification that
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
falls into the uh weeks if not months of
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
training x amount of hours 100 hours 500
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
hours it it it varies quite a bit state
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
byst state they don't have um Universal
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
training certifications uh for the the
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
entire nation so what I would prefer to
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
see in New Hampshire is for us to Define
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
um minimum training certification
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirements uh because I I also
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't feel comfortable with someone
 
01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
being able to offer a service where they
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
B basically cut and aaid the the face
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
with only a weekends of training so
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
while I I fully respect the the work
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
that cosmetologists and and
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
aestheticians do to um to pursue their
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
Craft um it does take some specialty
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
training to understand well how do you
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that that wound heals without
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
an infection how do you make sure that
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
you're fully disinfecting your your work
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
surfaces and and your equipment for the
 
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
the next client uh and without having a
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
clear definition of what that training
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
is for New Hampshire uh it it's not
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
something that I can I can support at
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
this time our advisory panel our
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
Advisory board for body art um has been
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
researching training available in other
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
states and it's a a very confusing issue
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
because some states are completely
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
unregulated some states are heavily
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
regulated some states fall in the middle
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
um we can start to pull
 
01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
information uh but then we have to say
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
well what what training facilities are
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
going to be available to someone
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire if there are
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
no current microblading schools in New
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what are we expecting people
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
to do to go down to maybe another state
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
where they can knock this out in a few
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
hours or to go to a state where they
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
would have to commute and and do several
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
weeks if not months of of
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
training uh due to covid uh that can
 
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
also potentially limit available
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
training because procedures that involve
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
broken skin on someone's face would
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
typically require in-person training
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
that might not be available right now so
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a difficult and complicated
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
issue um if hb70 were to pass without
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
defining that certification it could
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
potentially create a moment where we um
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
are asking people to operate under the
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
honor System alone and while I do
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
respect people working in New Hampshire
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't necessarily feel that
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
that would make me comfortable as far as
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
uh the terms of public health and safety
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman yes go ahead
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so am I correct that although
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetician Services uh
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
at first blush no pun intended uh seem
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat similar that are they not
 
01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:38.679 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different uh crafts with
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
regard to what is involved in Breaking
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
the skin um and in in and in injecting
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
if you will some kind of
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
permanent um
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
pigmentation uh aspect into the eyebrow
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
are they not fundamentally
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
different uh yes sir I would believe
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
that they are fundamentally different
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
some of the specific questions related
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
to cosmetology might be better served to
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
someone on one of their uh advisory
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
bodies but as far as body art goes um if
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're performing a service that is is
 
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
going to cause bleeding um we have lots
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
of training our our entire studios are
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
designed to be able to man manage that
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
bleeding safely to prevent infections we
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
have entire sterilization rooms in our
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
Studios if we're not working fully
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
disposa we have a very specific setup
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
very specific criteria for for
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
disinfection training and that's all
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's all done through a a one-on-one
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
face-to-face apprenticeship process so
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
someone observes for x amount of hours
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
someone performs under supervision for x
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
amount of hours this isn't something
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's being done in an expedited
 
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
fashion so I I I would certainly uh urge
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
the the cosmetology uh governing bodies
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
and advisory panels to also get involved
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
in this conversation but as someone
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
whose background is is clearly rooted in
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
in body art um I I very firmly see
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
microblading as tattooing and then I
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
start to see all of the issues that
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
would arise offering a safe tattoo
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
service and I wouldn't feel comfortable
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
offering some of those services with
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
potentially just a weekend's worth of
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
training just one quick followup Mr qu
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr wette would you be
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
available to uh to this committee uh for
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
future reference and guidance uh on this
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
very complex subject yes sir I'm always
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%

belt dealt with this bill in the 2020
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
session but my memory of uh our hearing
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
on it is rather dim uh did you or from
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%

that bill uh to my knowledge no one from
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
the body art advisory panel was was part
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
of that hearing there may have been
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
someone from the cosmetology board um we
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
do share one member on the body art

board with the the cosmetology board so
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's possible that they might have been
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%

written testimony um that Mr wette did
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
not point out in
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
opposition um to start I'm majority

in cosmetic and paramal Tech
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
toing um I have over 230 hours of
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
training in paramedical tattooing as
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
well as 3,000 hours in both my apprenti
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
from both my
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um this Pro this proposed
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill has the potential to greatly
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
interfere with the livelihood of many
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
tattoo practitioners who are licensed to
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
microblade and already offer this Tech
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
technique as also and equally important
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
it also poses a certain threat to the
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
public as Mr L did bring
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
up um
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
microblading is a tattoo technique in
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
which tight a tight grouping of inline
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
needles are used to open the skin at the
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
level of the upper dermis to place
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
pigment the technique has Associated
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
risks that include but are not limited
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
to cutting too deep into the Derm RIS
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
which can cause not only severe scarring
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
but also blurring of the tattoo Line
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
work these two things combined can lead
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
to the disfigurement of a client's face
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
proper dep is depth is something that
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
tattoo practitioners are well trained in
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
knowing and and feeling however it can
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
take a long time to establish the fill
 
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
through proper tattoo apprenticeship and
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of Hands-On
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
training in an earlier language used by
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
the body art advisor Advisory board at a
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
meeting on 125 2019 I quote the board
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
generally agreed to permit an exemption
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
for estheticians to perform microblading
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
with a powered machine only this is
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
concerning as microblade is not
 
01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
performed with a machine this is is an
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
example of how easy it is to mistake
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
microblading for other te 2
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%

01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%

01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%

their chosen tattoo practitioner and
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately they would have be forced to

seek out less qualified individuals to

honorable members of the
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee I appear before the committee
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
today in support of House Bill 70 as
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember I served on
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
this committee last session
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
as representative Maguire said at the
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
time this bill at that time the bill was
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
heard before the committee and was
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
reported out as ought to pass the house
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
passed the bill and the legislation was
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
sent to the Senate unfortunately the
 
02:02:10.069 --> 02:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
bill got caught up in the covid epidemic
 
02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
and ended up not being included in this
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
Senate omnus bill at the end of the
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
session I am
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
a beneficiary of
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
microblading after being diagnosed with
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
breast cancer followed by surgery and
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
radiation I lost my
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
eyebrows while that surgery and
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
radiation treatment were successful my
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
appearance was
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
concerning well I cannot deny there was
 
02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
some vanity involved I can honestly tell
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
you that my decision to turn to
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
microblading was very much a part of my
 
02:02:49.709 --> 02:02:49.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic therapy
 
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
thery after this procedure I felt that I
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
was truly back to my old
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
self this procedure should be available
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
to members of the public at a reasonable
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
cost I truly
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
believe that this is not a tattoo and my
 
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
research has definitely proved that to
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
be true the procedure is much different
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
than a normal tattoo and I have to add
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
of which I have
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
had I urge the members of the committee
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill 70 and send it to
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
the house floor as ought to pass thank
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative uh is
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee there being none I thank you
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%

02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
attendees Mr chairman you may ask a
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
procedural question absolutely go ahead
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%

02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
anybody among the attendees who who is a
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
currently practicing
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
microblader um other than Miss Smith uh
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
who was already testified but um I would
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
like to hear having especially having
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
heard from The Honorable Kathy Darden uh
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
with regard to the importance of having
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
microblading available to the citizens I
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from so from other
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
practitioners if they are here with
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
regard to the requirements so that we
 
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
can uh can move forward in a proper
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
manner uh thank you for the question
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know that there's
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
any way I could determine who among the
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
attendees was a practicing microblader
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to go forward with
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
the people that have signed up to speak
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
or raising their hand and perhaps we'll
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
get lucky that way um so I recognize
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
Holly Rodriguez if you un unmute your
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
microphone hi good morning my name is
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
Holly Rodriguez I'm I'm in the capacity
 
02:05:14.549 --> 02:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
of um representing myself however I am
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
the board chair for the Board of
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology and
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
atics and um we did discuss this at our
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
board but we did not have time before
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
this meeting to have a proper board
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
meeting or have a um a a board Quorum so
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
we could discuss it so I am coming forth
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
to this um to your representatives um as
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
myself and I do I am in favor of this
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
bill however I do think I agree with um
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
Ryan wette that I think that there
 
02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
should be some more than just a weekend
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
training I think that you have
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
esthetician and cosmetologist who are
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
very well suited and and can do some
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
credible um sanitation and disinfect um
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's what they do that's what they
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
learn at school that's what they they
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
have sharp containers if they use l sets
 
02:06:03.470 --> 02:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
or anything like that they have those
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
things in their rooms now um I do
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the semi-permanent
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
tattooing that's done for sparse
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
eyebrows utilizing a hand tool not a
 
02:06:15.549 --> 02:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
mechanical tool would be something with
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the proper education that a
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist or ES could could do to um
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
be able to assist the public and have
 
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
other people able to perform this
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
procedure right now the only way for
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
someone to do that is to Apprentice with
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
a tattoo artist who primarily not all of
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
them are doing just eyebrow tattoos so
 
02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
right now there's no there's nothing in
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
any law that says say I was going to go
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to Apprentice with a tattoo
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
artist to get this I could have I could
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
do my apprenticeship
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
with any tattoo artist doing regular
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
tattoos on people's arms and legs and
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
backs and chest but not on the face
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
whereas if we're able to make this
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
training appropriate you'd be able to
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
cater this so when people are getting
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
trained and getting apprenticed with
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
whatever we feel is the right thing it's
 
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
mandated to be right on what they're
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to be training on not apprenticing
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
with a tattoo artist who may be doing
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
backs arms legs and doing permanent you
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
more permanent Tattooing in a very
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
different very different way than if
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
someone's doing it on their eyebrows
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
which is a very cosmetic application so
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that um representative Smith
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
and um also with Ryan roulette I do
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
agree with what they're saying that
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
there should be some more than one
 
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
weekend I think that it definitely needs
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
to be you know maybe a a cboard
 
02:07:39.390 --> 02:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
situation that we could come up with
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
what we felt a syllabus would be
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for we've done that with
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
other things such as tanning uh tanning
 
02:07:46.350 --> 02:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
and other things that we wanted to make
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
sure they had the appropriate training
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so I do think it's something that can
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
be done and I also believe that with
 
02:07:56.589 --> 02:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics having their
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
license um based on sanitation and
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
sterilization that they would be an
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate person to work with this
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetic application with the
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate training so I am in favor of
 
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
questions if you have
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh representative
 
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
Fells thank you Mr chair um Miss Ro
 
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
Fells thank you Mr chair um Miss Ro
rodri

02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
rodri
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that um somebody who has
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
who's certified in
 
02:08:29.709 --> 02:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
cosmetology would have a step up over a
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
per just any person taking the required
 
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
training absolutely because they already
 
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
have almost o over a year of schooling
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
on sanitation and sterilization they
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
already know that they do that they're
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
inspected by our state board which we
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
have two inspection inspectors that go
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
out and inspect these um these lies
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
these New Hampshire lenses just on their
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
sterilization and sanitation so if
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's still upstanding lenes in our
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
state they they have already that
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
background of Sanitation and
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
sterilization and keeping our Public
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question as I look at the
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think this was all
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
discussed last year and
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
why uh most of us voted to move this
 
02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
forward um the new paragraph is under
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
body art and rul making and the
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph says that the requirements to
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
obain and renew for microblading include
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
application forms and approval
 
02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.669 align:start position:0%
application forms and approval
microblading

02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
microblading
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
courses so my question goes we're hear
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
about everybody throwing out there a
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
weekend course or a day course and that
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been defined yet it's going to be
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
The Bodyguard folks from what I see here
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
who come forward with the rulle
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
making is that not the case or am I
 
02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:07.189 align:start position:0%
making is that not the case or am I
missing

02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
something it was my understanding uh rep
 
02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie that the um
 
02:10:14.549 --> 02:10:14.559 align:start position:0%
because we do have one of those members
 
02:10:16.549 --> 02:10:16.559 align:start position:0%
on our board as well as a P public
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
member and that they were
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
making the syllabus of what they felt
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
was appropriate once this was as an
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and what they thought was
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
an appropriate syllabus
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
for it to be followed by aesthetic and
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
Cosmetology licens in the state of New
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's why I we didn't have
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
a meeting um before because we thought
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
that that was already kind of figured
 
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
out so I'm coming on here representing
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
myself but I too had already thought
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
that that was the way it was going to be
 
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
that they were going to mandate what
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
they felt was the most important and
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
what needed to be followed in that
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
syllabus and it wasn't a timeline it was
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
more of what needed to be
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
followed thank you and just one followup
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
followup I agree and wouldn't you agree
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
that also the other requirement
 
02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
standards of hygiene for performing
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
microblading uh writing rules on that
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
procedure too would be suffice to cover
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
safe are you asking me representative
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
am yes absolutely I think that is
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
something that that these lenses already
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
have in their practice and just that's
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
something to for them to expound on and
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
and grow on and they already have that
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
as their base of their license as it is
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
if they're already an upstanding license
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
SE so it's something they're already
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
practicing thank
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
you you're welc thank you any further
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions for M Rodriguez uh
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Rodriguez
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being with us
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
this morning um uh I respect your
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
position as a the chair of the
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
cosmetology board um and and
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
so I noticed that in the statute and in
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that this is under body art
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
and not under
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
cosmetology um so uh the question I have
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
for you is that the work that
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and aestheticians do uh
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
is uh is is that permanent changes to
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
the to the facial features of the the
 
02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.830 align:start position:0%
the to the facial features of the the
the

02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
client uh representative it is a
 
02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
semi-permanent um application and it's
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
done with a hand tool so it is a little
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
bit different and it does it definitely
 
02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
does require um more education which is
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
what the border of tattooing was um
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
implying that they had they were putting
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
together so uh but it is more than one
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
step process sir so it's not just one
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
time um it's you know usually it's a
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
multiple um times they they do the first
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and then within six weeks or
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
so they get a second treatment and then
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
that is not a permanent um thing that's
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be touched up
 
02:13:14.109 --> 02:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
but it definitely is a craft that needs
 
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
to be that needs to be acquired as with
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
any other artistic craft
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you Mr chairman
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
so what I'm getting at is that that uh
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
women like frequently to change their
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
hairstyle or their look for an evening
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
engagement or a party or a big big du
 
02:13:39.549 --> 02:13:39.559 align:start position:0%
wedding or something like that uh and
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
but they you know that might not be
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
their everyday uh choice for their their
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
look as I say so uh the estheticians and
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists are are are capable of of
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
changing a woman's style uh and and so
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
that what the work they produce uh is
 
02:14:01.870 --> 02:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily permanent is that
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
correct I don't I don't believe that's
 
02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
true uh representative I think if
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to bleach their hair or
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
turn it red it can take up to a year to
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
get that out so if somebody does use a
 
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
wrong color or young and I'm speaking as
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
a non-c cosmetologist however I do know
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
from from professional from personal um
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
things that I've done with my hair that
 
02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always go back right away so
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think that um those there are a lot of
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
things that they do that could cause
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
more permanent issu not semi-permanent
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
issues the same way meaning that it
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
would take a long time to turn that
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
around so if someone bleaches their hair
 
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
right out not always can you go back to
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
your original hair
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
color right away I'll leave it at that
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you there
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
being no more questions for M Rodriguez
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time uh
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
brri good morning I'm sorry uh my
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
computer had an issue for a second there
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
um so good morning members of the
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh I'm Tom rrick I'm legal
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
legal counsel at the office of
 
02:15:23.069 --> 02:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
professional lure and certification or
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
oplc so the oplc provides administrative
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
and clerical support recordkeeping
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
services and business processing for the
 
02:15:33.149 --> 02:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
54 licensing boards commissions and
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
councils under our
 
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
umbrella there's two oplc boards here
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this bill the Board
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
of barbering cosmetology and Aesthetics
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and the the body art Advisory Board I
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
want to make clear right now I'm
 
02:15:47.470 --> 02:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
speaking today on behalf of the oplc as
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
the agency only I'm not speaking on
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of either of those
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
boards um oplc is not taking a formal
 
02:15:57.870 --> 02:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I wanted to
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with some
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
background on the bill and the work the
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
agency has done to date um so first of
 
02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
all I was going to go through a bit on
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
what microblading is but you have heard
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
from individuals with far more expertise
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
than I so I'm going to skip that part um
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
but several years ago I believe in 2018
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and aestheticians sought
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide microblading to
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
their clients and were contacting the
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
board of Barber barbering cosmetology
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics about this the Board of
 
02:16:29.069 --> 02:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and Aesthetics
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
began working with the body at Art
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
advisory Council um or Advisory Board to
 
02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
come up with the language that would
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
work several legislators uh were very
 
02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
helpful with this process two of which
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
are on this committee um represented
 
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire and I believe repr
 
02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt was involved as
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
well though correct me if I'm wrong um
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and Schmidt along
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
with representative oxenham and two
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
senators sponsored an identical Bill
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
last legislative session hb1
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
1416 um it was unfortunately tabled in
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate as you've heard due to the
 
02:17:08.589 --> 02:17:08.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic but uh at that point um I
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
believe both boards were in favor of hb1
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
1416 last legislative session so knowing
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
that this was a priority for both boards
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
at the time um oplc had worked on behalf
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the boards this year to make sure
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill was
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
refiled and it had been uh opl's
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that both boards remained
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
in favor this bill to date although it
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
sounds like some of that has changed so
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned OPC is not taking a
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
position on the bill um I'll note that
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
if the concern is public protection the
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
bill was structured with Public Safety
 
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
in mind so any cosmetologist or
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
esthetician that wishes to perform
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
esthetician that wishes to perform
microblading

02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
microblading
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
under this bill they must first get a
 
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
microblading certificate from the body
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um the authorities being
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
given to the body art Advisory Board
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
through op's executive director to come
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
up with all the requirements to obtain
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
and renew the microblading certificate
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
um those requirements would be set via
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
rules including all the standards of
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
hygiene for microblading and I I this is
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
the um representative goalie you had you
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
had addressed this exact point earlier
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
so in so far as the body artart Advisory
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
Board is the entity that has the
 
02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
expertise on on the needling
 
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
hygiene that's the entity that will be
 
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
drafting these
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
rules to to one point of clarification
 
02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
the additional twist here is the the
 
02:18:35.549 --> 02:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
body art Advisory Board is an Advisory
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
board so um The rulemaking Authority L
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
does rest with the executive director of
 
02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:42.669 align:start position:0%
does rest with the executive director of
the

02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
oplc uh in practice what happens is the
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
the advisory boards under oplc are
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
drafting um a proposed role because they
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
are the experts and they send it to the
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
executive director for review and
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
approval which then starts the ru making
 
02:19:04.110 --> 02:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
process so the body art Advisory Board
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
will be heavily involved in the rul
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
making process on this um I think that
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
is all I have so thank you for your time
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to answer any questions
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
you may have any member of committee
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
brri representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good morning Mr bradrick uh
 
02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here this morning uh
 
02:19:33.790 --> 02:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
I have a question with regard to um out
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
ofate uh training and procedures and
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
certificates um I I have been given to
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
understand that there are some uh some
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
procedures or some trainings in other
 
02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
procedures or some trainings in other
states

02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh that seem to me to be questionable in
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
terms of their
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy um and can you speak to the uh
 
02:19:59.550 --> 02:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
because I know we have worked on this
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee at Great length with regard to
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
doing reciprocity with other states uh
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and this is something
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
that I would be concerned about because
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the issue of safety has certainly
 
02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
come up uh as a result of the testimony
 
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
of Mr wette and Miss Smith um and I'm
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
wondering uh can you speak to that issue
 
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
because to the degree that we might have
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
neighboring states which do not have uh
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
processes which we would find acceptable
 
02:20:36.429 --> 02:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
uh but are producing
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
certificate um uh trained uh or provide
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
people with certificates let's put it
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
that way uh and Mike tried to come into
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and um and use their
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
certificates here can you talk to
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that sure um so I I think you're
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
touching on several different things
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
there uh the the first point would be
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
that anyone that comes into the state uh
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
to do microblading under this bill would
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
need to be either a a licensed tattoo or
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
licensed body artist under the body art
 
02:21:14.429 --> 02:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
board or under this exception um could
 
02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
be a cosmetologist or aesthetician with
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
this certificate issued by the New
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um by New Hampshire so
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't use their Massachusetts
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
license to just come in here and start
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
practicing um the requirements to get
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
that certificate are set by by rule here
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
and the body art uh board body art
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um can come up with
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
whatever however strict um requirements
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
they want for that it's under their
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
Authority um as far as reciprocity I I
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
would have to double check but I do not
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
believe the body art Advisory board has
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
a specific reciprocity statute there is
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
a general reciprocity statute I I think
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's in 332 chapter
 
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
332g um and I'm paraphrasing but I
 
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
believe it says that if a border
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
commission makes the determination that
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
um another State's license is is um
 
02:22:20.349 --> 02:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
substantially similar again I'm
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing to our licenser
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
requirements they can allow um lure from
 
02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
that other state
 
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
um I I under the hypothetically posed I
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
think the board could determine that um
 
02:22:39.309 --> 02:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
the other state is not substantially
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
similar and thus could would not be
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
required to issue a reciprocal
 
02:22:48.349 --> 02:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
license than that
 
02:22:51.550 --> 02:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mr
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Brer there being none thank you for your
 
02:22:58.349 --> 02:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Brer I do see uh two people
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the attendees list requesting to
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
speak they're not signed up to speak I'm
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
gonna allow it but it's going to be
 
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
short because we're on a time crunch
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
here so I'm going to
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%

ahead sure my name is Danielle Ricks um
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a licensed tattoo artist and I've
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
been um I own and operate the brow TI um
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
at of Key New Hampshire and I've been in
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
business since
 
02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
2017 and all I do is microblade eyebrows
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
and I also do a technique um called
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
powder brows which is a Cosmetic tattoo
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
technique that's done with the machine
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's basically the same as a tattoo
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
machine um I know you don't have a lot
 
02:26:02.389 --> 02:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
of time so I just wanted to go over a
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
couple key points um that maybe someone
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
didn't mention before but um when I did
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
my training um I actually did my
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
training in Connecticut um it was a
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
4-day microblading training um at the
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
end of that four days my company that I
 
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
trained with um gave me a series of
 
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
tests that I had to pass in order for me
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
to obtain my certification so after
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
taking the course it took me about four
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
months of practicing to be able to pass
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
their certification um and then on top
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
of that I had to um get my, 1500 hours
 
02:26:39.439 --> 02:26:41.710 align:start position:0%
of that I had to um get my, 1500 hours
of

02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:44.750 --> 02:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um before I did this um I
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
also was a makeup artist and
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to uh make a point
 
02:26:54.030 --> 02:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
that because of that background um and
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
also my husband is a licensed tattoo
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
artist he's been a tattoo artist in the
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
state for almost 20 years um in no way
 
02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
did those things make it easier for me
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
to perform microblading um I think a big
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
misconception is that it looks a lot
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
easier than it actually
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
is um but it's very technical um it took
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
me quite a while to feel comtable to be
 
02:27:20.269 --> 02:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
able to do this on people's faces um
 
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely blood involved um you
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
do have to know cross contamination and
 
02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
have the proper
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
setup um and I also wanted to make the
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
point that it is not semi-permanent
 
02:27:35.870 --> 02:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
despite the terms being used um it is
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
called semi-permanent in some cases just
 
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
because touch-ups are needed um over
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
time to keep the complete look up but
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's very possible that some pigment uh
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
enter into the skin will remain over
 
02:27:51.389 --> 02:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
time and it may never go away so those
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
are just a couple key points that I
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make um but if you have any
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions please let me know uh thank
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr vix could you tell me um if you
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
are for or against the bill I don't
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
think you've actually said
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
that yeah sorry about that no I'm
 
02:28:11.070 --> 02:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
actually against it um I am happy with
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
how the law stands currently um and I
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't think cosmetologists and
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
aestheticians um um necessarily have any
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
kind of Advantage um to doing this
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
technique other than maybe you know
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
knowing about cross contamination or
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
sanitation procedures but um I
 
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
apprenticed with my husband who doesn't
 
02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
do tattoos on faces he does you know
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
like regular arms and legs but doing an
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship with him was actually
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
very beneficial because I learned about
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination and bloodborne
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
pathogens and color theory so while it
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
was an eyebrow specific
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
with him there's many things that I
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
learned um and I feel like a tattoo
 
02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship of some kind is
 
02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:56.110 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship of some kind is
absolutely

02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
necessary great thank you I I appreciate

you've made the right decision because
 
02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
even though I could hear the Young
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat the volume was not sufficient
 
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
for the committee to be able to make use
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%

03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
system it seems a little garbled to me

myself

03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
sound um it's
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
not you know you're you're I can I can
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand you but it's I still don't
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's the system does not indicate that
 
03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:39.269 align:start position:0%
it's the system does not indicate that
you're

03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:43.870 --> 03:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
muted I I hav even joined in the
 
03:27:43.880 --> 03:27:46.309 align:start position:0%
muted I I hav even joined in the
audio

03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
audio
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.670 --> 03:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:05.309 --> 03:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
option it's funny representative Roy
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
because I I see you as muted but I can
 
03:28:10.510 --> 03:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
hear you it's the microphones in the
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
room that are that are picking up and
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
that's why the devices need to be muted
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
because it creates an an
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
issue is that
 
03:28:26.349 --> 03:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
better well no obviously
 
03:28:31.150 --> 03:28:31.160 align:start position:0%

now is the m your mouse are you speaking
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
near the microphone because I think this
 
03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
happened the last time when you were
 
03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
microphone into the microphone is that
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
better yes yes that's much that's better
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%

um increase the time frame with which we
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
meet our crude
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
liability and um it affects no uh
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
current employees they stay they remain
 
03:30:07.229 --> 03:30:07.239 align:start position:0%

employees after January 1st
 
03:30:25.630 --> 03:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
2022 um the only the only issue I have
 
03:30:28.269 --> 03:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
is and I'm not sure that it matters but
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the analysis it mentions uh after
 
03:30:34.990 --> 03:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2021 which should read
 
03:30:38.910 --> 03:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
2022 I'm sure Rec the analysis the bill
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
from last year right
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay and uh Mr flurry who's the
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
executive director retired uh Friday but
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
articulate uh the this these both bills
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
better uh I believe is also here and I
 
03:30:59.550 --> 03:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and any
 
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
questions I have one question and that's
 
03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
really why is this coming before the
 
03:31:08.910 --> 03:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
legislature if it's purely a city of
 
03:31:12.269 --> 03:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester issue we need to make sure
 
03:31:12.279 --> 03:31:13.150 align:start position:0%
Manchester issue we need to make sure
that

03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
your your retirement system is run
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
fairly and trustees
 
03:31:26.110 --> 03:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
involv yeah Mr flurry could address that
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it's tied into
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
the state and we need this approval to
 
03:31:33.680 --> 03:31:39.950 align:start position:0%
the state and we need this approval to

03:31:43.439 --> 03:31:47.510 align:start position:0%
it are there any other questions from
the

03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:50.830 --> 03:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
committee Madam chair I have my hand up

03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
you representative long for taking my
 
03:32:01.120 --> 03:32:02.670 align:start position:0%
you representative long for taking my
question

03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and this bill increases
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
rates for new
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
highes um um to pay the city's unfunded
 
03:32:15.269 --> 03:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
liability at this time do you think
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's prudent to be doing when I
 
03:32:19.630 --> 03:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
believe the city's having a tough enough
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
time filling some of the positions it
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
has to ask those that they are trying to
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
recruit to pay more so that they can pay
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
off uh some of the unfunded ACR
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
liability that the city itself is um
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
obtained well thank you representative
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
03:32:43.150 --> 03:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
and personal I don't again those
 
03:32:44.590 --> 03:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
employees that are currently in the
 
03:32:47.469 --> 03:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
system have no changes this would be for
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
new employees that would agree to the um
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
conditions set forth in this uh and
 
03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
frankly as a 24 year old getting into a
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
union I was looking for what goes in my
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
pocket I really didn't study the pension
 
03:33:06.070 --> 03:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
or other benefits um so I I don't I
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe this is going to deter
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
in looking for what's going into your
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
pocket when you're going to be getting
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
less going in because you're paying more
 
03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
towards a retirement cost for an
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability that you didn't have
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
any part
 
03:33:25.590 --> 03:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
in wouldn't that be part of the money
 
03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
going in your pocket seeing you're
 
03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
making that much less than those hired
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
before you yeah no I I I agree as
 
03:33:35.710 --> 03:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
um being a little more mature I would be
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that but at you know in my
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
20s and 30s what's going in my pocket I
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what's being taken out yet uh
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
for dues or whatever however you know I
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
look at what's going in my pocket so I
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
don't really believe that this my
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
understanding in in the determin from
 
03:33:59.229 --> 03:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
people being hired is the salary uh
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
which the city of Manchester
 
03:34:04.750 --> 03:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
addressed thank
 
03:34:08.070 --> 03:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
you um I have a a question it's as much
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
a comment as it is a question so you're
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
proposing that it's not hurtful because
 
03:34:15.790 --> 03:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at what's coming out
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
of their
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
paycheck is that
 
03:34:21.870 --> 03:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
satisfactory thank you for the question
 
03:34:25.389 --> 03:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative I I I don't believe that
 
03:34:27.870 --> 03:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe that somebody looking
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:34:33.070 --> 03:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
job knows exactly what to look for with
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
respect to benefits what they're paying
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
for benefits however I do know somebody
 
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
who accepts a job will accept these
 
03:34:43.189 --> 03:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
condition I conditions on their
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
pension followup please so in a time
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
when people are needing
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
jobs it sounds to me like the
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
proposition is that if we can take
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of them we will uh and I'm I'm
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
sorry uh but um that cuts right to the
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
chase of it in my
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
opinion well I I I I
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
you about 3 minutes early we got here
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
just on time I apologize if this has
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
been covered and I don't know who to
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
address it to but my question is is the
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester pension system completely
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
separate from the state one yes it is
 
03:35:27.469 --> 03:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you this applies to
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
theity of Manchester it does not apply
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
to police fire teachers who are in the
 
03:35:38.750 --> 03:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
no thank you just a quick question um
 
03:36:04.269 --> 03:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
does this have any collective bargaining
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
implication just got potential for Union
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
litigation can you speak to that
 
03:36:13.870 --> 03:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding Mr flurry would
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
have a more articulate answer but my
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you uh Madam chair and
 
03:36:53.950 --> 03:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
Jim Durkin legislative agent for ask me
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
Council 93 proudly representing 4,000
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
public sector workers in New Hampshire
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
including over 200 men and women working
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
in multiable departments for the city of
 
03:37:08.349 --> 03:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester and a wide array of jobs
 
03:37:10.750 --> 03:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
ranging from snowplow drivers to School
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
nurses and I'm here today on their
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
behalf and on behalf of those who will
 
03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
fill these jobs in the future to oppose
 
03:37:21.309 --> 03:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 211 uh for starters we oppose
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
the legislation because we fundamentally
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
disagree with any effort to unfairly
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
shift any additional amount of the
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
funding liability onto the backs of
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
hardworking public employees even those
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
who have yet to be hired we also oppose
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
increasing minimum age requirements
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
especially for workers that have stous
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
job responsibilities such as our public
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
sector workers you know just requiring
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
to work beyond the age already
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
established in current law is not only
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
unfair but it creates a higher
 
03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
likelihood of serious injury and from a
 
03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers point of view could subject
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
the municipality to costly workers comp
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
and other Financial liabilities for a
 
03:37:59.189 --> 03:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
city but what's really important for
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
this committee to know is the brief
 
03:38:03.150 --> 03:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
history behind this legislation it's a
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
refile from the previous session and
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
suffice to say things have changed
 
03:38:09.870 --> 03:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
significantly since then and while the
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
proposed changes may have had the
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
support of a majority of the city's
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board in the past composition
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
of this board has changed and the
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
proposed changes in this bill no longer
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh enjoy the support of at least three
 
03:38:24.990 --> 03:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the seven members of the current
 
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
board quite possibly more and this is
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
due in no small part to a recent report
 
03:38:32.070 --> 03:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
from the board's pension Consultants on
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
Friday I spoke personally with dick
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
Molen the chair of the Retirement Board
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
who informed me that their Consultants a
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
group called uh New England pension
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
Consultants informed the board just last
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
month that they're now on track to meet
 
03:38:46.469 --> 03:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
their required funding obligations
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
without making these proposed changes Mr
 
03:38:50.830 --> 03:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
Mullen told me he doesn't support the
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
changes and authorized me to relay that
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
to you today uh in addition over the
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
weekend I also spoke personally to two
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
other members of the Retirement Board uh
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
Matt session and Tom bazo both told me
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're opposed to making these changes
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
and like Mr Mullen both authorized me to
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
convey their opposition to you today so
 
03:39:10.429 --> 03:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's three of the seven members of the
 
03:39:12.910 --> 03:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
board right there in addition to not
 
03:39:14.510 --> 03:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
having The Firm support of the current
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board these proposed changes
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
have yet to be heard by and voted on by
 
03:39:21.429 --> 03:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
the Manchester City Board of Alderman
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
and it's fair to say there's
 
03:39:24.189 --> 03:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
questionable support on that board as
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
well in fact the alderman is slated to
 
03:39:28.269 --> 03:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the matter at their meeting
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night while the new Retirement
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
Board is slated to meet one week from
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to discuss these changes they
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
have not had an opportunity to meet yet
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
on it as stated at the onset of my
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
testimony we oppos the legislation on
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
its merits or lack thereof and we ask
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
that you support us in this opposition
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
however given the AFF forementioned
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
change and support at the Retirement
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
Board the positive report from the
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
board's experienced professional
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
consultants and the uncertainty of the
 
03:39:56.910 --> 03:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
pending action of the Alderman and the
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board we would respectfully
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
request that at the very least this
 
03:40:03.910 --> 03:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee re uh refrain from any further
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
action until at least such time as the
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board and Alderman have had a
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
chance to act Liber at on the matter
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
finally in closing I also spoke this
 
03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
morning with Manchester uh mayor Joyce
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
Craig who as an ex officio member of the
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board would cast a vote in
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
the event of a three to3 tie and she
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
said I could convey her request that you
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
delay action on this bill until the new
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board and Alderman have had a
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
chance to weigh in so uh I thank you for
 
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration I'll do my
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
best to answer any questions that
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee may have and
 
03:40:41.469 --> 03:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I wanted to be under three
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
minutes out of respect to the committee
 
03:40:45.309 --> 03:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
but if I could add one more thing based
 
03:40:47.309 --> 03:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
on what I heard prior to my
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
testimony uh thank you uh re uh rep
 
03:40:52.590 --> 03:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
goalie I believe mentioned uh the
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
problem of recruitment I can tell you
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
from talking to our members up there
 
03:40:59.670 --> 03:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
that recruitment is a problem and this
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
will exacerbate it uh they mentioned one
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
position in particular uh an
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
electrician's position that's been
 
03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
posted for several months and uh you
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
know you to be the the municipal jobs
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
may not have paid too much but the
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
benefit in getting there and sticking
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
there was the benefits and the
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
retirement and under this bill you're
 
03:41:23.950 --> 03:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
essentially you're asking them to pay
 
03:41:25.750 --> 03:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
almost double what the contribution
 
03:41:28.269 --> 03:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
rates were you're asking them to work
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
longer and you're basing the pension
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
benefit now on five years average
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
earning as opposed to three so by
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
reducing this benefit you are going to
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
you are going to uh create a recruitment
 
03:41:45.149 --> 03:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
problem uh but most importantly really
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know we would urge you to to to you
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
know this is a local bill as was pointed
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
out it's local changes the Alderman and
 
03:41:55.149 --> 03:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
the new Retirement Board and the new
 
03:41:57.149 --> 03:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
Alderman really should have a chance to
 
03:41:58.990 --> 03:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this and convey how they
 
03:42:00.750 --> 03:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
feel to this committee before the
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee acts thank you
 
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
again thank
 
03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
you did I hear you correctly to say that
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
the Manchester City retirement system
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
is is properly funded or on track to
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
being so that was relayed to me by uh uh
 
03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Mullen who's the chair of the board
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
and that was based on a Consultants
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
report uh that they received I believe
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
just last month and the group is called
 
03:42:34.030 --> 03:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
New England pension Consultants they're
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
a reputable organization they've been in
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
business for almost 35 years uh doing
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
this kind to
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
work thank you very much are there any
 
03:42:51.149 --> 03:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.750 --> 03:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you taking my
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
question um with regard to new hes I
 
03:43:03.550 --> 03:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
guess it's probably not a collective
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
bargain of issue but if they were to try
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
and increase it on current members of
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
the system would that then
 
03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:12.030 align:start position:0%
the system would that then
Collective

03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
Collective
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
produtions I I believe it would
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative not uh not my my area of
 
03:43:21.309 --> 03:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
work for the union I do not negotiate
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
contracts but it is something that we
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
would certainly uh you know certainly
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions being none
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
slurry

03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
might have to unmute
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm working on
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%

you thank you madam chairman uh for the
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%

03:44:59.469 --> 03:44:59.479 align:start position:0%
uh executive chairman emeritus of the
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the Manchester employees
 
03:45:04.189 --> 03:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
contributor retirement system I
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
technically retired last Friday uh a
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about my uh my background was
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
with the city at at Manchester
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
retirement for 17 years I was with the
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system for more
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
than 25 years prior to that and my uh my
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area is extensive I'm
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
hearing to speak in favor of the
 
03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and to perhaps address a few
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I've heard come up
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
in testimony uh prior to this uh one of
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
the questions is why is this before the
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
legislature uh Manchester is like every
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
other and my Public Employee Retirement
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
System uh has to be a qualified plan
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
according to section 401 A9 of the
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code section four 401
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
A9 says when you have a state or local
 
03:45:52.870 --> 03:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal plan and you're amending any
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the provisions of the plan it must be
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
be done through a state legislature
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester does not have the authority
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
to make these changes on their own so
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
really this is is the legislator one of
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
the questions is why is this perform a
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislature ability to empower
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester to make change
 
03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh I also heard has to
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
be99 says when you have a States was
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
fair the rate increases were going to be
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
fair to people are going to be hired
 
03:46:21.630 --> 03:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
prospectively I might point out that
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
these rates whether it be the fiveyear
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
averaging the contribuition amount are
 
03:46:28.990 --> 03:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the so really this is the legisl
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
of the same as the New Hampshire
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system is now so perhaps
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's a bit of catch up there uh the
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
plan was studied for a period of a
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
number must be of years through
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester power Manchester to make
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
changes our actuary G actuary Gabriel
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
Roden Smith and the trustees at the time
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
were very concerned right now for one
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
this was increase pce make additional 30
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
cents the board was concerned that if
 
03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
that number grew much larger that the
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
plan might not be sustainable so if the
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
concern is what's going to happen to
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
future people you plan was study happen
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
if that rate grew so high that like many
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
other public C pay an additional if that
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
number grew much larger that the plan
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
might not be sustained shut down a
 
03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
defined benefit and go to a defined
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
contribution that certainly would not be
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of your future
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
employees in fact it was the opinion of
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
the board up until the recent election
 
03:47:29.149 --> 03:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
that uh the retirement system really
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
helped to attract and retain perhaps
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
elction that places in the public sector
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
where you can still find a defined
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefit plan one that will pay you the
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
kind of benefit and R Trust at the time
 
03:47:42.670 --> 03:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
now for every dollar in wages the
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
changes were essentially to lower the
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
board was concerned that noral
 
03:47:49.950 --> 03:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
retirement 62 in the 17 years I was
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
there like many years I was there I can
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that there are a lot of people
 
03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
that worked right Beyond retire the
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
normal retirement age and they did so
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
for other reasons it's true that if you
 
03:48:02.990 --> 03:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
have people that are in very uh
 
03:48:06.269 --> 03:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
stressful uh that demanding positions
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
62 would be more difficult that was a a
 
03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
dilemma the board had to cope with and
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
it did consider
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
that the other thing is that essentially
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
to lower the normal retirement age City
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
underpaying the discount amount so that
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
they were getting better than a fair
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
deal this was brought to the attention
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
of the Retirement Board by its actuary
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that would seek
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
that that this bill would seek to do
 
03:48:38.349 --> 03:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's true that you have is to create to
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
to correct that fact to bring it back to
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
normal actuarials uh physically and U I
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
guess in in closing uh what this bill
 
03:48:49.630 --> 03:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
would do to the unfunded acrude
 
03:48:49.640 --> 03:48:51.710 align:start position:0%
would do to the unfunded acrude
liability

03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
would be to cause it to be paid off
 
03:48:59.189 --> 03:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
about a year ahead of time and if you
 
03:49:01.950 --> 03:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
look at how unfunded acrude liabilities
 
03:49:04.229 --> 03:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
work it's very discount amount very
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
similar to a home mortgage when you're
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
paying on at the beginning of the
 
03:49:09.389 --> 03:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
mortgage almost nothing goes to
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
principle and everything to interest and
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
acrude liability Works in a similar
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
fashion so that in what this would allow
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
you to do is accelerate the payment near
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
the end would see this bill essentially
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
save the city about $14 million over the
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
next uh decade or so the unfunded ACR
 
03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
liability is scheduled to be uh uh
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
retired in uh
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
2039 we scheduled to be uh similar build
 
03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
to this in the session last year which
 
03:49:44.429 --> 03:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
didn't reach completion because of the
 
03:49:44.439 --> 03:49:45.790 align:start position:0%
didn't reach completion because of the
co

03:49:45.790 --> 03:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
co
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
situation in the Edna committee there
 
03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
were amendments made to that bill so
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
that when the acred liability was
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
satisfi it's very satisfied that that
 
03:49:57.710 --> 03:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
cost revision would switch back uh the
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
board had no difficulty with those
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
provisions and they are Incorporated in
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the language in 20111 so uh again U
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for many many years
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
I believe that the board when it studied
 
03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
this and acted upon it acted in the in
 
03:50:16.110 --> 03:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the fund and the
 
03:50:18.670 --> 03:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
fund and the best interest of not only
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
existing workers but future workers uh
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
there was also a little bit of uh
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
confusion about a report that came
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
retired and similar came from with with
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the current situation it is true that
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're that we're on target for earnings
 
03:50:37.389 --> 03:50:37.399 align:start position:0%
assumptions that has nothing to do with
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
funding requirements it's an apples an
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
orange situation the fund is expected to
 
03:50:46.349 --> 03:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
make its uh its uh funding obligation
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
and meet its earnings expectations out
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the next 20 years so the board had
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
notion on that uh that is all again the
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee would want to place emphasis
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
one thing that is acted in the the best
 
03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances this would
 
03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
have gone to the board of marinal and
 
03:51:07.229 --> 03:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
earlier than this and we would have been
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
able to come to you with some something
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
where that had a log of the vot of the
 
03:51:17.070 --> 03:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
log of the V of the of the BMA has
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
fortunately the way the time for
 
03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
earnings assumption scheduled until
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night it would have been far
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
preferable if we had been able to do
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
that earlier and I could have come to
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
you today saying this is how the the
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
board uh of Mayor Alderman uh felt about
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
the issue this was their vote
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately again those uh that
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
schedule is Revol funding obligation a
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
measure of Correction but uh again in
 
03:51:43.229 --> 03:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
closing I was asked to speak on behalf
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh if you have any other
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to answer them
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you earlier than this had a log of
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
the vote of the the BMA scheduled until
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night saying this is how the
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions members of
 
03:52:03.319 --> 03:52:06.429 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions members of
the

03:52:06.429 --> 03:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:06.439 --> 03:52:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
committee

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:52:12.070 --> 03:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you madam
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh Mr flurry you gave me your
 
03:52:19.710 --> 03:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
testimony uh you re decided is it a
 
03:52:22.830 --> 03:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
federal statute or a state the 401 could
 
03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
you give me that and is it state or
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
federal so I could do the research on
 
03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:29.189 align:start position:0%
federal so I could do the research on
that

03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:34.149 --> 03:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
please yes certainly uh that's section
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
4189 of the Internal Revenue
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
code and in order order for any public
 
03:52:43.590 --> 03:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh fund or Municipal Fund in any of the
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
50 states to meet the standards of being
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
a qualified plan and this in essence
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
that means that the the income the
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
income tax is exempt for the pension
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
fund on any of their investment earnings
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
you have to be a qualified plan and if
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
you are and you want to amend any of the
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
language to creates that plan it must
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
grow through the legislature in one of
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
the 50
 
03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:09.469 align:start position:0%
the 50
states

03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:53:14.110 --> 03:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
okay follow up if I may mam thank you um
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
I know you're not tied or any
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
affiliation with the NRS system but the
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh nhrs system does have a two-tier
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
similar to what you want to put or is
 
03:53:28.590 --> 03:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
recommended in this particular bill that
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
means and as you go on into the future
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
as older workers drop off and the
 
03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
younger ones you come down to the older
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
workers will be smaller in number and
 
03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
they'll be paying less and already
 
03:53:44.590 --> 03:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's that push back that we see in
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
the nhrs system uh because the younger
 
03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
members coming in are under a a
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
different thing do you anticipate that
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
same potential animosity uh in
 
03:53:58.510 --> 03:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester because of
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
this the board considered that and
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
that's why the language was crafted such
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
that it would only affect people not yet
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
working for the for the city we thought
 
03:54:13.630 --> 03:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
that there would be a certain degree of
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
push back from existing members if the
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
plan were made effective for everyone
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
immediately we had seen that happen when
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
the nhrs increased its its member
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
contribution uh rate and that was a
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
nasty situation that went as far as the
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
state supreme court we wanted to avoid
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
that and so the board thought that the
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
best way to do it would be to enact it
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
in such a way that no one who is
 
03:54:42.269 --> 03:54:42.279 align:start position:0%
currently in on the scene would be
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
adversely affected and then reflecting
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
on it further again as I State stated if
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
you can find any kind of an employer
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
offering a defined benefit plan for only
 
03:54:56.590 --> 03:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
a 5% contribution rate with the the the
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
balance being for a medical subsidy so
 
03:55:00.309 --> 03:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
the total contribution rate would be
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
seven and uh if you can find that
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh it's an
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
audity thank you for taking my questions
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%

questions thank you very
 
03:55:21.870 --> 03:55:21.880 align:start position:0%

03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%

Gerard flurry I the executive director
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
Meritus for the Manchester employees
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
contributory retirement system I'm here
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
today to testify in favor of House Bill
 
04:00:07.950 --> 04:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
356 is before the committee uh similar
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill was uh submitted last year under
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
HB 39 uh of 1293 made it as far as
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee with an ought to pass and then
 
04:00:20.110 --> 04:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
halted when the uh uh bill was U uh
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
tabled because of the covid situation uh
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
HB uh 356 is purely administrative in
 
04:00:29.910 --> 04:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
nature uh one of the situations that has
 
04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh troubled the uh the Board of
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
Trustees in recent years at city of
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester is that if uh if a trustee
 
04:00:38.670 --> 04:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
for any reason is unable to to finish
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
their elected term that they're short of
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
holding a special election there were uh
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
there was no provision to be able to
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
fill that Gap uh generally it's a small
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
board a lot of important decisions were
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
made are made and it seemed uh uh normal
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
that there ought to be some form of uh
 
04:00:59.389 --> 04:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
Authority where whereby the trustees
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
could appoint an individual to fill a
 
04:01:03.990 --> 04:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy until the next regularly
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled election that's common
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
practice in the number of cities and
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
towns other organizations throughout New
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so uh in order to be able to
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
do that a statutory Amendment to the
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
plan was required and this bill would
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
would accomplish that uh the other thing
 
04:01:22.189 --> 04:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill does is to help with
 
04:01:24.750 --> 04:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
compliance and ease compliance with uh
 
04:01:27.630 --> 04:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements uh any
 
04:01:30.510 --> 04:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
time that the uh that the federal
 
04:01:34.510 --> 04:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
authorities uh engage in revised rules
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
or regulations dealing with public plans
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
it's normally required that uh plans
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
come before their local legislatures to
 
04:01:47.110 --> 04:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
seek compliance sometimes those are very
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh minor matters could be the order in
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
which things are filed and or the like
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh in getting a uh a private letter
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
ruling uh in
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
2017 uh we were able to negotiate with
 
04:02:06.990 --> 04:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
the IRS and they agreed that rather than
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to come before the legislature for
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
minor housekeeping items that we could
 
04:02:15.870 --> 04:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
do it through Ru making within the city
 
04:02:18.110 --> 04:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
and whenever something like that would
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
happen uh a rule change would be posted
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
for 30 days there would be a public
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on it and then the board could
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
act to amend uh the the tax reporting
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
aspects of the plan in order to stay in
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
full compliance with the IRS but again
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to do that we need
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
needed an item of uh empowerment from
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
the state legislature that would allow
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
us to introduce future items strictly
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
related to uh federal tax law so that it
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
could be handled locally through rul
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
making and that's what this bill would
 
04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
do so again uh I would uh greatly
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate support of the committee on

04:03:26.800 --> 04:03:30.149 align:start position:0%
you said till the next election are your
trustees

04:03:30.149 --> 04:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
elected uh the board is a composite uh
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
there are two individuals the uh the
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
mayor and the City Finance director that
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
are ex official members of the board
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
then the uh the mayor gets to appoint a
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
trustee the alderman get to appoint a
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
trustee and there are three elected two
 
04:03:51.070 --> 04:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
of the elected members are members of
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
the system that is to say current
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
employees of the of the city and one of
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
them is simply needs to be a resident of
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
the city so of those three elected
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
positions within the last few years we
 
04:04:06.750 --> 04:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
had an individual that uh had to retire
 
04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
on a work-related ability and could not
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
finish their term and then we had
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
another individual that had uh a slate
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
of personal problems and had to resigned
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
from the board the board was powerless
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
to fill those positions uh short of
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.389 --> 04:04:37.399 align:start position:0%

I this is as I understand this is the
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
5% uh no I don't this is the one
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
where actually I have the wrong bill I
 
04:07:01.149 --> 04:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
would I'm sorry I'd like to withdraw
 
04:07:04.750 --> 04:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
that it was I wanted to do it on uh the
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
one related to extending the uh
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 390 yeah sorry about that I'd
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
like to make an itail motion on House
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 390
 
04:07:19.149 --> 04:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
oh right sorry for the confusion
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
representative leus actually meant House
 
04:07:21.319 --> 04:07:23.269 align:start position:0%
representative leus actually meant House
Bill

04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
390 which is to stretch out the unfunded
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
liability is there a second to that I
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
think it
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
was I'm sorry I had the same number
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
problem that representative le le had
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
fine do you seconded motion anyway yes I
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
do Madam chair okay thank you
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative leus would you care to
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion I would
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
um I mean the downside for this is that
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
it uh it's going to cost the taxpayers
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
an extra 1.4 billion over time it's uh
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard it's going to cost
 
04:08:05.149 --> 04:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
$2 for every uh dollar that's deferred
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
in the short term and the issue is
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's almost always um Financial
 
04:08:13.149 --> 04:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
pressures I mean that's sort of the
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
nature both of uh people's personal
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
budgets and certainly those of
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
government as well pressure for more
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
services and people don't want their
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
taxes raised so there's always going to
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
be temptation to do this but it's you
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
know in the same sense as people uh
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
putting everything on the credit card
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
bill you just uh you end up paying
 
04:08:33.830 --> 04:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically more in the long run and
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
just push out the time in which you Mo
 
04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
up you know you're actually have fullly
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
funded and when this is fully paid off
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
the current schedule is
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
2039 the amount the employers of the
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities County and the state will
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
have to pay that the uh retirement
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
system will will decrease
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
substantially and um you know arguably
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
30 years was uh was kind of long um as
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was given that a uh you know private
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Pension Plan would
 
04:09:07.630 --> 04:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh be allowed no more than seven years
 
04:09:07.640 --> 04:09:08.510 align:start position:0%
uh be allowed no more than seven years
do

04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
that I mean we heard the argument that
 
04:09:15.309 --> 04:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh in a sense that a uh public Pension
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
Plan can't go broke I'm not sure that's
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to turn out to be true there's
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
some states that are looking like they
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
may get into trouble that way but even
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
if it were true um it's still charging
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
you know making taxpayers pay a lot more
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
and the worst part of that is that that
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
money is going to come from people in
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
the future we're already talking um 19
 
04:09:40.109 --> 04:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
years out I mean so you're going to have
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
people who are children now or you know
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
potentially a small number who are not
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
yet born um who are going to be uh stuck
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
paying this money because we don't want
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
to um you know make up for past mistakes
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
now so I'd argue we you know it's not
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
right to be pushing this further out
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative BR would you
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
second it sets an unwarranted precedence
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
and it is an unwise use of the taxpayers
 
04:10:11.950 --> 04:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
dollars thank
 
04:10:14.910 --> 04:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else wish to speak
 
04:10:14.920 --> 04:10:18.910 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else wish to speak
represent

04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
s I'm not sure this is worth it but let
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
me say it briefly I was here in the 90s
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
when I saw some of this Mischief
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
unfolding and it hurt like it hurt to
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
see it then and it hurts to see it now
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
because the pain of nasua is real but
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
the medicine medine will be worse than
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
the disease so this is just this is just
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
around does anyone else wish to speak on
 
04:10:54.990 --> 04:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
390 yes Madam chair I don't think you
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I just want to
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%

04:11:16.590 --> 04:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
mayor of nashille is facing and I know
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
you also serve as a council member in
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
Alderman and I think that um finding
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
ways to reduce the burdens being
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
downshifted to the cities and towns is a
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
high priority for many of us if not all
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
of us I hope um and the property
 
04:11:40.590 --> 04:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
taxes in most towns and cities uh is
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
horrible and I hope that he doesn't take
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
this as a sign that we aren't committed
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
to tackling that with his help and I
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
believe um we really do need to find
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
better Solutions but I'm fortunately
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
gonna oppose this bill because this is
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
just not the right way in my
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you is there anyone else

the city of

pass second by
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
Smit thank you I believe we had a motion
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
already we just we sorry I didn't hear
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
that I understand it
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:43.229 --> 04:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
and I actually don't think we had
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
discussion but we did not have a motion
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
so the motion is from representative
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
Schulz is ought to pass second by
 
04:16:51.159 --> 04:16:53.429 align:start position:0%
Schulz is ought to pass second by
representative

04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt okay representative Schultz if
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to your motion yes
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
ma'am um this had uh almost by uh
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent uh before covid it was
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh 15 to4 it passed in the house before
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
on a Bo vote and this is one of those
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh but for covid it would have um
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
succeeded so um I hope that you will
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill it uh is an
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing that we need it at all
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that these Public Works
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
employees at the town and state level
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
are First Responders and have very risky
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous jobs and I think this is the
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
right thing to
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
do thank you Schmid do you wish to speak
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
to your second thank you I do Madam
 
04:17:54.189 --> 04:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
chair briefly this is a situation these
 
04:17:58.429 --> 04:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
people are at enormous risk darting in
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
out of traffic with regard to U their
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
jobs it's a miracle that we don't have
 
04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
more injuries and
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
fatalities um but maybe they just
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
learned to uh Dodge Dodge bullets so um
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
let's protect them as rare as it is
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
let's protect them when it
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
happens thank you is there anyone else
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
who would like representative please uh
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman chairwoman we
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
haven't even discussed okay you want to
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
be a chair all right you got it um I sat
 
04:18:33.630 --> 04:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
on the original subcommittee last time
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Shu and
 
04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
one other I think it may have been
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Fox I can't remember but
 
04:18:42.630 --> 04:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh in this is this is bringing back
 
04:18:44.429 --> 04:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
language from that subcommittee work
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
last time um I've you know I've worked
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
with uh with the Department of
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation and other folks on the
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
highway for over 20 years in my fire
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
service career and I am going to be
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill it's a rare event
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
it certainly is financially devastating
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
to the families they would certainly
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
much rather have their loved
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
one on top of the the loss of the
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
paycheck and all that so I I think this

House Bill 70 by representative grota
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
second you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:22:52.349 --> 04:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bara I'll second that
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we heard last year
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and went through this committee with no
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
issue and I don't see an issue
 
04:23:02.309 --> 04:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
again I see I think it's fine the way it
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
04:23:07.469 --> 04:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you in response to my second
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that the concerns raised
 
04:23:14.070 --> 04:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
by the tattoo artist should largely be
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
resolved by the fact this bill gives
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
them full authority to set the standards
 
04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
training because we don't know enough
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
about what's required to set what they
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
ought to be but they do and that's all I
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
say representative scitec thank you will
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
those uh will that training
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
is that a matter of rule will let go
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
before jail car yes the reason I'm
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
asking is uh I would not like to see the
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
rules made so
 
04:23:49.469 --> 04:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
prohibitive that it's basically a veto
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
andth to set that's what we will have to
 
04:23:59.950 --> 04:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
watch for the training representative
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
Pearson do you have a comment or
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
question what they to be I'm trying to
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
figure out why the television's on about
 
04:24:12.269 --> 04:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
represent representative Schultz are you
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
are you trying to speak will those no
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
ma'am uh will that
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
training is that a matter of
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
rule let go
 
04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
before yes yes exactly reason I'm ask is
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's history uh I would not
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
like to see the rules made step back in
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
time there are quite a few people that
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
it let's try
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
that okay is there anyone else who
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
speak I do we ask representative
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you so uh as much as I
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
would not like to have to have this
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
procedure done on me I'm not
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally opposed to the uh uh to
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the practice if it's done by somebody
 
04:25:10.349 --> 04:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
who knows what the hell they're doing uh
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
and so I think it behooves us I haven't
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
decided whether I'm going to vote no as
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
a protest against uh the not as a
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
warning against the possibility that uh
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the the rules will be too weak I I
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be prohibited either
 
04:25:30.070 --> 04:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
but this is not some weekend uh course
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh for somebody who's a A cosmotologist
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
or esthetician this is serious business
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
to be experiment not experiment but to
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
to be um operating on a woman's face or
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
a man's face for that matter uh with
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
something that's effectively going to be
 
04:25:52.030 --> 04:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
permanent so we have to it behooves us
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these rules really do
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh require the necessary training and it
 
04:25:58.710 --> 04:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
it it won't be
 
04:26:01.630 --> 04:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
brief yes thank you representative schm
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative leus um so is my
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
understanding correct that actually the
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
rules for tattooing are not set down in
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
statute but are actually generated by
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
the uh the board and it's the same board
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
that would be coming up with the rules
 
04:26:18.030 --> 04:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
for this microing you are correct the
 
04:26:20.429 --> 04:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
only requirement set in statute is the
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
only represent
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%

raised to me
 
04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh I have no longer have um looking at
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the requirements that will be done by uh
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations made by the body art
 
04:26:48.670 --> 04:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
board um along with the approval of the
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
courses and um any of the health issues
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%

recess to figure out why our why we're
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
getting this Echo the hearing for house
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%

pm. and for all those who made motions I
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%

they still need one they still need even
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
more so because what you need to do yeah
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
here but I have my audio turned off
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's just so I can see because I can't
 
04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
see that if you're if it's on consent
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
your goal is not only to convince people
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
to vote the way you want it's to
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:09.389 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
that mine tend to be relatively concise
 
04:31:22.159 --> 04:31:26.790 align:start position:0%

I

04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
beautifuler did it include
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:31:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
sort

04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow morning soon
 
04:32:01.389 --> 04:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
enough sometime tomorrow is a snow again
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
we don't don't absolutely need it for
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
no I'm not I'm not going to go longer
 
04:32:12.870 --> 04:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
how they're I've heard rumors that maybe
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
it'll be sort of like the hockey
 
04:32:28.870 --> 04:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
actually

04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.359 --> 04:33:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
better

04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:34:04.269 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.279 --> 04:34:22.109 align:start position:0%
 
El

04:34:22.109 --> 04:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
people I think that just getting that
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
forward helps with the because
 
04:34:29.719 --> 04:34:32.189 align:start position:0%
forward helps with the because
these

04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:34:32.199 --> 04:34:34.269 align:start position:0%
these
things

04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:35.869 align:start position:0%
things
and

04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
that the issue I have is I can normally
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
hear pretty well but if there's
 
04:34:48.109 --> 04:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
background noise it's more difficult so
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
this has been that helped a little bit
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you um but it's
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
people so the the reason the chairs
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
might didn't
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
might didn't
work

04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
on you want there's time later we could
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay his his testimony convinced me go
 
04:35:58.160 --> 04:36:00.109 align:start position:0%
okay his his testimony convinced me go
his

04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
way but the second
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:34.070 align:start position:0%
way but the second
Manch

04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
like

04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
one the one about someone leaving office
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
and their ability to oh
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
to and and to be able to accommodate
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
their the room set up yes if it's
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
possible would it be easier to help with
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
both viewing the screen and so with
 
04:37:08.429 --> 04:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
audio since as long as there only five
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
or six or seven
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
of move it up and then when the room
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
fills up we got to go back there with it
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%

in a subcommittee last session and was
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
ready to pass into law when covid-19 had
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
its way with it uh I'm representative
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
McGee of Hillsboro 27 Hollis and I'm the
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill which has a
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
twin bill on the Senate side this time
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
around sponsored by Senator Kevin avard
 
04:47:52.830 --> 04:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
so um he and I have discussed the bill
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh and support for this legislation um
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
however he was too late to sign on to my
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm actually on his bill and I
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
would like you to consider this bill to
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
be a bipartisan effort U because of that
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative McGee yes did
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
you say there's an identical bill in the

04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative avart also filed uh
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
similar language
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%

who can provide testimony uh relative to
 
04:48:27.030 --> 04:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
both music therapy as a profession and
 
04:48:29.470 --> 04:48:29.480 align:start position:0%

04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
family actually had an 18-year-old
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
member who broke his neck diving into a
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%

04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
going through a serious rehabilitation
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
in Spalding uh music therapy was the
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
preferred modality that they said they
 
04:50:27.150 --> 04:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
had seen improvements in people with
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
spinal cord injury so I just wanted to
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
say that because I have my own personal
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
experience now um RSA 328 F uh governing
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
Allied Health Professions would be
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
modified by this bill to include
 
04:50:41.830 --> 04:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
licensed music
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
therapists um in accordance with the
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
language that was modified by members of
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
this house committee so the bill that
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
you have before you has the modified
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
language of the most recent
 
04:50:55.628 --> 04:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh first and foro foremost
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is the aim is to recognize this
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
well established profession in the state
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for the therapeutic
 
04:51:04.590 --> 04:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
benefits it provides and to allow Health
 
04:51:06.390 --> 04:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
Providers to include this form of
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
therapy in their Allied Health
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
Professions list for the purpose of
 
04:51:10.000 --> 04:51:11.150 align:start position:0%
Professions list for the purpose of
insurance

04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement in the last session when I
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
learned about the objections of the
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
chair to the idea of adding another
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
qualified form of therapy uh to approved
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance systems lists um I really
 
04:51:25.390 --> 04:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to respond to that
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
concern in any meaningful way because I
 
04:51:29.548 --> 04:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
think she was concerned that insurance
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
rates would go up by adding this
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
additional modality
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
um however it appears that having the
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
option of a particular modality in
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
addition to what is already in that list
 
04:51:42.990 --> 04:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that a patient will use
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
more services it merely means that they
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
will have the freedom to choose the
 
04:51:50.190 --> 04:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate modality for what it is they
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
have as a condition for their particular
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
condition so in this way music therapy
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
has been proven to work in cases where
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
other therapies do not and these results
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
are scientifically based it's not merely
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
someone playing a guitar or recording
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
music without goal setting and a
 
04:52:07.390 --> 04:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
purposeful expertise behind it it is
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
supporting a trained therapist in
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
defining a treatment plan that leverages
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
the power of music to meet patients
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
where they are to achieve specific goals
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
against stubborn impediments the fiscal
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
note mentions the cost associated with
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
having to add a person who administers
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
this program for the state there would
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
be an offset to that cost based on the
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
existing and future lure fees collected
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
every two years that would contribute to
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of music therapy LIC Ure
 
04:52:37.948 --> 04:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
Administration I believe an objective um
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
to to this
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
salary uh should be met with the
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that the other salaries
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
now paid for other Allied Health
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
Professions are no more worthy than
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
music therapy if you have any questions
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
for me I'm happy to answer them
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would be happy to pass the
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
Baton to licensed music therapist

some trouble finding it which is why I
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
was a little equivocal about whether
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%

the oplc to give us some administrative
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%

I just had a little glitch with the
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
internet good afternoon Madam chair and
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Tina Kelly
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
from the office of professional lure and
 
04:54:10.240 --> 04:54:12.230 align:start position:0%
from the office of professional lure and
certification

04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
oplc um the office of professional liur
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
and certification does not um support
 
04:54:20.548 --> 04:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
nor do they oppose this
 
04:54:23.470 --> 04:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
bill um but we are we do have one area
 
04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
of concern and which is
 
04:54:32.110 --> 04:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
unclear when looking at page three line
 
04:54:35.310 --> 04:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
14 it's states that the executive
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
director shall seek the advice of the
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
board for issues related to the
 
04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
regulation of music therapy now all of
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
the boards under Allied Health are
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
independent boards and are not advisory
 
04:54:50.910 --> 04:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
boards this um line is a little
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
confusing because we're not sure whether
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
it's a a independent board under Allied
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
Health or an Advisory Board to the
 
04:54:58.760 --> 04:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
Health or an Advisory Board to the
executive

04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
director um and the only other thing is
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
that um I want to reiterate that on page
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
four it we're asking for a
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
full-time um labor grade 15 and in order
 
04:55:18.510 --> 04:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
to um move forward with a another board
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
it would be imperative that we have um
 
04:55:23.628 --> 04:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
an individual to help with the licensing
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
the administration of the board and all
 
04:55:27.548 --> 04:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
of those types of um
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
duties with that said I'll take any
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you repres pres
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
chair you uh you gave me a great segue
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
here we on uh page four about the
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
program Assistant two
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
position with the anticipated number of
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
folks looking to become licensed music
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
therapists be sufficient enough to cause
 
04:55:58.750 --> 04:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
the workload in the office to require
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
another person or is this could this
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
realistically just be absorbed into the
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
current U folks that oplc is is
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
using um they're very good question and
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
um what I would say is that right now
 
04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
with the number of people and the number
 
04:56:19.230 --> 04:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
of lenses and the growth of those
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
lenses current staff at oplc is um
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
stretched actually to their limits so in
 
04:56:29.110 --> 04:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
adding another board and more license
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
types that's another um set of
 
04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
regulations it would be we would
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
position so I if I could paraphrase the
 
04:56:45.310 --> 04:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
person is not necessarily full-time in
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
order to support this particular board
 
04:56:50.110 --> 04:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
but to also support the ongoing
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
oplc well in a way yes but um with this
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
particular board there would be somebody
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
would have to administer the board and
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
the way oplc is
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
restructuring they have a light a
 
04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
renewal section they have an initial
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
licensure section they have administr to
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
administer the boards so it the work of
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
boards is more spread out but even with
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
the addition of that it's going to put
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
more strain on the already overburdened
 
04:57:24.000 --> 04:57:26.628 align:start position:0%
more strain on the already overburdened
um

04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
staff thank you I follow follow up the
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
the the funds necessary to to establish
 
04:57:40.548 --> 04:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
this position are going to come solely
 
04:57:43.628 --> 04:57:43.638 align:start position:0%
from the licensing fees from the music
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
therapists or is this going to require
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
other licensing fees to go up a little
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
bit to to generate enough Revenue to
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
make this position
 
04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
happen Okay I I do not anticipate that
 
04:57:59.548 --> 04:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
that would happen what I anticipate is
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're still working out the fee
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
structure and how the fees are going to
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
be administered at
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
oplc but currently because they'd be
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
under Allied Health Allied Health shares
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
all those costs so um even though they
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bring in enough to cover
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
everything because of the way op um the
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
way Allied Health is structured all of
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
those fees go in together to um to be
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
utilized across those boards with that
 
04:58:34.110 --> 04:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
said oplc is changing that fee structure
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
so OPC determines the fees and um I
 
04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
would have to get get you information
 
04:58:43.510 --> 04:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
from Lindsay Courtney on how exactly
 
04:58:46.990 --> 04:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
that new structure is going to
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
look thank you representative Alo hi um
 
04:58:54.030 --> 04:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question U I
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
have a question about one sentence in
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
the language but actually uh I just want
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
to go back and clarify the answer to the
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
last question was that a yes or a no
 
04:59:08.350 --> 04:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
on which question sorry on on where the
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
resources are coming to pay uh for the
 
04:59:11.760 --> 04:59:12.948 align:start position:0%
resources are coming to pay uh for the
um

04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
employee I'm not sure if that was a yes
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
or no I would not anticipate that fees
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
would be raised okay and and now if I
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
may get to the question that started me
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
um there's a sentence that reads the
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill prohibits the practice of music
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
therapy without a license but there is
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
no penalty and it's it's an interesting
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
sentence be it it um causes me a little
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
bit of concern from two sides of the
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
coin to opposite
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
directions uh one is that there's no
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
penalty so if someone is breaking this
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
law why should there be no penalty and
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
the other side of that really same
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
question is is this going to Bar the way
 
05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
for uh an approach to well-being that
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
right now is accessible to every one uh
 
05:00:05.190 --> 05:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
and their
 
05:00:07.868 --> 05:00:07.878 align:start position:0%
acquaintances by making it necessary to
 
05:00:12.750 --> 05:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
go to a board certified individual to um
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
to enjoy the
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
advantages to benefit from the
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
advantages of involvement in music could
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
I answer that I think that yeah someone
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
else other than Miss Kelly would be best
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
to answer that thank you yes please do
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
answer I I believe that in the last
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
session this question came up as well
 
05:00:34.350 --> 05:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
that people were concerned that folks
 
05:00:37.708 --> 05:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
who use music as a way to do all kinds
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
of good things would be in some way
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited because of the
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that if someone is
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
purporting to be a licensed you know or
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
certified music therapist that they
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually have to be certified and I
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
think they're they're pretty much
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive we're not talking
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
about somebody who knows how to play
 
05:00:58.990 --> 05:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
guitar coming in like or Senator avard
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
coming in uh when the fourth graders
 
05:01:03.030 --> 05:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
come up to Representatives Hall and play
 
05:01:06.990 --> 05:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
guitar for them um it's they they're not
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're not the same thing music therapy
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
is a very particular uh modality of
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
therapy and so um I I don't I don't
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
think those two things would ever cross
 
05:01:21.548 --> 05:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
no one who is a b a board certified
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
therapist would ever be concerned that
 
05:01:26.670 --> 05:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
somebody was using music it's if someone
 
05:01:30.510 --> 05:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
is um if someone is representing
 
05:01:32.190 --> 05:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
themselves as someone who has the
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
training credentialing and expertise
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they do not have that they would be
 
05:01:37.590 --> 05:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
concerned and I think that's why they
 
05:01:40.030 --> 05:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
want the profession recognized for the
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
skills that it brings that are separate
 
05:01:43.868 --> 05:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
from just someone who's a musician thank
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Lego you want follow
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
up yeah a follow on to that I'm I'm not
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the um example that you
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
use either um I know that the police
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be kicking down the door
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
for someone playing the guitar but
 
05:01:59.670 --> 05:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of gray area I'm concerned
 
05:02:05.310 --> 05:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
about um uh person who needs a uh a
 
05:02:08.670 --> 05:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
release a relief a diversion uh and an
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
acquaintance or a professional
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
acquaintance says uh pick up the
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
guitar uh I just think that there's gray
 
05:02:20.548 --> 05:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
area in there that worries me some can
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
you speak to the the gray area a little
 
05:02:26.430 --> 05:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
bit yeah I think I think you know I
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
think this most significant aspect of
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
this bill which is relevant to other
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
states that have already adopted this is
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
the ability for this modality of therapy
 
05:02:40.548 --> 05:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
to be acknowledged as included under
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
insurance so that folks who are
 
05:02:44.430 --> 05:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
professionally trained who can give
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
people relief under this form of therapy
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
are actually able to get paid somebody
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have that certification uh
 
05:02:53.788 --> 05:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
and is not acknowledged as a as a
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
licensed and certified therapist would
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
not be able to qualify for that payment
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think there are probably
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
other people on the call who have more
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
familiarity with it because I'm not I'm
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
not in the profession um I learned about
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
it in the last time around and because
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
my constituent who asked me to put the
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill in is a licensed music therapist
 
05:03:17.548 --> 05:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
and she's one of the people who's going
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
to be testifying today I think that
 
05:03:22.510 --> 05:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
other people should should mention this
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
when they're testifying that would be
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
the easiest thank you for that thank you
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
other are there other questions from
 
05:03:30.000 --> 05:03:31.310 align:start position:0%
other are there other questions from

05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire I would
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
like to highlight two important points
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
on the necessity of this bill first
 
05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
increasing access to services and
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
protecting consumers from harm is the
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
second people seek music therapy for
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
many reasons reasons I've helped a child
 
05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
with cerebral paly learn to feed himself
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
and also through the combination of a
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic relationship and songwriting
 
05:04:44.910 --> 05:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
I've helped a teen with depression cease
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
and prevent himself from continuing acts
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
of self harm but many people face
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic barriers preventing access
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
to music therapy
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
services you see private insurance
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
companies require the provider's license
 
05:05:01.110 --> 05:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
number on the credentialing form for
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and as hundreds of calls
 
05:05:05.230 --> 05:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
I've been told repeatedly that we can't
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
bypass this request for a license number
 
05:05:10.350 --> 05:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has the same requirement and
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
with over 27,000 disabled individuals
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled who can't access services from
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
unlicensed providers and that number
 
05:05:19.990 --> 05:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include abused and
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
traumatized children placed in foster
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
care yet referrals from licensed doctors
 
05:05:26.990 --> 05:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
and social workers who know the efficacy
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
of music therapy continue to come in for
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
patients in need who can't access our
 
05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
services I'm not asking you to Advocate
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
on our behalf to private or state
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
insurances or even get involved in the
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement process insurance
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is not the intent of this
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislation but it is imperative that
 
05:05:47.390 --> 05:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know the barriers that New Hampshire
 
05:05:47.400 --> 05:05:48.510 align:start position:0%
you know the barriers that New Hampshire
consumers

05:05:48.510 --> 05:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
face to my second point it might seem
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
hard to understand how music could cause
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
harm but I will explain music therapists
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
are explicitly trained to observe and
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
respond to a person 's responses to
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
music we continuously assess responses
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
and adapt our approach in the moment to
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
refrain from contraindicated practices
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
given the diversity of diagnoses we work
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
with Comprehensive and rigorous clinical
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
training and experience are necessary
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
and anyone attempting to provide music
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
therapy without the training and
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
credentials May pose serious risks to
 
05:06:30.270 --> 05:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
consumers an example of this harm is
 
05:06:32.548 --> 05:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
using music that's too complex for the
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
person's neurological system resulting
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
in agitation disregulation and even
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
possible seizure there's also the
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
potential of music to be triggering for
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
clients who've experienced trauma and
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
disorienting for clients with
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's ineffective or lack of
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
trained therapist response can lead to
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
short and long-term psychological or
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
even physiological harm and in New
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have individuals claiming
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
they provide music therap therapy to
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
these vulnerable populations yet they're
 
05:07:07.948 --> 05:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
not educated clinically trained or
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
board-certified and no one regulates
 
05:07:12.670 --> 05:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
their compliance with safety standards
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
that board music therapists are required
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
to comply with creating a state license
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
mandates individuals meet both state and
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
National standards when identifying
 
05:07:25.390 --> 05:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
themselves as a music therapist to
 
05:07:27.628 --> 05:07:27.638 align:start position:0%
Consumers and protects your most
 
05:07:30.390 --> 05:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens so I urge you to
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
vote Yes for New Hampshire house Bel 209
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
and increase access to the medically
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
necessary evidence-based services that
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
music therapists provide and protect
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
your constituents from the potential of
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
harm that could be caused by untrained
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
support thank you are there questions
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
for the from the committee yes
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you madam
 
05:07:54.638 --> 05:07:55.788 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you madam
chair

05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:07:58.110 --> 05:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Scott for taking my
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
question I've been in EMT in New
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 20 years I got a a simple
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
question in regards to your statement
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
involving um adverse
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
reaction to to what level does a
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
certified music therapists intervene
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
medically in the event of a not a
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
psychological trauma but actually more
 
05:08:18.350 --> 05:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
of a
 
05:08:21.510 --> 05:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
physical reaction to to something that
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
occurs uh Beyond just activating the EMS
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
system uh I mean depending on the event
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
we would call
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
up okay so so if I'm understanding you
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
correctly then this is this is your ex
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
the extent of this of this training
 
05:08:52.990 --> 05:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
would be to Simply recognize that
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
something bad is happening and that the
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
person needs to call
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
911 is it is it simply that is it really
 
05:09:03.628 --> 05:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
that simple no the extent would be that
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
we recognize when music is causing harm
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
when music is disrupting a person's
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
neurological system and that we need to
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
immediately Stop the Music Experience to
 
05:09:15.868 --> 05:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
further prevent that person from
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
becoming disregulated disoriented or
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
reaching a point where they may
 
05:09:20.798 --> 05:09:23.948 align:start position:0%
reaching a point where they may
experience

05:09:23.948 --> 05:09:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.958 --> 05:09:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
seizure

05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
05:09:25.600 --> 05:09:27.510 align:start position:0%
seizure
um

05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes thank you thank you
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if if you can
 
05:09:47.350 --> 05:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
can you give us um a ballpark of of what
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
a session music therapy session might
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
cost a consumer currently out of
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
pocket sure um roughly about 80 to $100
 
05:10:03.270 --> 05:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
per session for one hour session okay
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions yeah thank
 
05:10:11.670 --> 05:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
you if you don't mind me picking that
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on what represented Roy
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
just asked that current cost that you
 
05:10:16.750 --> 05:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the $80 $100 an hour
 
05:10:19.868 --> 05:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
that's a cash deal or is that what is
 
05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
build to insurance companies uh in
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
states that that do
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
license that would be
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
cash okay so the fee structure for
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers would be different no
 
05:10:37.548 --> 05:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
it would be the
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
same excuse me Madame chair this
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
is yes um how much is it please can can
 
05:10:48.510 --> 05:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh can you repay it for me
 
05:10:51.548 --> 05:10:51.558 align:start position:0%
please yes the average would be in for
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
New England for New England music
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
therapists would be between 80 and $100
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
per session okay all right so thank you
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
very much uh I have a second question
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
Madame chair
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
you yes uh what type of instrument that
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
person have to choose an instrument or
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
you going
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
to uh give that person an instrument to
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
play well music therapy is a very active
 
05:11:21.548 --> 05:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
music process um so both the client and
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
the therapist are making music um
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
clients of Music therapists don't need
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
any instrument background or um there's
 
05:11:32.670 --> 05:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
no specific instrument that we would
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
always use it's really client preference
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
um it's based on client need the music
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
therapist assesses what the goal for
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
that person is whether it's a motor
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
skill or whether it's working on um self
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
expression or um social emotional skills
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%

instrument and what kind of music and

of those elements of Music are decided
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
by the music therapist and they're based
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
on the client's need so it's dependent
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%

that is comprehensive and accessible to
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%

therapy license in New Hampshire and if
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
I have a moment I would love to Circle
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
back to a question that was asked
 
05:16:36.910 --> 05:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
earlier um about the difference between
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
music therapy and someone using music
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
so yes please do answer that question
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
sure music therapists do not do not own
 
05:16:53.788 --> 05:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
music we do not own the therapeutic uses
 
05:16:57.750 --> 05:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
of Music there are plenty of counselors
 
05:17:00.750 --> 05:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
in healthcare there are plenty of um
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists and speech
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
therapists who utilize music in their
 
05:17:08.510 --> 05:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
sessions as a way to work toward their
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
specific goals as well we don't own the
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
use of music as a way to work toward
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic goals what we're asking with
 
05:17:19.948 --> 05:17:19.958 align:start position:0%
this lure is to clarify that someone
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
claiming to be a licensed music
 
05:17:25.230 --> 05:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
therapist or a B board-certified music
 
05:17:27.390 --> 05:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
therapist has the credentials that
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
they're claiming that they have
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
currently there are people in our state
 
05:17:33.788 --> 05:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
that say that they're providing music
 
05:17:36.070 --> 05:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
therapy services and they are not
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
licensed or they are not board certified
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
they also do not have the education or
 
05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
the training people like to use the word
 
05:17:45.590 --> 05:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
therapy or therapeutic really Loosely to
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
anything that feels good or has worked
 
05:17:47.200 --> 05:17:48.030 align:start position:0%
anything that feels good or has worked
for

05:17:48.030 --> 05:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
them and so a lot of people combine
 
05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
music therapy in a very um casual way to
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
say that they're using music
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutically for themselves again
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's not a bad thing I want everyone
 
05:18:04.430 --> 05:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
to access music and um experience
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
positive effects from it what we are um
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get across is that the
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
profession of music therapy is a is a an
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
established and protected profession and
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
that we're saying if you are claiming to
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
be a therapist a music therapist you
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%

05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
and the um clinical education that
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
supports what you're telling people
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:34.600 align:start position:0%

05:18:41.230 --> 05:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you um so when you
 
05:18:43.230 --> 05:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
say a board certified music therapist
 
05:18:44.670 --> 05:18:44.680 align:start position:0%
and they're being concerned that they
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
may claim to be a not be you tell me two
 
05:18:50.430 --> 05:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
things one is what's involved becoming
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
board certified what does that mean and
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
number two um if someone claims to be
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
board certified is their way a potential
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
customer could determine whether they
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
were in fact board certified
 
05:19:05.470 --> 05:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
so the to become board certified is um
 
05:19:07.750 --> 05:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
what I testified about that education at
 
05:19:12.670 --> 05:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
least a bachelor's degree a um a 1200
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
hour uh clinical supervised uh
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
clinically supervised internship and
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
then sitting for the national board
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
certified exam um and passing that board
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
then to maintain that board
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
certification 100 hours of uh continuing
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
ed every 5 years
 
05:19:35.470 --> 05:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
um and that is similar those standards
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
are similar to other professions in the
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
um uh in the Allied Health
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
Professions um and in order to so to
 
05:19:49.310 --> 05:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
claim that you are an mtbc music
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
therapist board certified you have to
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
have those um that background for a
 
05:19:56.788 --> 05:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
consumer to check so someone can call
 
05:19:58.510 --> 05:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
themselves a music therapist and not
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
disclose that they are board certified
 
05:20:01.868 --> 05:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
or not board certified
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh because we have no lure in our state
 
05:20:05.628 --> 05:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
or anything holding us back from that or
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
holding someone back from that um
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
a a consumer could find out if they're
 
05:20:15.390 --> 05:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh if the person claiming to be a music
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
therapist uh by going to the board
 
05:20:21.708 --> 05:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
certification uh website which is
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
cbmt dorg which is our certifi our
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
nationally accredited certification
 
05:20:31.470 --> 05:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
Agency on their website you will find a
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
list of every single board certified
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
music therapist and the state that they
 
05:20:35.280 --> 05:20:37.230 align:start position:0%
music therapist and the state that they
work

05:20:37.230 --> 05:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
in follow um given that it's not clear
 
05:20:41.440 --> 05:20:42.110 align:start position:0%
in follow um given that it's not clear
to

05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
me um you know why there would be a need
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
for licensing specific to New Hampshire
 
05:20:52.030 --> 05:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
um you know assuming unless unless you
 
05:20:53.868 --> 05:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
believe the board certification process
 
05:20:53.878 --> 05:20:54.868 align:start position:0%
believe the board certification process
is

05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
inadequate um it's not clear why that
 
05:20:59.788 --> 05:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an adequate way for someone
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
to determine if the person they're
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
considering hiring uh you know has had
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of training sure um so yes
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
that is one protection our board
 
05:21:13.110 --> 05:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
certification we do believe is adequate
 
05:21:16.030 --> 05:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
for the standards that we practice by
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for lure has is
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
three-fold being a governing body you
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
are asserting that these professionals
 
05:21:26.910 --> 05:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
are up to the standards that they're
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
claiming to be similarly to the reason
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that you um that you license
 
05:21:34.708 --> 05:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
Occupational Health the reason that you
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
um sort or license speech therapists the
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
reason that you um licensed massage
 
05:21:43.510 --> 05:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
therapists in uh the state of New
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire secondly as Marissa's
 
05:21:46.080 --> 05:21:47.470 align:start position:0%
Hampshire secondly as Marissa's
testimony

05:21:47.470 --> 05:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted in order to work with um
 
05:21:54.510 --> 05:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and uh Medicaid they
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
require State licensed professionals um
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
to even begin the conversation and so
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
without a state license where we are um
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
relegated to working with any either
 
05:22:11.708 --> 05:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
private pay individuals which is um a
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
huge barrier for so many vulnerable
 
05:22:18.510 --> 05:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
populations and and or grant funding
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
which comes and goes um and a lot of a
 
05:22:24.030 --> 05:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
lot of our clients their services get
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
interrupted because the lack of funding
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
or a cut off at some point to grant
 
05:22:31.230 --> 05:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
funding when these are medical um
 
05:22:31.240 --> 05:22:32.350 align:start position:0%
funding when these are medical um
medically

05:22:32.350 --> 05:22:32.360 align:start position:0%

different professions or settings um

treatments how is it then that this bill
would

05:23:09.628 --> 05:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
not um make those people run a foul of
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
the new licensing
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
requirement for example if a

somehow plays some music but without
 
05:23:27.548 --> 05:23:27.558 align:start position:0%
calling it music therapy per se would
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
they not then be in violation of the new
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%

05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
Association um does not oppose the
 
05:26:15.910 --> 05:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
notion of Music therapist being licensed
 
05:26:18.270 --> 05:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
for sure uh we have some concerns
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the language of the bill as is
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
as it is written as and as it pertains
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
to the scope of practice um furthermore
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
I would be more than happy to offer some
 
05:26:29.788 --> 05:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
input on some additional language um
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
that might be considered to be added to
 
05:26:32.040 --> 05:26:35.470 align:start position:0%
that might be considered to be added to
this

05:26:35.470 --> 05:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.948 --> 05:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
bill um and the other thing I wanted to
 
05:26:40.110 --> 05:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
say is um mention in both the letters
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
that were sent and received by the U the
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
committee um we are requesting the
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
additional language to address um
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%

therapists and communication disorders
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
um in the uh language currently um and I
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
believe that's um
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
line five um this the last sentence the
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
practice of music therapy does not
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%

mental or communication disorder um I
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
would propose our our organization would
 
05:27:18.990 --> 05:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
propose um that added to that um would
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%

05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
with your Association and with your
 
05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
members uh in the previous go around
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
because of of a concern on on on your
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
your part I don't mean you specifically
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
but you know your profession your
 
05:29:25.750 --> 05:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
Association has had a concern of a you
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
know an improper balance or interaction
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
between music therapists and speech
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
pathologists and so forth which the
 
05:29:34.440 --> 05:29:35.390 align:start position:0%
pathologists and so forth which the
previous

05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
previous
 
05:29:40.030 --> 05:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh you know worked to uh to
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh modify the language of the B the
 
05:29:45.230 --> 05:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill last time in order to
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
resolve those issues and I and there
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
were some uh some amendments brought
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
with regard to the language uh that um
 
05:29:57.990 --> 05:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know that was in the original
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
Bill uh have you seen that
 
05:30:03.868 --> 05:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
have you seen the the results of that
 
05:30:07.548 --> 05:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
interaction um I believe uh from reading
 
05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
it it looks as though that there was
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
that specific language put in um that uh
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
let me just get to it I'm sorry excuse
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
me yes I believe that representative
 
05:30:21.150 --> 05:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
McGee should be more appropriate to
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
address this because is this bill the
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
same as what was amended by the house
 
05:30:28.990 --> 05:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
last term or is it uh what was initi
 
05:30:32.190 --> 05:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
initially proposed to the
 
05:30:32.200 --> 05:30:36.590 align:start position:0%
initially proposed to the
house

05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
cat I I agree representative McGee C
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
certainly should weigh in on this um
 
05:30:44.470 --> 05:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
because we want to those of us who are
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
proponents of music therapy uh lure in
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we do want to
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues because we don't
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
want to create a situation where music
 
05:30:57.310 --> 05:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
therapists are stepping in your on your
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
toes or you
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
are in prohibiting or or Banning uh
 
05:31:07.788 --> 05:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
preventing them from from practicing
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
their trade their profession um in a way
 
05:31:13.948 --> 05:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate for them we want to
 
05:31:16.830 --> 05:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues so that both sides
 
05:31:21.548 --> 05:31:21.558 align:start position:0%
uh can can go forward in in in assisting
 
05:31:23.470 --> 05:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh affected individuals in the state of
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh to to be to be
 
05:31:31.390 --> 05:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
benefited to be cured to be to be helped
 
05:31:34.150 --> 05:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
by your profession and music therapy as
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
well so that language situation is one
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
where I don't know if this is going to
 
05:31:41.310 --> 05:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
go to a subcommittee but but if it does
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh we would certainly like to have your
 
05:31:44.830 --> 05:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
involvement if representative McGee
 
05:31:48.190 --> 05:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
can't clarify that not it well
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGee if you could report
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
to us what the status is of the
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
Amendments that were discussed and
 
05:31:57.548 --> 05:31:57.558 align:start position:0%
adopted last year I would very much
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we don't need to discuss
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
it here
 
05:32:01.948 --> 05:32:01.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative SCH do you have a
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
question well just I think she's I spoke
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
to her last night about her bill she
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
also is concerned at her committee about
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
executing so I did text her here she
 
05:32:16.270 --> 05:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
comes there she
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
is yes representative McGee thank you we
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
had a question as to whether this is the
 
05:32:24.350 --> 05:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
as introduced version of the bill from
 
05:32:27.788 --> 05:32:27.798 align:start position:0%
last session or the as amended by
 
05:32:30.990 --> 05:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
Edna my understanding what I asked OSS
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
to do was to incorporate the most recent
 
05:32:35.590 --> 05:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment so it should be that and I
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I went and checked
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
for representative lakus uh in the
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um system and I do not see
 
05:32:48.830 --> 05:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
the music therapy lure Bill filed under
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh senator aar's name so yes I found out
 
05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
from talking to some Senators that they
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
have not yet released all their bills so
 
05:32:59.230 --> 05:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
it's possible it's still going through
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
the system
 
05:33:02.830 --> 05:33:02.840 align:start position:0%

05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
reached an accommodation where the
 
05:33:34.110 --> 05:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
language of our bill was was changed
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%

the question okay okay good I just don't
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
want to interrupt um again um I'll
 
05:34:00.750 --> 05:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate that uh we and New Hampshire
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
speech language and hearing Association
 
05:34:05.310 --> 05:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
aren't averse to the notion of lure for
 
05:34:07.750 --> 05:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
music therapist nor are we averse to the
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
presence or the existence of Music
 
05:34:11.548 --> 05:34:11.558 align:start position:0%
therapists I've worked alongside of
 
05:34:14.190 --> 05:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
Music therapists over the course of my
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
20 plus years doing this
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it was the language around um
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and treatment um diagnosis uh
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
an assessment and and U screening has
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
been addressed in the language but the
 
05:34:34.030 --> 05:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
treatment has not um that was concerning
 
05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
to us uh and you know the previous
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
speakers have talked about the need for
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
licensure to protect the public um and I
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
think it is I agree with them I think
 
05:34:45.670 --> 05:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's important for the public to know
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
that when there is a
 
05:34:50.670 --> 05:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
communication impairment that speech and
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
language Pathologists are the licensed
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
professionals um to treat to diagnose
 
05:35:01.150 --> 05:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
and treat those things um and I want to
 
05:35:03.590 --> 05:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
assure the public that there is that
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
delineation between the two professions
 
05:35:08.670 --> 05:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
um so that's why
 
05:35:12.310 --> 05:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're um pushing for the change or the
 
05:35:15.350 --> 05:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
additional language that addresses the
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
treatment of communication
 
05:35:22.350 --> 05:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
disorders thank you we'll work on that
 
05:35:25.470 --> 05:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%

some written testimony earlier I hope
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
you were able to see it and see the
 
05:36:09.788 --> 05:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
picture along with it that helps to put
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
a face to a name um Lucas has been
 
05:36:15.310 --> 05:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
involved in music therapy his whole life
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
he's an active boy who loves basketball
 
05:36:19.470 --> 05:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
making people laugh and anything that
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with music it's his number one
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
motivator um he's been through some
 
05:36:26.830 --> 05:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
significant trauma in his life and um
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
multiple medical procedures uh more than
 
05:36:29.280 --> 05:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
multiple medical procedures uh more than
40

05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
40
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
um in his short life while in the
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
hospital music therapy was always the
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that gave us his first smile
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
coming out of
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesia um music therapy helped him
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
take his first steps following his
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
tracheostomy procedure when he was
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
sedated for more than two weeks and we
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
brought our 5-year-old boy home as an
 
05:36:52.350 --> 05:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
infant uh not being able to walk again
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
um music therapy was the one thing that
 
05:36:57.868 --> 05:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
always pulled him out of it um we saw
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
such great progress with music y in the
 
05:37:01.750 --> 05:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
hospital that we as a family were
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
committed to doing whatever we needed to
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
in order for this to become part of his
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
weekly Services Lucas does receive
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
occupational physical and speech therapy
 
05:37:13.948 --> 05:37:13.958 align:start position:0%
for multiple sessions each week both
 
05:37:16.510 --> 05:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
privately and in the school setting uh
 
05:37:18.350 --> 05:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
these are all therapies that are covered
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
by his medical insurance that we provide
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
privately um for him as well as through
 
05:37:25.990 --> 05:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Katie Becket waiver the therapy that
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
he makes the most progress in and has
 
05:37:30.750 --> 05:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
always is his music y That's
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not a covered benefit uh
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
despite this being medically necessary
 
05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
for his overall uh growth and
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
development um it's not seen as a
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
licensed profession in the sense of the
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the insurance um and so
 
05:37:47.990 --> 05:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
insurance will not cover it um if we
 
05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
could get music therapy covered as a
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
benefit it could just help to um support
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
the other therapies that he does and
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
integrate them all together so that we
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
can have his biggest motivator along
 
05:38:02.110 --> 05:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the things uh that are most
 
05:38:05.150 --> 05:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
challenging for him currently we do have
 
05:38:07.110 --> 05:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
to pay out of pocket for this essential
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
service um he's been at risk multiple
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
times of losing it as two as a two uh
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
full-time income family it's still a
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
struggle sometimes and it's kind of
 
05:38:18.070 --> 05:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
always a first thing on the chopping
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
block because we all have priorities
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
that we have to do and we've always
 
05:38:24.510 --> 05:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
found a way to make this a priority and
 
05:38:27.270 --> 05:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
keep it um we have been committed for
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket for over four years
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
for this for Lucas um and we have worked
 
05:38:34.590 --> 05:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
with the same music therapist this whole
 
05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
time So for anybody who's familiar with
 
05:38:38.948 --> 05:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
therapies our children uh Lucas does
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
have Down syndrome and autism with ADHD
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
um our children go through multiple
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
therapists in all of the different
 
05:38:47.788 --> 05:38:47.798 align:start position:0%
professions and we've been really lucky
 
05:38:49.390 --> 05:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
to have the same therapist from the
 
05:38:51.548 --> 05:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
beginning that still currently works
 
05:38:54.628 --> 05:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
with him and pushes him even more um
 
05:38:57.788 --> 05:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
every week that he sees her so the cost
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
is unsustainable as a family long term
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the passage of House Bill 209 will
 
05:39:05.230 --> 05:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
help us to be able to get the coverage
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
um through the medical insurance that we
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
we pay for each year for him uh to help
 
05:39:12.430 --> 05:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
him receive these essential services and
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately others who cannot afford to
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
pay for it out of pocket again we're
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
really fortunate for that um but it is a
 
05:39:22.750 --> 05:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
high cost so we are in support of this
 
05:39:24.670 --> 05:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
we hope you will be in support of it um
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
to help not only Lucas but others in the
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
state receive such essential services
 
05:39:34.868 --> 05:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take some questions I
 
05:39:36.110 --> 05:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
could certainly
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
try thank you representative Roy um
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Young for taking my
 
05:39:43.510 --> 05:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
question um we've heard some testimony
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost of these sessions as
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
proposed uh from previous Witnesses but
 
05:39:50.110 --> 05:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you would mind sharing what
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
what your cost has been um per session
 
05:39:55.868 --> 05:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
for this out of Pock sure so Lucas has a
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
30 minute session uh he is he could
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
certainly sustain more but um I believe
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh out of pocket we do have it privately
 
05:40:05.670 --> 05:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
in our home so the therapist comes out
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
to our home I believe it's around um $50
 
05:40:11.788 --> 05:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
for the session and then an additional
 
05:40:14.468 --> 05:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
cost for the travel thank you very much
 
05:40:17.390 --> 05:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
half an hour session thank you very much
 
05:40:17.400 --> 05:40:19.310 align:start position:0%
half an hour session thank you very much

05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
people relocate to their college towns
 
05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
or the state that their college was in
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
and do not return to their home
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
communities according to research done
 
05:41:39.628 --> 05:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
by economic modeling State University
 
05:41:41.788 --> 05:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
graduates are most likely to permanently
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
live within state lines and 40% of those
 
05:41:47.708 --> 05:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
students live within 50 miles of their
 
05:41:47.718 --> 05:41:48.670 align:start position:0%

05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
mater prospective music therapists from
 
05:41:54.310 --> 05:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are required to relocate
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
for their education and often do not
 
05:41:59.830 --> 05:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
come back it is clear that there is a
 
05:42:01.830 --> 05:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
need for music therapy services in our
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
state and who would be better at
 
05:42:05.670 --> 05:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
addressing those needs than people born
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
and raised
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
here in 2014 Rhode Island passed a music
 
05:42:15.310 --> 05:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
therapy lure Bill similar to HB 209 and
 
05:42:17.788 --> 05:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
in the fall of 2020 the University of
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island welcomed its first class of
 
05:42:22.750 --> 05:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
music therapy students while there are
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
currently no music therapy degree
 
05:42:26.990 --> 05:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
programs in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will provide new opportunities
 
05:42:31.708 --> 05:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
in the state for practitioners and
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
patients and in the years to come we
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
hope that young people will have the
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to study in their home state
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
bringing their knowledge and experience
 
05:42:42.750 --> 05:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
to our New Hampshire
 
05:42:44.910 --> 05:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
communities along with access and
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
improved awareness of music therapy will
 
05:42:49.150 --> 05:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
come a need for qualified
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners according to the US Bureau
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
of Labor Statistics the job growth
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
outlook for counselors and social
 
05:42:59.310 --> 05:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
service specialists is 14% in the next
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
five years and 25% more mental health
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
therapists and providers will be needed
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the coming years which greatly
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
exceeds the average 4% growth for other
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
fields the need for music therapists in
 
05:43:16.750 --> 05:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will only continue to grow
 
05:43:18.430 --> 05:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
and along with that need will come a
 
05:43:21.310 --> 05:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
need for affordable access to care which
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
as you've heard is not being
 
05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
met my clients greatly benefit from the
 
05:43:29.430 --> 05:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
unique modality of Music the therapy
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
often families are challenged to stretch
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
their limited funding so they can access
 
05:43:38.750 --> 05:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
Services even if only for a short time
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
although my clients have adequate Health
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
Care coverage music therapy cannot be
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
covered due to lack of practitioner
 
05:43:49.628 --> 05:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
licensure music therapists have met all
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
of the requirements by our national
 
05:43:54.510 --> 05:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
governing boards but State lure is a
 
05:43:56.910 --> 05:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
barrier that stands between our clients
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
getting the services they need for
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
provided to them for a reasonable fee
 
05:44:02.670 --> 05:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
through their health
 
05:44:05.548 --> 05:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
insurance in closing I ask that you vote
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
Yes for New Hampshire
 
05:44:10.110 --> 05:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
hb29 establishing a music therapy
 
05:44:12.670 --> 05:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire will allow more
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
consumers to access music therapy
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
services potentially increasing
 
05:44:19.830 --> 05:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
education opportunities for future music
 
05:44:22.708 --> 05:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
therapists and absolutely increased job
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities in this state thank you
 
05:44:27.468 --> 05:44:27.478 align:start position:0%

05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
support thank you are there questions
 
05:44:33.390 --> 05:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:52.270 --> 05:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
Ali hello and thank you for taking the
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
time uh my name is Nicole om Al and I am
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
not a New Hampshire resident I'm here
 
05:45:00.510 --> 05:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
testifying um I'm from Rhode Island I am
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
the government relations representative
 
05:45:05.110 --> 05:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the task force where
 
05:45:07.390 --> 05:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
similar legislation was passed so I'm
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
here to try to provide Clarity on the
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
impact of lure um from our state's
 
05:45:16.830 --> 05:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
organization I do not want to be
 
05:45:20.468 --> 05:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
redundant on what's already been said um
 
05:45:23.830 --> 05:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
I do know and can also testify to the
 
05:45:28.110 --> 05:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
risks of um well-intended misinformed
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
musicians practicing as music
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
therapists um and increasing Equitable
 
05:45:36.990 --> 05:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
access of music therapy to vulnerable
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
populations that occurs with legislation
 
05:45:43.468 --> 05:45:43.478 align:start position:0%
since our legislation passed we have had
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
an increase in jobs we also did um start
 
05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
a degree program at a State University
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
um started to explore insurance
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement which was not even an
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
option or up for conversation prior to
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
um The
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
Lure and um I also wanted to touch on um
 
05:46:09.230 --> 05:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the opposition from Asha as we also
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
faced this um we as music therapists um
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
we do not as was discussed claimed to
 
05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
diagnose clients we do treat and if we
 
05:46:22.590 --> 05:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
were to remove treatment um you know
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're not able to collaborate
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
with a speech therapist for a number of
 
05:46:29.548 --> 05:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
reasons I can personally speak to a few
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
cases where a client was discharged from
 
05:46:33.868 --> 05:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
speech therapy because they were no
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
longer making adequate progress they had
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
plateaued we were able to provide
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based music therapy
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
interventions focusing
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
on language and then we referred them
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
when they started making progress again
 
05:46:52.270 --> 05:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
back to speech therapy um and they were
 
05:46:55.628 --> 05:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
able to continue to make progress um so
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
again that would be a case where we
 
05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
would not be able to work with one of
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
the speech therapists um this opposition
 
05:47:05.230 --> 05:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
music therapists and speech therapists
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
have worked together collaboratively
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
alongside one another for a long time
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
and have rarely I rarely have as a
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
clinician have had any challenges with
 
05:47:18.390 --> 05:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
um speech therapists I find the
 
05:47:21.070 --> 05:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
opposition seems to be coming from a
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
political standpoint and um you know
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
when when we went through this
 
05:47:28.510 --> 05:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um you know they talked
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
about about how we did not want to
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
create an oligarchy where one type of
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
service disenfranchised another um when
 
05:47:38.590 --> 05:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're all out for the benefit of the
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
client um so in Rhode Island and I'm
 
05:47:43.708 --> 05:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
happy to share it we defined a scope of
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
practice with the president of the Rhode
 
05:47:49.150 --> 05:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
Island Asha chapter um we looked at you
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
know again we outlined Diagnostics we
 
05:47:53.910 --> 05:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
outlined what goals might look like um
 
05:47:55.868 --> 05:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
so that might be a Way Forward because
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
by eliminating treating it means that
 
05:48:01.750 --> 05:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
anyone with a disorder of communication
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
or speech would not be able to access
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
music therapy so I would um personally
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
probably be concerned about that um I
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
also have I'm I also sometimes come and
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
approach as a as a caregiver I have
 
05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
young children with medical needs and we
 
05:48:23.190 --> 05:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
have actually been um in hospitals where
 
05:48:27.390 --> 05:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
they have received um misrepresentation
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of music therapy where we had
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
well-informed uh well-intended
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
misinformed musicians um try to you know
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
offer their services as music therapists
 
05:48:41.708 --> 05:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
to my own children um and their
 
05:48:44.310 --> 05:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
practitioners also now actually speak to
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
the harm that it caused they you know
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
stimulative sedative music um there's a
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
lot you can do as a music therapist with
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
these evidence-based interventions and
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
those evidence-based interventions also
 
05:48:59.548 --> 05:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
have a counter um so just as a more
 
05:49:02.430 --> 05:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
concrete example we know that music can
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
elicit um to decrease or increase
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
Cravings in substance use disorders um
 
05:49:09.548 --> 05:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
you need a trained professional that
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
knows what those parameters are in order
 
05:49:14.468 --> 05:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
to make sure they decrease not increase
 
05:49:18.430 --> 05:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
um so I appreciate your time again I I'm
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
trying to skip through what's already
 
05:49:23.868 --> 05:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
been said and try to focus on what um
 
05:49:26.390 --> 05:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
might be helpful from my professional
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
experience and
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
expertise thank you for your time thank
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you very much are questions from the
 
05:49:36.468 --> 05:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
committee yes yes of course
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid thank you very
 
05:49:41.708 --> 05:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair and thank you also Miss
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
Ali for being here to speak with us uh
 
05:49:47.230 --> 05:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
are you able to provide us with some uh
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
written material in support of your uh
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony sure um I did provide a
 
05:49:54.670 --> 05:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony but if there's
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
something specific you're looking for my
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
email is on that and I'm happy to
 
05:50:00.510 --> 05:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
provide anything additional that would
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
help the committee well the reason I ask
 
05:50:06.750 --> 05:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
is because because you're um your your
 
05:50:09.390 --> 05:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
testimony has has has filled out a lot
 
05:50:11.670 --> 05:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
of gaps I think that I and my colleagues
 
05:50:14.750 --> 05:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
may have had with regard to uh some of
 
05:50:16.590 --> 05:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
the aspects of music therapy because
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's not so obvious to somebody who is
 
05:50:22.030 --> 05:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
not uh you know in the field or hasn't
 
05:50:24.390 --> 05:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
had a child that has benefited from
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
music therapy uh to visualize exactly
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on and how it works and why
 
05:50:34.468 --> 05:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
this helps that or doesn't help this or
 
05:50:36.868 --> 05:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
this method method of doing it works and
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't uh so the your testimony
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
has been much more concrete than we have
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
heard in some instances before and we
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
need to have that I think so to the
 
05:50:47.948 --> 05:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
degree that you can provide it that
 
05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
helpful I believe the WR testimony was
 
05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
already provided to us okay I I haven't
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
seen it so I'm glad to hear that and for
 
05:51:00.990 --> 05:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
anyone that um it would be helpful my
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
daughter is now nine and she recalls her
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
experience and has
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
um I videoed her response so I'm happy
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
to provide my nine-year-olds testimony
 
05:51:14.030 --> 05:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
as well for anyone who might thank you
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%

Madame chairwoman and members of the

committee I am the past president past
 
05:52:09.868 --> 05:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
vice president of governmental Affairs
 
05:52:11.230 --> 05:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire speech language
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
hearing Association and I was in on the
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
hearings last
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
year and the bill the Amendments the
 
05:52:23.468 --> 05:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
changes to the this bill from last bill
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
are excellent we just wanted a little
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
bit more um
 
05:52:32.390 --> 05:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
Neil toia covered most of what I would
 
05:52:36.030 --> 05:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
say but I would also like to just um
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
make a few points one being for an
 
05:52:42.510 --> 05:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
activity to be therapeutic there has to
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
be a treatment plan there have to be
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
goals there have to be reasons while
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing that specific activity
 
05:52:50.680 --> 05:52:52.468 align:start position:0%
you're doing that specific activity
um

05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:58.468 --> 05:52:58.478 align:start position:0%
the you can't for for example if I was
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
reading to a
 
05:53:02.590 --> 05:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
two-year-old okay I'm reading to a
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
two-year-old could I call that speech
 
05:53:07.708 --> 05:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
therapy no not without or language
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
therapy not without specific reasons why
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
specific um children's literature for
 
05:53:16.280 --> 05:53:18.150 align:start position:0%
specific um children's literature for
example

05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:53:24.150 --> 05:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so I could use music in doing speech
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
and language therapy but my goalss would
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
be speech and language goals they
 
05:53:37.390 --> 05:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
goals does that answer a question that
 
05:53:42.868 --> 05:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:42.878 --> 05:53:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

05:53:45.230 --> 05:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:53:48.670 --> 05:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
about untrained music the people who are
 
05:53:51.510 --> 05:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
untrained and calling themselves music
 
05:53:54.788 --> 05:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
therapists can go in and play the guitar
 
05:53:57.788 --> 05:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
but that's not not therapy because they
 
05:53:57.798 --> 05:53:58.990 align:start position:0%
but that's not not therapy because they
don't

05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.868 --> 05:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
activity we're not opposed to um
 
05:54:18.230 --> 05:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
licensing music
 
05:54:21.150 --> 05:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
therapists we just want to
 
05:54:21.160 --> 05:54:23.190 align:start position:0%
therapists we just want to
clarify

05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
the parameters of what they do and what
 
05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
we do and we would we do work together
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
I'd be very interested in what um Rhode
 
05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
Island had worked out in terms of their
 
05:54:36.430 --> 05:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill and how
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
that made it more clear
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
um my concern one of my concerns is that
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
if the public thinks that music
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
disorders will they actually get the
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
speech and language therapy that they
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.200 --> 05:55:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:55:03.948 --> 05:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would like the bill to
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
address treatment of the underlying
 
05:55:09.718 --> 05:55:10.990 align:start position:0%
address treatment of the underlying
communication

05:55:10.990 --> 05:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
communication
 
05:55:14.190 --> 05:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
disorders um Miss Scott mentioned that
 
05:55:20.468 --> 05:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:20.478 --> 05:55:22.868 align:start position:0%
 
language

05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:55:25.390 --> 05:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay but they need to they don't have
 
05:55:29.190 --> 05:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
the training in language development
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
that speech and language Pathologists do
 
05:55:32.280 --> 05:55:33.868 align:start position:0%
that speech and language Pathologists do
also

05:55:33.868 --> 05:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:55:38.910 --> 05:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
um oh yes Miss Ali brought up the issue
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
of Consulting with the speech and
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
language pathologist if someone is not
 
05:55:44.510 --> 05:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
receiving speech and language
 
05:55:47.310 --> 05:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
therapy while they're receiving music
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
therapy they don't need to consult with
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
the speech language
 
05:55:54.150 --> 05:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
pathologist it's only when both
 
05:55:56.430 --> 05:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
activities are going on at the same time
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
and it's important that all thies work
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
together Physical Therapy occupational
 
05:56:03.548 --> 05:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
therapy speech and language therapy and
 
05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
music therapy that that wasn't
 
05:56:09.788 --> 05:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
um I would think that an occupational
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
therapist would be interested
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
in what a music therapist was doing or a
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
physical therapist was doing as well but
 
05:56:18.310 --> 05:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
we're only really concerned with speech
 
05:56:21.070 --> 05:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
and language therapy and
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
Audiology I don't
 
05:56:26.070 --> 05:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
know how much
 
05:56:29.070 --> 05:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
um crossover there is between music
 
05:56:30.990 --> 05:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
therapy and ideology but one example
 
05:56:33.708 --> 05:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
that was given last year as could be
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental was that a non-trained a
 
05:56:39.230 --> 05:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
person who is not trained as a music
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
therapist could be playing music too
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
loud for someone with hearing aids or
 
05:56:47.948 --> 05:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
with someone with or for anyone but
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
specifically someone with hearing aids
 
05:56:49.638 --> 05:56:51.430 align:start position:0%
specifically someone with hearing aids
would

05:56:51.430 --> 05:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.310 --> 05:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much Miss cheser
 
05:57:03.270 --> 05:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
committee looks like Neil might have a
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
question his hand was raised yes well
 
05:57:10.510 --> 05:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's this is the time for the
 
05:57:14.590 --> 05:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%

05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
I if I could just briefly respond to a
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
couple of things um that one of the
 
05:57:38.430 --> 05:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
speakers um I believe the woman from
 
05:57:41.070 --> 05:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island I'm sorry Her Name Escapes
 
05:57:43.110 --> 05:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
me but
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things is I wanted to say
 
05:57:50.270 --> 05:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a political um issue for our
 
05:57:53.390 --> 05:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
organization not
 
05:57:55.948 --> 05:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um I'm a New Hampshire
 
05:57:58.750 --> 05:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
resident have been for over over three
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
decades um I attended the University of
 
05:58:03.910 --> 05:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for my graduate work in
 
05:58:05.190 --> 05:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
speech language
 
05:58:05.200 --> 05:58:07.948 align:start position:0%
speech language
pathology

05:58:07.948 --> 05:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
pathology
 
05:58:10.750 --> 05:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that concerned me
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
was the idea or the notion that there if
 
05:58:15.910 --> 05:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a speech language
 
05:58:18.510 --> 05:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
pathologist available they can work on
 
05:58:21.708 --> 05:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
those things and she
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
um alluded to that in her uh testimony
 
05:58:29.868 --> 05:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
but I would say I work with clients all
 
05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
the time where perhaps they're eliciting
 
05:58:36.590 --> 05:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
a fine motor or a gross motor
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
problem and that's really the domain of
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
the physical therapist or the
 
05:58:43.708 --> 05:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist um in the absence
 
05:58:47.110 --> 05:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
of there one being an OT or a PT
 
05:58:49.948 --> 05:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
available I would not pursue working on
 
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
fine motor or gross motor simply because
 
05:58:54.110 --> 05:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
of there's an absence of that and that
 
05:58:57.468 --> 05:58:57.478 align:start position:0%
the person certainly needs that help um
 
05:58:59.548 --> 05:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
I stay within my scope of practice and
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have a very broad scope of practice
 
05:59:04.270 --> 05:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
mind you but nonetheless there are
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
parameters and borders that I do not
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
cross as a
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
professional um so just because the
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
orthodontist is not available the
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
hygienist doesn't apply the braces um it
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
just doesn't get done
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um as far as safety is
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
concerned again and Victoria um did
 
05:59:29.230 --> 05:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
mention this but I'll just re re recast
 
05:59:33.310 --> 05:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
it um that we can't have patients with
 
05:59:35.948 --> 05:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
communication disorders or impairments
 
05:59:38.910 --> 05:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
seeking assistance
 
05:59:41.910 --> 05:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
from clinicians or therapists that are
 
05:59:45.430 --> 05:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
not trained to the degree or that we
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
are we specialize in these communication
 
05:59:51.708 --> 05:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
impairments this is how we're trained
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
with very extensive training that
 
05:59:55.230 --> 05:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
training was laid out in the letters
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we sent to the the committee
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
um and I think in terms of in the name
 
06:00:03.190 --> 06:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety we would we would not
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
want somebody that's not adequately
 
06:00:08.548 --> 06:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
trained or competent to do that to have
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that and that's why we
 
06:00:15.990 --> 06:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh request that that treatment um
 
06:00:18.510 --> 06:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
language be put in there and I would be
 
06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee uh if
 
06:00:25.150 --> 06:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
they so choose to wish for my help um in
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
helping uh um collab orate with that
 
06:00:31.830 --> 06:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in um the
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
language thank you we'll let you know
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
when when and if there is such a meeting
 
06:00:38.670 --> 06:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having me the
 
06:00:40.030 --> 06:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
06:00:43.070 --> 06:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
speak is there anyone else who wish oh
 
06:00:45.230 --> 06:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shu you have a
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
question yes Madam chair I do thank you
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
a question just occurred to me for uh
 
06:00:53.230 --> 06:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps Mr
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
demia um or one of the speech language
 
06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
pathologists I'm curious if there is
 
06:01:03.830 --> 06:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
ever an instance where someone in that
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
profession would in fact refer a client
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
to a music
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
therapist um I would answer yes to that
 
06:01:18.510 --> 06:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
um and that would be our ethical and
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
clinical U obligation if we're working
 
06:01:24.788 --> 06:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
with a client and we see that that
 
06:01:28.030 --> 06:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
client has a need or could benefit
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh from a type of therapy that we are
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
not um competently uh or legally able to
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide uh we would and we do we make
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
referrals all the time I refer out to um
 
06:01:42.910 --> 06:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I've worked across you
 
06:01:45.030 --> 06:01:45.040 align:start position:0%

06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Center in the ICU and CCU uh you
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%

people on on endot tral tubes getting
 
06:01:56.270 --> 06:01:56.280 align:start position:0%

06:01:58.830 --> 06:01:58.840 align:start position:0%

06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%

settings nursing homes hospitals um and
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%

OTS pts music therapists dietitians um
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people on the medical
 
06:02:18.430 --> 06:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
team and um certainly uh referring out
 
06:02:21.190 --> 06:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate clinician when we see
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
that there may be a need for that um is
 
06:02:28.110 --> 06:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
certainly something we do yes
 
06:02:31.190 --> 06:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you who has a questiones represent
 
06:02:32.948 --> 06:02:32.958 align:start position:0%

06:02:36.310 --> 06:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Madame
 
06:02:40.430 --> 06:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
chair the bill from last year the issue
 
06:02:43.628 --> 06:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
this this really the Crux of this bill
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
is um G is having the music therapist be
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
paid by insurance I was on a
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that involved this um Bill
 
06:02:55.948 --> 06:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
last year and I think we noodled out all
 
06:02:58.628 --> 06:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
the issues that the speech therapist had
 
06:03:02.430 --> 06:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
with the music therapist on this
 
06:03:08.270 --> 06:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
that who is a question for I apologize
 
06:03:16.390 --> 06:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's either for Mr themia or I guess it
 
06:03:20.430 --> 06:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
would be M Mr themia yeah okay thank you
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
um as Mrs chesterly had said uh prior um
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the collaboration with the
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
committee on the previous house bill I
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
06:03:34.910 --> 06:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
1286 uh was previous form um we we did
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
um rais concerns and and had input and
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh we appreciate that the committee did
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
make changes to that um I think really
 
06:03:44.910 --> 06:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
the only change that I would be
 
06:03:47.590 --> 06:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
requesting that hadn't been made I say
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
me but the organization in which I
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
represent um would be the um language
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
around the treatment um again uh and the
 
06:03:58.270 --> 06:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
reason or rational behind that would be
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
simply if if the consumer that is the U
 
06:04:06.868 --> 06:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
patient client uh is uh seeking help for
 
06:04:10.590 --> 06:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
communication and pment that uh they
 
06:04:13.708 --> 06:04:13.718 align:start position:0%
need to be directed to the clinicians
 
06:04:15.788 --> 06:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
that are trained specifically in
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
communication impairments and disorders
 
06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
which is what speech language
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
Pathologists do that is the primary
 
06:04:24.750 --> 06:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
focus of what we
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
do thank you are there other questions
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.110 --> 06:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none is there anyone
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
