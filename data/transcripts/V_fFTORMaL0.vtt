00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
belt

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative green could speak
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
well we just thought there's a lot more
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
work that need to be done on it i mean
 
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.670 align:start position:0%
work that need to be done on it i mean
um

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
you have certain factions who really
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
hate the bill
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
the legal community from what we did in
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
customary really didn't like the bill
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
but uh they were just we didn't have
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
we couldn't come to a consensus to it
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
how does it feel so
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
all right thanks yes representative
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
mclean i think as well there was some
 
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.710 align:start position:0%
mclean i think as well there was some
concerns

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
about the mechanics of the bill you know
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
the concept is good
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
but there were concerns about the
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
mechanics of the bill and we also did
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
want to put business owners
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
in in the place of being law enforcement
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
as were so
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
there were some things that we wanted to
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
tease out and felt that
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
any other comments or discussion
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain the bill
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
and see no other comments
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you call the roll format
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%

let's build 216 an act relative to
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
public notice of
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
access to meetings under the right to
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's representative alexander yeah
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i move um hb 216
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
i'll second that is it
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak to yes
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually going to speak against
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislative somebody
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
else wants to speak to it first
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
oh sorry i couldn't hear if
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative walper said something
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
good alexander did you want to speak to
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
your itl
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
first um well i think this bill
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit more work i don't
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
think that we have necessarily
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
a need for it at this time i think
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other groups have
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
done a great job um
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know adjusting to the realities we
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that itlling this bill
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
is the best way forward thank you
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
having seconded i just i just want to
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
add my comments uh the
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
the one thing about this particular
 
00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.150 align:start position:0%
the one thing about this particular
build

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
i i think uh i'm not opposed to having
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
the remote access
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
but if i read this bill it lets members
 
00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
but if i read this bill it lets members
decide

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to be able to
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
access meetings
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
remotely as opposed to letting the
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
public body make that decision
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think ultimately it should be the body
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that decides whether or not its members
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
should be able to participate
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
remotely so that's why
 
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
remotely so that's why
i

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh have heard from a lot of folks in my
 
00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh have heard from a lot of folks in my
district

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
town officials and others who have
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
really appreciated using the remote
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
access to meetings and so i if this
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
motion were to fail i have an amendment
 
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.189 align:start position:0%
motion were to fail i have an amendment
that

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
um does a few things that would help it
 
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.189 align:start position:0%
um does a few things that would help it
um

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think be more acceptable to folks i i
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if i
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
am uh permitted to mention what those
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
things are now
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
or not but um it does help with
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
an issue that the um municipal
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
association had i talked to them
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
and and added um changed language there
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
um as well as changed whoever has the
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
authority to make the meeting remote
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
change that to the public body as
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to the member
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and then also added in in
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh clarification to deal with the chat
 
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
uh clarification to deal with the chat
function

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
so i i think that it'd be i don't know
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
if anyone read my amendment
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
but um i i think we could fix some
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
things that might make it amenable
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
to folks but thank you for letting me
 
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:03.189 align:start position:0%
to folks but thank you for letting me
speak

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sylvia
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i am opposed to
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
these remote meetings in in every
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
possible way
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
um i it
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
it it appears to be
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
more transparent but the fact of the
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
matter is that
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's less transparent it's
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's less organized the people may have
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
speak to the legislators but frankly a
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
lot of times we don't know if the
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
legislators are actually
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
um listening or hearing um
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know we we tend to do
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
other things while we are in our homes
 
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.509 align:start position:0%
other things while we are in our homes
we

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
tend to forget that we are in our homes
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we are not
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
in a body that deserves a little more
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
of a formal setting and
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not this particular bill i also
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
have an amendment for
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
mcguire's bill the last one that we'll
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
be hearing to
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
take out that portion of her bill that
 
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.389 align:start position:0%
take out that portion of her bill that
is

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
to do with uh public uh
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
remote hearings so i i i just think the
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
that the process is uh terrible it's
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
awkward it doesn't get the attention
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
that uh it really deserves
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
and to pretend that we are giving folks
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
more access is a disservice to them
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
um yes i just want to say this has been
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
this has been one of the few things
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've had to do since events of almost
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
exactly a year ago the public actually
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
likes so
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
this has proven me very popular um i've
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
both uh this body that belongs to the
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
house and with the senate and also a
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
municipal government so public um
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
participation hearings has gone up and
 
00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:06.949 align:start position:0%
participation hearings has gone up and
also

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the case of legislature we now
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
automatically have a recording of
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
everything that happens in the
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
mini room which sometimes is good i mean
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
science is bad but i think that's a huge
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
step forward before the only record
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
you just can't stay but not that our
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
clerk doesn't do great work but still
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's a much less complete record than
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
what we have now so i think this is a i
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a large step for
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much mr chair um
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
i um i am
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to the itl motion
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
um i want this
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be over i don't want to be on
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
any longer i want us to be sitting
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
amongst each other where we can exchange
 
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
amongst each other where we can exchange
views

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
views
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
and influence each other in a positive
 
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.029 align:start position:0%
and influence each other in a positive
way

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
however forced to have
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
these zoom calls forced to look at these
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
little postage stamp
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
pictures of my colleagues on nonetheless
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
it has been clear to me that
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
this process which is painful for us
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
has opened up the legislative process
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
in just the way it should as we look
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the number of people who are
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
attending today there happen to be only
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
42 people
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
who are in the attendees list more
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
than could comfortably fit in our
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
committee room and we have had
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people watching us uh
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
are elected to represent the people
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's why they call us representatives
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
and this uh gives us an opportunity
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
to grow and learn from what had been a
 
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
to grow and learn from what had been a
very

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
for me certainly has been a very painful
 
00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
for me certainly has been a very painful
time

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
um as we approach our one year
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
anniversary of our
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
20-hour session i
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
would like to commend representative
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
simpson who listed
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
listen very very carefully to every
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
question that was raised
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
public particularly the institutions
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we tend to listen to
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
and her amendment which has been sent to
 
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.710 align:start position:0%
and her amendment which has been sent to
everybody

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
addresses every one of those concerns
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that the committee
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
support the itl and would instead
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
consider otpa thank you mr chair
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
so everything that's been said so far
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
is accurate and for me
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
i got two perspectives on this one is
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
the burden on the record-keeping
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
of these things is enormously more than
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
it was before
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
this is my second uh term as courtroom
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i have so much work this year that
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
for a job but it is
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions about
 
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.789 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of questions about
security

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
and control of meetings dur using these
 
00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:56.710 align:start position:0%
and control of meetings dur using these
technology

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
the technology that we're using today i
 
00:20:59.440 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
the technology that we're using today i
know

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
board members of boards and towns
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
who have are absolutely beside
 
00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:07.190 align:start position:0%
who have are absolutely beside
themselves

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
because they have on pocket reviews and
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
they aren't allowed to speak
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
remote from remote during their meetings
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
because somebody's sitting in the office
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
just puts them on you there are a lot of
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
other questions to go with
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so i don't think we're ready to do
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
this on a broad-based basis
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that we are but i don't
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
think we are
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative smith did
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
you want to speak again
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
um if that's all right with everyone i
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
would like to speak again
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
what representative walper uh notes
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
he has two points one of which i
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
completely agree with
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that is um that the system as
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
it is right now puts um
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on those individuals who
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
in the legislature who have volunteered
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
to be clerk
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that there are ways
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
of dealing with that
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
when we ask the staff and others
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
to focus on that um i have some ideas
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative welker does
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
the other point that representative
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
welper made on completely in sympathy
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
with him
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
but the story he tells
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
is the story of someone with behavior
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
unconscionable by muting
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
someone within with a an unpopular view
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe that by
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
having that come out in the open
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
and challenging it and making clear that
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
in a civil society we expect
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
disparate views and we respect to expect
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
to respect those disparate views
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
i see that as a plus because
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is transparent now
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
and totally unacceptable
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
and one would hope that either the
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
behavior would change or the person who
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
inappropriately behaved that way
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
would be embarrassed and or
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
those people who elected him or her or
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
appointed him or her
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
would have learned not to do that again
 
00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:30.630 align:start position:0%
would have learned not to do that again
so

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as a negative
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see the clerk responsibility as
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
a permanent reason and the pluses
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
of involving the community in ways that
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
they had never been involved before
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
and holding us accountable i believe
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
strongly outweigh
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
the negatives and the if the municipal
 
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
the negatives and the if the municipal
association

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
be very clear and very strong
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
in their positions nonetheless could
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
listen to representative simpson and
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
accept her
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion for correcting their concern
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to give particular
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
credence to that
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
to reward them so that perhaps next time
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
they'll also consider amendments
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um i wanted to clarify one of
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues the municipal association was
 
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.149 align:start position:0%
issues the municipal association was
concerned

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't want there to have to be a
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
remote meeting
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
if there was a physical location of the
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
meeting so that
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
that would be part of a potential if we
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
voted on an amendment that'd be part of
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment that if there is a
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
physical location there would be no
 
00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:51.830 align:start position:0%
physical location there would be no
requirement

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
for uh remote accidents
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
any other maybe communities that wanted
 
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
any other maybe communities that wanted
this

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
if not the the pending motion is
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
legislate and uh
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we if in fact that fails we'll deal
 
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.269 align:start position:0%
and we if in fact that fails we'll deal
with

00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative simpson's uh potential
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
amendment at the time
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
but we're going to vote on it expedient
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
to legislate and i'll ask the clerk to
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
follow the rules house bill 216
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
in expediency i just wait representative
 
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.310 align:start position:0%

house bill 232 an act relative to
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
under the right to know i have a
 
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.549 align:start position:0%
under the right to know i have a
promotion

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'd like to move otp
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh just as a reminder this uh kind
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
of started with a uh
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
an issue in laconia that we happen to
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
find out about
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
where a property purchase was
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
negotiated and consummated in a
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
non-public session and
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
in fact buried in some bonding issues
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
given obscure names
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill uh allows the
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
price negotiation to happen in the
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
the portion of that purchase
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
is going to happen in a public meeting
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
so this uh adds transparency to a
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
and representative oh yes i was going to
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
jump in and make the opposite motion
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
so just so um which i think is a proper
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
motion i think
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
um even that one instance i think
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't prove that any
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
law like this is unnecessary i'm not
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to say that
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh the transaction was done right or
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
wrong but i think that was uh
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
there were probably probably our
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons for um
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
moving secret anyway eventually
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
eventually it all
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
comes out in public anyway so i think we
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be uh
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
making this law just to deal with that
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
one situation in laconia which um
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
i i i'm not even sure if that
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
situational company i
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
never got a good explanation of why what
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
happened was so terrible so
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh i just think this is
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bill so i would urge you to
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
turn down the octopass so then an
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
alternative motion of interconnected
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
legislate can
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
be reintroduced so thanks
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's no other discussion
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%

and the motion about the tax
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%

that's always 15 in the affirmative six
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the negative
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
vote being 15 to 6 the motion of
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
big speed the legislative carries that
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
would be the recommendation will there

this requires uh two-thirds of the house
in

the senate in order to uh take property
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
i think that uh where we are talking
 
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.230 align:start position:0%
i think that uh where we are talking
about

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
one of the most fundamental rights that
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
are in our constitution
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
basically part first article one and two
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
protect our property rights
 
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.430 align:start position:0%
protect our property rights
and

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
an emergency that would require
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of taking that is a real
 
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.950 align:start position:0%
some sort of taking that is a real
emergency

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
would not even stop to look at what the
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
statute says so
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
if there is time for the governor and
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
the council to
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
consider an emergency taking then there
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
is time to involve
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
also the uh
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
the senate in the house thank you
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative burch thank you mr chair
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
um i speak in opposition to this bill
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh i found the argument just presented
 
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.750 align:start position:0%
uh i found the argument just presented
curious

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
in that the sponsor suggests that in a
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
real emergency
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
people would just ignore this
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislation anyway
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i scarcely think that's a
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
a good basis to to pass legislation
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
under a theory that will be ignored
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
um i discussed during
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
our hearing uh about the
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh difficulty in envisioning
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
how this would work uh in the state in
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
the time of a natural disaster
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
not the fact of uh emergency
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
nobody discussed so i want to discuss
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
for just a moment
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
the practical aspect of this bill
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh as as churchill said however
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
beautiful the strategy
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
you should occasionally look at the
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
results um
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
this calls for the meeting during an
 
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.829 align:start position:0%
this calls for the meeting during an
emergency

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the house and senate uh
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's two ways that the house and
 
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.309 align:start position:0%
there's two ways that the house and
senate

00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
meet they meet in regular session and
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
they meet in special session
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
so let's say this is a call that would
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
have to be done by
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
special special session there's two ways
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
especially call the legislature together
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
by special session
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
one requires an act by the governor and
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
then presumably notice goes out to 424
 
00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
then presumably notice goes out to 424
people

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then there's uh a decision to be
 
00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:45.750 align:start position:0%
and then there's uh a decision to be
made

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
where they're going to meet i understand
 
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:48.870 align:start position:0%
where they're going to meet i understand
uh

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
my friend from belmont is not in favor
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
of remote meetings
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
so they would have to find a place for
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
the 424 people to meet
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
i suspect that would take a week or two
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh to get done
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then notice and the like the other
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
method of course
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
is the legislature can call itself into
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
is the legislature can call itself into
session

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh that requires according to rsa
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
16 starting with a petition of not less
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
than 50 members
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
that goes out uh and then there's a male
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
vote by the entire body
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
once all the mail is collected and
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
counted if that passes then a special
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
session can be called
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
into uh being and
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh that'll probably add an extra three
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
or four weeks
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the process it's it's called an
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
emergency because it's an
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
emergency and the idea
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
where we can't get our own regular
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
sessions going
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that in the middle of an
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
emergency there's an
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
act of god that's there's flooding in
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
concord or
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's a major fire and they need
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh emergency management needs to
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
move heavy equipment and it might be on
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's property
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
or set up a uh sandbags or
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be on a temporary basis
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to wait two three four
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe five weeks to get 424 people
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
maybe five weeks to get 424 people
together

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
in some manner probably not remote um
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
to vote the power to do so is just
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
is it's a non-starter i mean i
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
understand the wish to
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh diminish the the governor's power
 
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
uh diminish the the governor's power
here

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
um i i share some of that but
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is just a ineffectual way to
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i urge a uh rejection
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the uh the otp motion
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
my representative burch said a lot of
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to say
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
but first of all i want to say i hope
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
i hope no one is inferring that what
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
we've survived for the last year and
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
what's going to be going
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
on for a while longer um hopefully we'll
 
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
on for a while longer um hopefully we'll
be

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
back to some sort of new normal pretty
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
soon but it's going to be a while um
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully nobody thinks that that's not
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
a real emergency i don't think i've ever
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
lived through any national emergency or
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
global emergency that was
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
any realer than this one this is a very
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
severe crisis i'm not
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that uh much taking a
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
property in this
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the rest of the rsa it's
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
fairly limited they even
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
um carved out a special uh exemption in
 
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.710 align:start position:0%
um carved out a special uh exemption in
uh

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph roman 1a for for guns so
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
your guns are protected and then also
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
any personal property owned by
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
individuals or families so it's very
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
restricted anyway
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
also there's the whole issue how how the
 
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.309 align:start position:0%
also there's the whole issue how how the
legislature

00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
would would meet um you know i think
 
00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:02.550 align:start position:0%
would would meet um you know i think
certainly

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
i certainly say back in march or april
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
2020 it would have been impossible for
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
the house to meet i don't think you
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
could have even
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
even if uh speaker shirtless had figured
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
out a place
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
for us to meet in person i don't think
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
he i'm not sure that he would have been
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
able to get a quorum so you know the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing uh
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
you know the whole thing is unworkable
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
i mean what we could do we could have
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
some existing
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee like the joint fiscal
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee or we could set up a new one
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
that would uh
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
do that that would involve a total
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the bill and i
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't know whether the third super
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
majority would be appropriate
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
then too the whole thing is um i don't
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
think it's unworkable and we never did
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
any evidence that any property was uh
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
taken pursuant to that so like i
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any examples really
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
examples of it i mean we did uh
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
we have certainly entered the rental
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
agreement for property the governor uh
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
and half a million dollars running the
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
phony centers bars and oh
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
for stomach republican center we spent
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
some amount of money
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh running facilities from unh more
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
recently from the llc that don't
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
see after sports flex in bedford but
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a taking of property either
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
we were just uh
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
borrowed somebody else's property for
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
for a limited period of time so i just
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
this whole bill
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
this thing is uh this thing is totally
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
unworkable so i certainly think it ought
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
to pass it's definitely the wrong
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
way to go so that's uh that's what i
 
00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:24.150 align:start position:0%
way to go so that's uh that's what i
think

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sylvia
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh first of all
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that this is not uh
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
targeted at
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh our governor either presently or
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the future this is uh targeted
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
at protecting the rights that
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
our citizens have and i'll just note
 
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.630 align:start position:0%
our citizens have and i'll just note
that

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
this statute was not in existence before
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
2002 and this uh
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
wonderful state of ours survived quite
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
nicely through
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
many a catastrophe and i think we will
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
continue with this in place
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative burch
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick note that i forgot to
 
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick note that i forgot to
mention

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
i noticed there's no fiscal note here
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm curious because i suspect if a
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
special session
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
is called
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
that there's considerable expense
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
involved i don't know what the cost of
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
us going over to
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh a sports stadium is
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the transportation cost for all the
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh the publication that the public can
 
00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh the publication that the public can
attend

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
attend
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh or listen uh but i'm sure it comes
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
statutory amount and uh i am loaf
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
to spend money uh the public uh for
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
something that appears so unnecessary
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
but uh can there be a uh request for a
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess we have we have to vote on
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
the pending motion first
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
before we decide whether or not we
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
so this piece of the statue as far as we
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
know has not been used in the whole time
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
18 years that it's been in place
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh the calling of a special
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
session once every 20 years uh that
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
maybe even once every 100 years that's
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure representative sylvia we
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
characterize each other's arguments as
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative morgan okay i i apologize
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
if i said anything ridiculous some
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
but i hypothetically mentioned the
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
german fiscal committee that committee
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
actually did continue
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
meeting um throughout pandemic but
 
00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.589 align:start position:0%
meeting um throughout pandemic but
ironically

00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
ironically
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the cares act funding
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
the extra 1.25 billion of
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
mana that president trump dropped on us
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
um that was actually
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
all spent by the governor set up his own
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh committee dues he actually bypassed
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
that committee so there's
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that um there's and there's probably
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh so there's no guarantee that a future
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
governor won't find some loophole to
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
like uh do what he has to do without the
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
center for two-thirds of the senate in
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
and certainly i mean as it was uh
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
some property was used but uh i know
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
somebody the grappone center i mentioned
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
to my contract that was
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
rented basically at market rates at a
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
fairly generous rate i'm sure
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
for unh and the llc that owns new
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire sports flex were also
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
compensated for are using their property
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that would fall under this anyway
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
so thanks you ready to vote
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
yes no one else with their hand raised
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
will take a vote on the motion which is
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
pending which is ought to pass
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 402 the act rather than
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
taking some property to declare an
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%

another 11 in the affirmative 10 in the
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
negative being 11 to 10
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
mr i will do a minority report
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative burch will do a and would
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
that be
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
in exceeding the legislation uh correct
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
mr sharon if i may yes
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
i just want to make an apology to
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative burch for my
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
characterization of his argument and i'm
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
sure that would not have happened if i
 
00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:24.230 align:start position:0%
sure that would not have happened if i
were

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
apology not needed uh but accepted and
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh i'll
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
the next bill is house bill 418 an act
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think i would make a motion to retain
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know i'll second that i guess that's
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative mclean my
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
my concern i i
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
i fully understand the need to
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh modernize the reporting process
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
but when i heard the testimony from the
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
court i i
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
grew concerned with regard to
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the timing uh the manner in which it was
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to be done
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there would be some
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
type of continuing written record
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
as a backup and so for that reason
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
i think i could have some time to flesh
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
that out if that was possible
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
without making a decision today
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
seeing them i guess we call the role
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
this will be on a motion to retain
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
household 418.
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 418 next bill
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
is house bill 440.
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is jaren uh i have an amendment to
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh hb440 i'd like to move forward to
 
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.789 align:start position:0%
uh hb440 i'd like to move forward to
pass

00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
an amendment so you're moving on to pass
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes so this started out as religious
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
liberties and
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment zero four
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
eight six h uh changes this to
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
civil liberties and the
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
basics of this is that this will provide
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
under a state of emergency and only
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
under a state of emergency
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to uh put forward
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional arguments for the
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
are we addressing your amendment at this
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
point in time is that
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
is that inclusive of your amendment as
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's proposed
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
that is the amendment yes and what is
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.839 --> 00:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
0.6048

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chairman um so i'm
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
speaking against uh this amendment
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
i believe the amendment would uh open up
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
a can of worms that could be a pretty
 
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
a can of worms that could be a pretty
dangerous

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
um precedent in the future um it's
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
reactionary uh to the current emergency
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
i think the way that civil liberties are
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill will open up
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
probable possibilities of confusion and
 
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.990 align:start position:0%
probable possibilities of confusion and
litigation

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
to have to decide if a governor is
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
stepping on civil liberties
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic the governor needs to
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
make calls
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
for the bit of granite staters this
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
amendment speaks frequently to covert 19
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
so i will state that the mass
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
mandates and not allowing people to
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
congregate and other choices were backed
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
by science
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
they true enough may be inconvenient but
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
they were not unconstitutional the
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh decided the orders were
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional um so to conclude
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
i do think this amendment uh is not
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
needed and i do not believe
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
believes civil liberties have been
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
ignored i think we can all think of
 
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.789 align:start position:0%
ignored i think we can all think of
caveats

00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
caveats
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
where we know our rights and civil
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
liberties are not being stepped on
 
00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
liberties are not being stepped on
despite

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
despite
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
claims uh such as not being able to yell
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
bomb on a plane or fire in a movie
 
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.270 align:start position:0%
bomb on a plane or fire in a movie
theater

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
theater
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
i believe wearing a mask during a
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the other orders that we
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
saw follow the same type of logic
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
as these caveats so for these reasons
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
and to simply put it that the amendment
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh is not needed i urge to vote it down
 
00:58:16.079 --> 00:58:17.109 align:start position:0%
uh is not needed i urge to vote it down
um

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
so we can take up the bill thank you
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative alexander um
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i while i appreciate my uh
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
friend from durham's um i think he said
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
logic and science very frequently i just
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
think we're heading
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
too far to the point where science and
 
00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
too far to the point where science and
logic

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
logic
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
is determining um which rights can be
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
trampled on and which ones cannot and
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
that really really really concerns me
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is much needed and i think
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
covent 19 was a clear example
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
of how how far we can stretch these
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
rights and i just think that
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
um you know religious liberty it's in
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
the first amendment for a reason because
 
00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:57.829 align:start position:0%
the first amendment for a reason because
it

00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
should be one of your actually it should
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
be the first uh
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
right that's protected under the law so
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
we need to pass this amendment we need
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill thank you
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
pretend mclean uh thank you mr cheer i
 
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
pretend mclean uh thank you mr cheer i
think

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is uh needed legislation
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
and even though the findings talk a lot
 
00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
and even though the findings talk a lot
about

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
the the current crisis in copen 19 i
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
think this legislation
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that and my best friend
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
who is the best man at my wedding and is
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know like a brother to me to this
 
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.589 align:start position:0%
you know like a brother to me to this
day

00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
is a japanese canadian i practically
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
grew up
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
in his home with his mother telling me
 
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.470 align:start position:0%
in his home with his mother telling me
about

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
how she was interred during the second
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
world war
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
and during that time her property was
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
taken her money was taken
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
her freedom was taken and her dignity
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
was taken
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
and were the people that did this
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily evil
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think so but there is no dispute
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
that an evil was done upon her and you
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
know in spite of that
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
um she she learned to forgive and she
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
went to her brain
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
loving her country um but again
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
what are the things everybody in this
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
room is a leader
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
of a sort and so when a crisis presents
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
itself to people in leadership
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is natural whether we're the governor
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
or the people in this room
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we would want to throw ourselves
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
into the breach
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
and sometimes trying to do that we can
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
go too far
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
not being evil we can nevertheless
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
commit evil
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
what stops us from doing that what stops
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
us from doing that
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
is the law and this is
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
an excellent piece of legislation that i
 
01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.309 align:start position:0%
an excellent piece of legislation that i
think

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies that it goes far beyond the
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
the current pandemic and i'm going to
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%

chair i
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
i voted for the amendment
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
um because i believe that the amendment
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
um was far
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
preferable to the underlying bill
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
and if in the fullness of time
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
this committee were to decide to go
 
01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:30.549 align:start position:0%
this committee were to decide to go
ahead

01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
with 440 i wanted it to be
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
the text of my colleagues representative
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that um
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
the the bill as amended
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
is not um helpful
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
in any way in any significant way
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
to protect the civil liberties of
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
the citizens of this state
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
um i heard representative mclean's
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
moving uh testimony
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
and i too had friends whose families
 
01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:15.270 align:start position:0%
and i too had friends whose families
were

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
interred and their civil liberties
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
violated i have friends who today
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
have their civil liberties and their
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
civil rights violated
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
under under existing law
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
but so the problem is certainly a real
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
problem but i do not believe
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
in fact does anything in any broad way
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
to better protect the civil rights and
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
civil liberties of the people
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
of this state and therefore my intention
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
is to vote
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
representative mcbeth um
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
i voted for the amendment as well i'm
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
wondering if my colleagues would
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
vote against the ought to pass as
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
amended and vote to retain it
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
now that it's been changed a little and
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
work on it more um and the fullness of
 
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
work on it more um and the fullness of
time

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know come up with something that um
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
would be supported more broadly
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you well the motion is pending is
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
not to pass as amended at this point if
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
that fails
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%

sir representative mclean i'm following
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
you representative to retain that bill
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
and do you want to address that at all
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
having litchfield is part of my
 
01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
having litchfield is part of my
constituency

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
constituency
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
i'm very well aware of the p-pass
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
situation and i'm very sympathetic to it
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
i have gone through and amended two fast
 
01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:25.829 align:start position:0%
i have gone through and amended two fast
bills

01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
um in prior executive sessions but this
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
one i just think
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
is too complex for an easy amendment
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm still not certain does this actually
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
just belong in the courts
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
um that we heard a lot of testimony
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
about the coakley landfill
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
and as being a kind of the precedent but
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
i really don't
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
think we want to get into a place where
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
the default avenue is always to come to
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a lot of work to be
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
done before we could go
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
seeing them we have a motion to retain

01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
also includes
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
the virginian 542 talking about
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the treatment of religious organizations
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
and emergencies
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they can't be treated any worse
 
01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:11.910 align:start position:0%
that they can't be treated any worse
than

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
other similar types of organizations and
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's an important thing to
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
codify all this
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
because as we looked towards their
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
decisions with something to change
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
with no notice of very little notice and
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
the statute would be a strong
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
encouragement for them to continue
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
thinking the long lines they are
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
protecting our community
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
other discussion actually we're talking
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
about the amendment right now
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
623 h which is
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
senator smith uh yes thank you very much
 
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
senator smith uh yes thank you very much
um

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills where we're
 
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.950 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills where we're
treading

01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
treading
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
on eggshells and i understand that
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it is very important
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
in honoring our constitution
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
and our bill of rights to recognize
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody questions that
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
what i have a problem with um
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion
 
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.510 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion
stops

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
interferes with
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
when is that um
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
is it because some people believe in
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
in in in buddha some people
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the absolute
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
new testament but not necessarily the
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
literal reading of the old testament for
 
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.149 align:start position:0%
literal reading of the old testament for
example

01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
no no no no no everybody is entitled
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
to those thoughts and to those beliefs
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
and to practice them in any way they
 
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.709 align:start position:0%
and to practice them in any way they
want

01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
is by practicing their religion in a
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
particular way
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
interfere for example with my right
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
there have to be some
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
ways of recognizing both
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have had example after example
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
of what has happened when in
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
defiance of
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
religious bodies have come together
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
in great concentration
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the exact number and
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to misspeak
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
but there was not too many months ago
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
a wedding in um
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
in brooklyn where there were
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
thousands upon thousands
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
of observers religious
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
observers packed together
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
um in uh
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
in celebrating that that marriage
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
the result of that was an enormous
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
spike in um
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
in covid and that affected the health of
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
those people who were there and the
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
health of those people
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
who weren't there but had the misfortune
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
to come into contact with people who
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
showed great disdain for the rights of
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
others to protect
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
themselves the same thing happened in
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
northern maine the same things happened
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
and um in
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
all the testimony the testimony that
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it was for this particular
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill that struck me
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh the most was the testimony about
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
um people who used the church facilities
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
um because they were participating in
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
the 12-step programs and i forget
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
found that testimony to be very moving
 
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
found that testimony to be very moving
and

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
realized i know how i feel being in
 
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.750 align:start position:0%
realized i know how i feel being in
isolation

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
and if i needed the support of others
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
in order to survive
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important i think
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
this bill goes too far to say
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
that um the only thing that matters
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
is that people should do whatever
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
could do whatever they want to do in
 
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.270 align:start position:0%
could do whatever they want to do in
practicing

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
their religion even if it's so doing
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
it damages the life and the health of
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
other people so
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's not easy it's not an easy decision
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
but to single out religious gatherings
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
as um to be protected from what is
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
viewed as discriminatory treatment
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
to put that above those 12-step programs
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
that might not be housed
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
in um in a religious setting
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
but in another common setting i think
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
is to upset the delicate balance that we
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
have been able to maintain in this
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
country for about
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
250 years so i know
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's my position is not a popular
 
01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:01.189 align:start position:0%
that's my position is not a popular
position

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
but i believe that it is a position
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
that honors and respects the rights of
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
everyone to practice his or her religion
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
as they choose
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
but does not give them the right
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
to put others in harm's way
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah representative clinton
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative mclean oh yeah thank you
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
mr chair and
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i think that the
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion as the prime sponsor
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
said it
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
is kind of foundational but i found the
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the aclu
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually very enlightening that they
 
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
actually very enlightening that they
didn't

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
speak at the public hearing but they
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
sent in written testimony
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
and in that written testimony they said
 
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
and in that written testimony they said
that

01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
the the practice to exercise your
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
religion is not free
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
of all restrictions and i think that one
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
strengths of this amended bill is that
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
it recognizes the ability of the state
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
to place neutral restrictions
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so in many ways the the amended
 
01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.149 align:start position:0%
and so in many ways the the amended
language

01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
believe it or not kind of dovetails in
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the um the aclu's written testimony
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
well i think the reason that this bill
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
is because while it does preserve the
 
01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.470 align:start position:0%
is because while it does preserve the
right

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
of this ability to put neutral
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on religion
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
the actual testimony that we heard in
 
01:27:35.199 --> 01:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
the actual testimony that we heard in
committee

01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
was that the practice of religion
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
was actually inferior and and was
 
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
was actually inferior and and was
subordinate

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
subordinate
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
it was it was not treated in the same
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
way as other emergency services for
 
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
way as other emergency services for
example

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and i know from my own personal
 
01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.990 align:start position:0%
um and i know from my own personal
experience

01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
that it was much easier for me to go
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
down to home depot
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
to look at vanities for my
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
renovation of my home long before i was
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
able to get into church to receive the
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
blessed sacrament so
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
there was there was a definite
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
difference there
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i think the argument being made
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
by the folks during the public hearing
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
was hey
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
we will comply with these neutral
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions but the reality is that we
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
were held
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
closed long after many other places were
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
opened up
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
and there was not a recognition of our
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
very important role in the community so
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think all they were asking for is
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
parity i think that this
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill grants that and i'm going to
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
support it
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative yes yeah so i i think
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that my steve carley has misread the
 
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:51.910 align:start position:0%
that my steve carley has misread the
bill

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
misread the amendment the amendment
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
institutes the same standard
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the compelling interest standard for the
 
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.149 align:start position:0%
the compelling interest standard for the
state

01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
this has been long recognized as the
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
standard for infringement
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the right to practice your faith
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
and in addition in emergency
 
01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
and in addition in emergency
circumstances

01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
and simply such a religious organization
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency the state
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
government shall permit
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
a religious organization to continue
 
01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
a religious organization to continue
operating

01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
and to engage in religious services to
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
or greater extent that other
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
organizations or businesses
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
that provide essential services that's
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
all it says
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
if they're going to allow other
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
essential services
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
that they consider religion to be in a
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
sense of service and
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
operate under the same or maybe
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
booster if they so desire but
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
so in my private life i'm a christian
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
pastor and so i just want to say that i
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
know firsthand how difficult and
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking it's been for religious
 
01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking it's been for religious
communities

01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
not to be able to gather during covid um
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
but there were lots of good reasons that
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
these were treated differently than
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
for singing purposes for one um but
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
there were others as well and i think
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
the guidelines were
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
were taxing i won't i won't lie but they
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
made a way
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
for creative solutions for how how
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
religious communities could come
 
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
religious communities could come
together

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i saw a lot of that from myself and
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
where communities could come together
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
creatively and
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
safely within the bounds of the public
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
health protocols
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
i guess i really feel that the freedom
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
to exercise religion is enshrined in the
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
constitution and that that's not going
 
01:30:59.199 --> 01:31:00.310 align:start position:0%
constitution and that that's not going
anywhere

01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
but in the case of these extreme
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
emergencies like the one we're facing
 
01:31:03.679 --> 01:31:04.950 align:start position:0%
emergencies like the one we're facing
now

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
the health of the community behind
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
beyond the walls of our houses of
 
01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
beyond the walls of our houses of
worship

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
worship
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
is really as important as the spiritual
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
care that's provided inside
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't really believe that we need a
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
new law that prioritizes religious
 
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.189 align:start position:0%
new law that prioritizes religious
freedoms

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
freedoms
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
over public health and safety in a
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
crisis i'm going to have to vote against
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill
 
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.629 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the bill
representative

01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you very much mr chair um
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
the uh bill's amendment still doesn't
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
have a definition of
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
of a religion and that's something
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's probably impossible uh possible
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
to define i remember uh
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
i remember once i was driving to the
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
state house i was listening to a uh
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
spiritual leader it doesn't matter who
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
was of the myth of the creator god so
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
excited about how ridiculous it was the
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
idea of the university of university as
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
a creator and i'm
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
not sure where the university has i
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much accept the universe as it is
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
so like whether someone created it or
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
not is
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of not a big issue for me
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
personally but then i
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
get it it was like a one o'clock access
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
in the state house and get there the
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
first thing uh reverend kate
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
haskins the former uh pastor former uh
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
house chaplain who i believe she's still
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
the pastor of the church that's right
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
across the street from the state house
 
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:17.910 align:start position:0%
across the street from the state house
and

01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
she said mindy does she started saying
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
many beliefs
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
one thing we have we all have in common
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
is the idea that there is a creator i'm
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
almost like
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
oh i almost had to suppress my laughter
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
there just because i've been hearing
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
someone who describes those religious
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
leaders saying exactly the opposite that
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
no creator anyway so i'm not sure how we
 
01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.550 align:start position:0%
no creator anyway so i'm not sure how we
can

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate religious groups from from
 
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
differentiate religious groups from from
from

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
from other groups so we certainly are
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation where it's
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous to have mass
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
gatherings of any type we're
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
still in the situation where it's
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous and i think um
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
i know it's difficult for church it's
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
just difficult for probably all sorts of
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um but um i think
 
01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.870 align:start position:0%
organizations um but um i think
sometimes

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
situations prop up like the one we're in
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
now where
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh we have to have certain uh certain
 
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
uh we have to have certain uh certain
restrictions

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that doesn't apply to
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that call themselves
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
religious just suppose
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
those who don't and also there's people
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the 12-step programs um
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're spiritual i think they
 
01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.270 align:start position:0%
they're they're spiritual i think they
specifically

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
claim not to be a religion per se even
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
though they require certain even though
 
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.629 align:start position:0%
though they require certain even though
they

01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
do at least expect people to open the
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
idea that there is a god and so forth so
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
i just think this is an overly broad
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
thing it it's open to like incredible
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of abuse and
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
in any case uh i think virtually all the
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
many religious and spiritual
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
organizations they found a way to keep
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
meeting i know like uh the
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
catholic church i was brought up in they
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
even had to hold their easter
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
services and zoom and i have to confess
 
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:51.430 align:start position:0%
services and zoom and i have to confess
i'm

01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
describing myself as christian in my
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
blue book entertainment that's got my
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
blue book this morning but um
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not one of the people who goes to
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
church very often maybe that's
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably not a good thing but i did go
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
to a funeral service and we had it uh
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
we had it outdoors the minister uh
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
minister had us all stand six feet apart
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the seventh term cemetery we had mass
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
on and they
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
zoomed it so they were able to hold a
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
funeral service in you know full
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
all the emergency order requirements and
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
then some so you know it is uh
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's certainly possible for religious
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
groups to keep meeting
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh during an emergency as indeed they
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
during this emergency so i probably said
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
way too much but anyway i
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
plan to vote against this amendment and
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%

01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%

um mr chair could i ask a question
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you don't have to answer
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
it of course
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
um but i need some clarification i'm
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of the two two bills we've
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
acted on
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
440 as amendment
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
amended by our distinguished colleague
 
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.270 align:start position:0%
amended by our distinguished colleague
representative

01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
sylvia and
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused about how they are
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
the same and how they're
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
different i mean each has had a
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
significant amendment
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
i thought they were combined am i
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
can you give me a tutorial having
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with voting just
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
explaining the substance of the two
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
bills to me
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to rely on each
 
01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to rely on each
individual

01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for anyone else who may
 
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.070 align:start position:0%
have voted so
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
have voted so

[Music]
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
well would representative sylvia or
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative walper helped me out
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
sure i'll i'll speak to uh 440 it
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh it
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
is related to general civil liberties
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the last one which is more
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
specific to
religious

01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
liberties so i think there's certainly a
 
01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:51.340 align:start position:0%
difference there
 
01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.350 align:start position:0%
difference there

01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment o623 we just adopted it to
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
542 did incorporate
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of the original house bill
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%

01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
is it been maybe a better word by the
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the mac decision in december so
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
he introduced the amendment that
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
represented silvia brought to us
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
to expand the
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
focus of to expand the whole idea
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
of protection of civil liberties without
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
but uh others
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
thought it was very important
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we not solely rely
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
on the supreme court decision to
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
protect our religious freedom
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
and important that we clarify that
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
religious freedom should be at least on
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
the same playing field
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
as all of our other civil liberties so
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
we had five 440 as amended that dealt
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
broadly with civil liberties and
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was brought into 542
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
more much more clearly focused on
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
religious liberty and the importance of
 
01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
religious liberty and the importance of
it

01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
getting at least equal treatment with
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative welker that was
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
i was thinking that perhaps people would
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
like to take a break
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes so it's
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's about quarter of 11 so why don't we
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
plan to come back
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
that reconvene at 11 o'clock recess
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.760 --> 01:44:04.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.840 --> 01:56:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
i still can't use the oven but at least
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
i can cook on top of the stove and that
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay household 515.
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
all right so we are now unneeded guys
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know what's another good committee
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
for discussions
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
is the science and technology all right
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
they have some very good deficits oh do
 
01:57:08.239 --> 01:57:08.870 align:start position:0%
they have some very good deficits oh do
they

01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
i wish they could have one or two people
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that committee to talk to people
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
because every one of me gets on
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
start talking about the details of these
 
01:57:28.239 --> 01:57:29.990 align:start position:0%
start talking about the details of these
things

01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think they're getting better at it i
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
think you guys are broadcasting alive
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah you guys are not muted and we do
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you we're just complimenting our
 
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:50.830 align:start position:0%
thank you we're just complimenting our
colleagues

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
see this is one of the problems of doing
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
this the way we're doing it
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
when we're not in session we're still on
 
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.870 align:start position:0%
when we're not in session we're still on
my

01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
right it's just really not that hard to
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
well that happened in the old days
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
people would say stuff when we're
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the room and other people would hear
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
it anyway so that's nothing new now just
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a recording of it unless we mute
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
the microphone into the room so but
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't mind taking compliments so
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're welcome it reminds me
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
having grown up on a farm in illinois
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
of the old party lines yes
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
you'd be talking in their beats
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't really had a belmont but it was
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
they got the phone and people would
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
already be talking well there wouldn't
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
be anybody talking and keep staring and
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
then they just
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
pick it up and lose travels fast
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
i remember that as a kid my grandmother
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
was one of the
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
original operators in um
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
well actually new report mass the
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
switchboard operator so yeah we would
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
hear a lot
 
01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:15.189 align:start position:0%
hear a lot
[Laughter]

01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
nice not to have to share that party
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're democrats we don't do no stinking
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
party lines
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
our next bill to africon today is house
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
bill 550 an act relative to the
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent during the state of
 
01:59:55.040 --> 02:00:02.310 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent during the state of
imprisonment

02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i would move
 
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:13.700 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on hb 550.
 
02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on hb 550.
[Music]

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:18.730 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
first of all i don't know that this bill
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
is entirely necessary with
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
all the relief that is already going on
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps by the time that this might
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
make it through the process it would be
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
entirely unnecessary
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
but beyond that um when we talk about
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
adding costs on to uh
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
landlords that ends up in one place and
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
rents and it pushes up
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
rents for those who are paying and
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
we already know that we have a
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous problem with
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh with folks finding affordable housing
 
02:01:04.159 --> 02:01:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh with folks finding affordable housing
and

02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
this would damage it and make it even
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
more difficult so
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to proceed with
 
02:01:14.070 --> 02:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
this bill other than
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative page yes thank you mr
 
02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:20.950 align:start position:0%
representative page yes thank you mr
chair

02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
um i speak uh in opposition of the itl
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
would motion for ought to pass the bill
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
i want
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
very briefly um this bill is not just
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
about um
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
helping the housing and security issue
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
but it's economic you know
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's economically efficient it provides
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
a way for courts to quickly dispose
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
first to continue a case and then
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps dispose of it
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
um quickly if if someone's applying for
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
rental assistance
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
i think to the point on relief it's
 
02:01:51.599 --> 02:01:52.149 align:start position:0%
i think to the point on relief it's
perhaps

02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
more salient and now
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
than it was when we first heard
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on it because of
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
additional coveted relief i think
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's somewhere in the north
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
range of 22 billion and rental
 
02:02:05.679 --> 02:02:06.870 align:start position:0%
range of 22 billion and rental
assistance

02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the latest covert relief package which i
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
assume the
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
sign and that would be helping folks
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
this statute only helps utilization of
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
that money
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i would support
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
what to pass
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.030 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo thank you mr
claire

02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
claire
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think what we need to really focus on
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
is that this bill
 
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
does only one thing it provides a 30-day
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
extension for non-payment
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
of rent cases
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
that have been entered into the court it
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it only applies
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic just
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago the governor's
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
office um
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
is in the process of releasing funds to
 
02:03:10.639 --> 02:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
is in the process of releasing funds to
assist

02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
assist
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants with delinquent
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
rent payments
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
this is money from the gopher
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
money that was previously allocated
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
the money will be administered by the
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing finance authority
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
and it will be distributed by the cap
 
02:03:31.119 --> 02:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
and it will be distributed by the cap
agencies

02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
now what's great about this these gofar
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
funds is that um
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the payments will go directly to the
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
landlords so
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
i see this as a win-win for landlords
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you mr
 
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
representative alexander um thank you mr
chair

02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
um the money that's coming from
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the gopher funding is already
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
something that's being
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
um given to our landlord and tenants and
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
has really
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
not a lot a whole lot to do with this
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill um
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
i think the housing there is a
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
significant housing crisis
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
but again i think the issue is with
 
02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
but again i think the issue is with
supply

02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
supply
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
more regulation we put on landlords and
 
02:04:12.239 --> 02:04:13.270 align:start position:0%
more regulation we put on landlords and
tenants

02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
the more it's going to exacerbate this
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
crisis this bill needs to be
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion this is on house
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
see none we do have a motion pending
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
so you know further discussions would
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%

and would you like to speak to that
representative

02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um this is a
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
rather simple
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
um proposal
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
to help
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
i think it'll help our supervisors of
 
02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:23.030 align:start position:0%
i think it'll help our supervisors of
checklists

02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
checklists
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
to purge some old data
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
simply uh cleaning up uh
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the voter rolls if people move and
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh re-register or
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know there have been occasions where
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
people were
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
registered in two places and uh
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
inadvertently forgot about it and
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh ended up voting in two places so we
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
could help
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
avoid those sorts of situations i think
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so i'm speaking
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
against the recommendation
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
this bill on the surface i was actually
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the hearing because i
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
was curious
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
what problem it would be solving why
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
this list
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
was necessary who was excused from jury
 
02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:20.830 align:start position:0%
was necessary who was excused from jury
service

02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
but the first words out of the sponsor's
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
mouth was this bill is about voter
 
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
mouth was this bill is about voter
integrity

02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh he referred to it as a small tool
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
that could be used for
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh tracking potential fraud um
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
and and i'll
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
i i just think that it's it's in the
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
wrong committee and and i believe there
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
was a back and forth conversation
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
um between two members where it was
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
questioned why if this is the intent it
 
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.270 align:start position:0%
questioned why if this is the intent it
was

02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
would not go to election um and the
 
02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
would not go to election um and the
response

02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
um was well how would you how would you
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
tell it to go to
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
election law and i think that's a very
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
fair point and i i think if it's not
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the proper uh committee because the
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
intent is that not clear
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's not ready to pass um that aside
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
based off the merits and the senate said
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
intent i do not believe
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor introduced to us an
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
actual problem that we have
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so for that reason i am
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
speaking against this recommendation
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
um and would offer itl thank you
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um thank you
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
very much mr joe i can uh beat my muted
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
for once
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair i agree you
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
had the sponsor he described it as voter
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
integrity but i would use a different
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
noun after
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
voter hyphen so first of all uh
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
jury duty jury lists are compiled not
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
just from the
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
voter rolls from from other places in
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
fact one of the reasons why people are
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
reluctant to vote
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
um is because they're afraid to be
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
called for jury duties and so these
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
things uh shouldn't be coupled together
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
there are other sources that the court
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
used just to compile a list of uh
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
citizens who live in the county also um
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't even do what it
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
intends to do because it simply says
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to publish a list on the
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's website
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
which even those recently upgraded is
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
not the most user-friendly website but
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
anybody any power to do anything uh with
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
that list
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so like it doesn't authorize the
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
supervisor supervises the checklist
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that says they have to
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
look at the list i'm not even sure if
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
they'd be authorized to hurt somebody
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
from it just based on that list so
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's another problem so aside from the
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
fact that i disagree with
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
what it does in principle we also need
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain the confidentiality of the
 
02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
to maintain the confidentiality of the
juror

02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
juror
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the jurors and also it just doesn't
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
do what it sets out to do
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
so there's three good reasons right
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
if not we have a motion about to pass on
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%

amended and offer
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
it was that zero four two five h yes
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
and is there a second second to that
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
would you like to address your motion
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
um sure so um there were some concerns i
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
had with this bill
 
02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
last year when was presented by the
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor however i believe the sponsors
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
addressed those concerns with the bill
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
filed this year
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would require regular review
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
of sealed minutes of non-public sessions
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
by making them public after one year and
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
if the circumstances around these
 
02:13:43.679 --> 02:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
if the circumstances around these
minutes

02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
have changed then the local board can
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
after review release those minutes
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
um if the board chooses to keep these
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
minutes sealed they're allowed to keep
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
them sealed with a two-thirds vote
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
vote um the amendment that i have moved
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
addresses concerns by the municipal
 
02:13:58.159 --> 02:13:59.030 align:start position:0%
addresses concerns by the municipal
association

02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
and also has the support of right to
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire um i think this is a
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
great bill that will allow for more
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
transparency in our government and i
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to vote for
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the bill thanks or any
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative oregon um yes well i
 
02:14:16.719 --> 02:14:17.830 align:start position:0%
yes representative oregon um yes well i
i

02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
i would i would have offered a uh motion
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
for itl and if
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
if this fails i will offer one so i
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
think this is a
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
first of all it cut it makes a special
 
02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.069 align:start position:0%
first of all it cut it makes a special
uh

02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:32.550 --> 02:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
provision for um the language about
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
subparagraph 2d that's the real estate
 
02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:35.189 align:start position:0%
subparagraph 2d that's the real estate
transaction

02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
so it covers the same ground as 232. so
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm up opposed to it
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
special treatment of that one for the
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
same reason uh i'll be
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
i've closed it hb 232 also think uh just
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
a basic idea of
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
fortune to public bodies to vote on the
 
02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
fortune to public bodies to vote on the
uh

02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
vote on the minutes of all the sealed
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
minutes going back to however long back
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
to like
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
any of time i think that's uh that's an
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden they would
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could theoretically
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
be spending their whole time just
 
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
be spending their whole time just
constantly

02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
voting at every meeting on uh
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the old unsealed record so that just
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
seems uh
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
seems like a waste of time although
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
they'll probably work around it by
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
writing the rules so they'll just have a
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
consent calendar of the
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
minutes or something so i think uh i
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
i just don't think there's any need for
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
it and uh and there already
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
is disclosure of like which minutes have
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
been sealed so like
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's really really concerned they
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
can go back to it and
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
ask for the unsealed i'm not sure about
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
where the minutes are sealed they're
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
like not of much lasting interest anyway
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you to
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment but against
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
the uh underlying bill and then um
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
move on to an itl so thanks
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the motion independent uh actually
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
what's pending right now is an amendment
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
offered by representative alexander to
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 566.
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's no further discussion on that
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'll pass the clerk
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
on amendment 04258 on accepting
 
02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
on amendment 04258 on accepting
amendment

02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%

now mr chairman yes i have an auditing

affirmative time in the negative
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we've adopted the recommendation
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
about to pass as amended
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh and president morgan are you doing a
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
minority report
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
um um yes does your preference be that i
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
attack the
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
i it'll be brief in either case but
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
should i be arguing against the otpa or
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill although i suppose the
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
same arguments apply to both
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
i think you'd be arguing itl okay thank
 
02:19:19.439 --> 02:19:25.030 align:start position:0%
i think you'd be arguing itl okay thank
you

02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
578 and act relative to standards for
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i think i would make a motion of
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
itl on that particular
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason the reason i have what i
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
frankly my understanding was that this
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
came out of a study committee
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the study committee basically said
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
there ought to be statements for mental
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
health courts
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
and that their the mental health courts
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
are being conducted by the courts right
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
now and the way they've
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
got that consistent manner
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
that they're applying different
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
standards in different courts
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so what the bill does
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
directs the chief justice of the supreme
 
02:20:22.399 --> 02:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
directs the chief justice of the supreme
court

02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
to do a report with regard to adopting
 
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:28.630 align:start position:0%
to do a report with regard to adopting
standards

02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i guess i have two issues with that
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
the first issue is i
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's up to the legislature
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
to tell another branch of government
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
in this particular case the chief
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
justice of the supreme court
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
that they need to do a report and i
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
guess the second
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
part that i have of that since
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
we've already adopted provisions in our
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
constitution which it
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to adopt rules that have
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the full force and effect of law
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason in the world that the
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
court can't do that
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
on its own accord so
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
i just i think the bill is is
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary i and i and
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
and frankly in terms of ordering the
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
chief justice to do something
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's appropriate so that's
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
why i would make the recommendation in
 
02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
why i would make the recommendation in
expedient

02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
with with hesitancy i want to speak to
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
the other side of
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
what you just addressed uh i was part of
 
02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
what you just addressed uh i was part of
the

02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
the commission that looked into this
 
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
the commission that looked into this
issue

02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
trying to establish uh federal health
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
courts statewide which we have not been
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
able to do so far
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
unlike drug courts where there are
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
national standards
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are not national standards for
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
so not having national standards
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and having different issues that
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
mental health courts would have in more
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
rural areas in terms of
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
for instance accessibility to judges
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
and transportation all those other kind
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
of things
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
are very different in uh rural courts
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
than in more urban courts um
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
it was the sense of the
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
committee or the commission of the a ton
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
of various stakeholders
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
the top of the food game as far as
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
mental health courts go
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh should be the one to devise a system
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
that will work
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um the uh
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
this proposal has not been objected to
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court the supreme court
 
02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court the supreme court
is

02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
very able to send a
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
spokesperson over to our committee and
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
say that they felt this would be
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriate they had did not do so
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
in fact as i recall judge nadeau of the
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh came in and testified in favor of
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
so in the absence of objection from the
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
on uh the technicality that our chair
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
has brought forward
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
um we need to move it forward the most
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
efficient and best way to move this
 
02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
efficient and best way to move this
forward

02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh according to the stakeholders a very
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
broad base
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders uh was this
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
proposal most came in here
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
with support one after the next after
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the next after the next
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that this committee
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
would support moving the
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
um and with all due respect of

02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
which i um
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
greatly um defer to but
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
i really i feel like this bill um
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
um being a breach of the three
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
branches of government and the
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
allocation of power is really um
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
just authorizing an internal audit of
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
um which would help them coordinate
 
02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
their services
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i i think that now we know covet has
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
been a
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
pan you know a health crisis but from
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
that has from
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
a mental health crisis and i feel that
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
timely issue because
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
this audit will give us you know current
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
information on the demand and need
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
of resources for this court um so i
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
asked um
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
i asked my colleagues and the chair to
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
consider that and
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
if this amendment could be withdrawn and
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
we could consider um
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
any other discussion yes
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
so we just recently had instituted drug
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
courts across
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the state and it seems to me that the
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
mental health courts are following the
 
02:25:31.439 --> 02:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
mental health courts are following the
path

02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
path
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
to drug courts followed and that was
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
first you can try it and
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
you find out what works
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and how it can be implemented and then
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
you come in and say
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
we want to do this across the state and
 
02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
this party was very acceptable
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't see why the mental health
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
support is different in the sense that
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
we never told the judiciary branch
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
how to implement drug forwards we never
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
told them
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
what standards to establish or how they
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
would operate and i don't think we
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up on the comments that
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between the drug
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
courts in the mental health courts and
 
02:26:20.319 --> 02:26:22.550 align:start position:0%
courts in the mental health courts and
that

02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
the drug courts are in the superior
 
02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:26.309 align:start position:0%
the drug courts are in the superior
court

02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
mental health courts are in the circuit
 
02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.150 align:start position:0%
mental health courts are in the circuit
court

02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
and judge the doe testified but judgment
 
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
is in the superior form
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
not in the circuit court where where the
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
mental health courts
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
are and we really didn't hear from
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
the circuit court and i do have concerns
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it gets to your
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh representing macbeth which i
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
think is appropriate and
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
the question is are there resources in
 
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
the question is are there resources in
the

02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you you can adopt standards but are
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
there resources
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court to actually hold
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
mental health because i think it's been
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
the desire of the circuit court for a
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
very long time
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
to expand the mental health court
 
02:27:12.399 --> 02:27:13.590 align:start position:0%
to expand the mental health court
program

02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
but they just don't have the resources
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to
 
02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to
do

02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative burch yes that's true
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
there is a resource problem which is why
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
this was going to come back sooner or
 
02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
this was going to come back sooner or
later

02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the legislature anyway no matter what
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
to answer representative walper's
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
question there already are national
 
02:27:37.359 --> 02:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
question there already are national
standards

02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the mental health world we didn't
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
have to come up
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
candidates adopted nationwide in terms
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
of mental health courts
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me i met earlier say drug courts
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
drug courts have
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
national standards mental health courts
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
do not they do not run on the same model
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
in fact looked into whether it should be
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
one group
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
doing both or whether it should be done
 
02:28:10.399 --> 02:28:11.910 align:start position:0%
doing both or whether it should be done
separately

02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
separately
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the service providing the service theory
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
is different in both cases
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
so again um if
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
it was felt that the supreme court was
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the best place to come up with a
 
02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:28.710 align:start position:0%
in the best place to come up with a
comprehensive

02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
set of standards which would work for
 
02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:34.309 align:start position:0%
set of standards which would work for
the

02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
courts that they supervise and and
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
staff and they can look at the at the
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
places that already have it
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%

i i can i don't know if we had someone

else lined up or not
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
happy to do that i'm happy to do it but
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
have spoken so eloquently and we're on
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
the committee so
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
are on the commission study committee
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
rather so

representative burch i'll defer to you
 
02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
if you all right
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
i understand the problem representative
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
birch that might arise and we'll deal
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%

mr chairman yes when you get to the next
bill

02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill

02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
are you ready for that on 597. this is
 
02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:14.790 align:start position:0%
are you ready for that on 597. this is
an

02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
act relative to the expectation of
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
would you like to make a motion mr chair
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
i would like to move retain
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to do with the
 
02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to do with the
substance

02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
substance
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
since i actually in fact think this is a
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i think the amendment makes it
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
even better it answers all the
 
02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
even better it answers all the
opposition

02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
but i have a feeling mr
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
chair in the back of my mind
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
that if i in fact move retain
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
this might be another opportunity to
 
02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:01.429 align:start position:0%
this might be another opportunity to
show

02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
show
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
how well the judiciary committee works
 
02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
how well the judiciary committee works
together

02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
and on that basis i would like to move
 
02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
and on that basis i would like to move
retain

02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%

02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i moved by uh representative smith
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and seconded by
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%

was
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
thinking that this bill should be
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
entirely killed i would like to move
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%

and this is a
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
fresh amendment um
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
you would have gotten from uh our
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh assistant uh jennifer four this
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
morning at uh i think it was just around
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock we got this through
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
but the amendment is uh 0 7
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
strikes section 1 from the bill
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
which is about the uh 91a and remote
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.469 align:start position:0%
which is about the uh 91a and remote
meetings

02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it leaves intact uh sections two
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
renumbers those two uh one two three
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that leaves uh the signature
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um allowance for that uh particular part
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
so um this is the only way that i could
 
02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:04.230 align:start position:0%
so um this is the only way that i could
uh

02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
find a save half a loaf um and
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
didn't realize this bill would be
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
controversial at all it's a got
 
02:36:28.389 --> 02:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan it's a republican prime
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor and bipartisan and
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
senate support um it's was um
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
offered by many every sponsor
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%

02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee and it
 
02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:41.349 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee and it
seemed

02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
seemed
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
to me just like it was a bill to help
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
our government um
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know process uh rules quicker and
 
02:36:47.359 --> 02:36:48.630 align:start position:0%
you know process uh rules quicker and
faster

02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
faster
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
and representative uh sylvia's amendment
 
02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:51.830 align:start position:0%
and representative uh sylvia's amendment
does

02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
take out a very important part of the
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill to me but in the effort to work
 
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly and to um save half a loaf
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to support um this amendment
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
and um uh
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
have the bill go through as otpa i
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
realize we're just voting on the
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment now but
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
um there's where i am thank you very
 
02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
um there's where i am thank you very
much

02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent horrigan um yes i think the
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
section one is uh the most important
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
half of the load so and uh
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i know i know where it changes the
 
02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
and i know i know where it changes the
way

02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
public bodies have to run their meetings
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
but i think this is something that
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think is i think this is
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
something that's a very good idea it's
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
also been extremely popular public
 
02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
also been extremely popular public
participation

02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
in uh public body meetings of all sorts
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
including legislative committees has
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that's uh generally a good thing
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'll be
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
oh it's totally a good thing i'm not
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to qualify it and um so
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
in any case it's also it's just uh
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so it just
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
says that they may have the
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
remote telephone and video options which
 
02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:03.990 align:start position:0%
remote telephone and video options which
uh

02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
some have been doing for years already
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't anything prohibiting
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
them from doing it before
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that's uh um i mean it does serve
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
it just sort of put the onus on you know
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
chair the members of the public body
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
decide not to have it they will probably
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
the public will now like
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
demand well why aren't you doing it so
 
02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:24.150 align:start position:0%
demand well why aren't you doing it so
like

02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
so when they that's gonna be that's
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
gonna be a problem for public bodies
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
that don't want to do it but
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think uh they shouldn't do it and for
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
the second
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
part that i actually had a little more
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
doubts about that but i think the second
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
part is good but uh i'll
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
definitely vote against the amendment
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%

02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
my comment that before i call upon
 
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
representing chase it's just to say uh
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
we went through a lot of business today
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
we did it very efficiently and
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't agree on everything today but
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
i have to say that the committee did web
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
did his business very respectfully today
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's greatly appreciated everybody's
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
cooperation in doing that
 
02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
and representative chase did you want to
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
have something to say
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i did because i
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
raised my hand but i
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
was hesitant and um you didn't see it
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's fine
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
i i'm glad we're retaining this bill but
 
02:48:02.469 --> 02:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say coming from an
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
another small town although merrimack's
 
02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
not just
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
real small but we have a village water
 
02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
district ourselves
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we have have run into quite a few of
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
instances as um the mvd
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily pfest but just
 
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
having trouble trying to get the state
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
to to um either settle things or just
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
sort of step in and
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
help us so i completely understand what
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
it is they're doing the
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
frustration the um
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
things that were made like the
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
agreements that were made
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
kind of in the closed sessions without
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
letting the people
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
of the village district vote on it which
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
has happened to us as well
 
02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
i know that's part of the procedure it's
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
different than a town
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh but i i really do hope that we can
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
find a solution
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
and help them with this problem because
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think they're
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
they've got the underhanded deal here
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
and really need to try to help with the
 
02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:02.710 align:start position:0%
and really need to try to help with the
water

02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
situation and the the damage that's
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
being done by saint cobain
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
and other places as well i don't want to
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
put all the blame there
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
but i just needed to say that because i
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
felt bad that i didn't
 
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
stick up for for the um
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
what this what's the town's trying to do
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
their village district
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes so so mr chairman do you have any uh
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
idea what this schedule for this
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee will be between now and the
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
time of the f session
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
or you know the the only thing that i
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
know is at some point in time we'll be
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
getting senate bills we don't have any
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
senate bills at this point in time
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm not going to waste people
 
02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:51.349 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm not going to waste people
time

02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
one or two bills you know i'll wait
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
until we get critical mass
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can be efficient in the way
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
we use our time
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
but as soon as we do get critical mass
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
on senate bills i certainly will
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
call the meeting the committee back
 
02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
order again
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman would it be worth our
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
while to do a little work on
 
02:50:12.790 --> 02:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
one or more of the retained bills that
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
we have yeah
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you if the committee would like to
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
work retain bills uh
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
might as i indicated last time what i'd
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
like to do on the retain bills
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
is if in fact there are bills in which
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are people who would like to form
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
a committee i would be more than happy
 
02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:35.269 align:start position:0%
a committee i would be more than happy
to

02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
appoint that and have them work on those
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
if they're if there are bills that we've
 
02:50:42.479 --> 02:50:43.349 align:start position:0%
if they're if there are bills that we've
retained

02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
that people don't spend their time
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
working on individually as small
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
committees i'm more than happy to
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
work on it as a committee as a whole and
 
02:50:54.309 --> 02:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
deal with them
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair do you need the speaker's
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
agreement if you are to act uh to start
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
acting on retain bills now
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not acting start working on retain
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
bills now
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the speakers over the years
 
02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
sometimes the speakers over the years
have

02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
had strong feelings about that and i'm
 
02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:21.910 align:start position:0%
had strong feelings about that and i'm
not

02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't i'm not privileged to speaker
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
um packard's views
 
02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh well joe i i'll join you with that
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't know my my guess is that he
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
has no objection to people working on
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
the bills the question is whether he's
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to pay mileage for people to do
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's been the problem in the past but
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
um or
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be in the building during the middle
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the summer so
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh but i will find that out
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair morgan
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah what is the time frame for
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
for acting on the conductivity what
 
02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:03.269 align:start position:0%
for acting on the conductivity what
happens

02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
happens
 
02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
if we come to consensus uh before the
 
02:52:06.319 --> 02:52:06.870 align:start position:0%
if we come to consensus uh before the
usual

02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
usual
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
october or november uh timeline where
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
retaining bills
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
under so-called normal circumstances are
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
are dealt with
 
02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
like is there any chance of voting any
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
of these uh
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
up or down uh before january 2022 or
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much uh they're on hold
 
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
till then which uh
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%

not a terrible thing
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
