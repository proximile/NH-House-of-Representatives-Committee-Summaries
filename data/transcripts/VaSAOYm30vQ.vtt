legislators the replacements are
 
00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 align:start position:0%

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
did i say that correctly
 
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
i guess so
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
and for representative bob elliott
 
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have a total of 18 bills
 
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
discuss today
 
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
we've had caucuses both in both parties
 
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
reviewing all bills
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
and i've talked with the
 
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
and i've talked with the
ranking

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
ranking
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
member from the other party
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
see where we stand it looks like that
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're consistent on about nine bills
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
that we could exact today
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
and do the exacting on these nine bills
 
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 align:start position:0%
we will discuss the other bill's
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
the first bill i want to exact i'm going
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
to hold
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
for a while because
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
i received an email this morning
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
from the dra
 
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
and the ra asked if it possibly could be
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
amended to
 
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
make one more change which is a simple
 
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.509 align:start position:0%
make one more change which is a simple
change

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect the law all of the
 
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.110 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect the law all of the
effects

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
effects
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
is the cost of mailing
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's considerable savings if we do this
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
so representative romney
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
races enough to run over
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
get the amendment done and it should be
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
brought down to us soon so i'm going to
 
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
brought down to us soon so i'm going to
delay

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh this is a
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill uh seeking to
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
allow voluntary
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
donations however it is a bit redundant
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
such donations
 
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.629 align:start position:0%
such donations
are

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
already allowed
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
in addition the wording to the bill
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
seems to converse commercialize such
 
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
seems to converse commercialize such
donations

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
donations
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
and may even leave the door open for
 
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
and may even leave the door open for
authorizing

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
one should also note that some agencies

donations of some types in medical

that this bill needs to take under
 
00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.070 align:start position:0%
that this bill needs to take under
consideration

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
in addition under rsa 3119 i a political

subdivision may accept donations for a
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
project this particular bill doesn't
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of that piece of
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
legislation because it doesn't designate
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
as to what type of
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
donation is being made and the supreme
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
court has laid out what the donations
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to be and you can also find that in
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
a 2013 municipal association uh white

therefore uh this bill should is
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
recommended in expedient to legislate at
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
in no further discussion i'll ask the

materials the
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of disposal
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%

the uh how the costs would be paid
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
and talking only about the technical
 
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.029 align:start position:0%
and talking only about the technical
aspects

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
of how this would be done
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
and how to reduce the
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
the bulk going into our landfills so
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we will still have landfills in
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
10-15 years in this state
 
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
10-15 years in this state
and

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
they they are open to taking anything

from this bill that is new to
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
producer extended responsibility concept
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
and including it as part of the study
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
the sponsor has
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
done some interesting work on
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
single-use products and and prop product
 
00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.830 align:start position:0%

packaging
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
use and
 
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
use and
is

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%

for that reason
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
and because
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
this also technically
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
would present a lot of issues
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we were to consider it in this
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
committee before the work has been done
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
by ena on
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%

the commitments that they have outside
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature that make it impossible
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
to expose themselves to the environment
 
00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:44.549 align:start position:0%
to expose themselves to the environment
so

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
on we are not
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
bringing in substitutes
 
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.909 align:start position:0%
bringing in substitutes
uh

00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
unless we think that there is are going
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
to be votes that we need to
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%

disappears very soon
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's not nice
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh yes well the bill
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
does set up a uh
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund for our county home
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh seating it with 25 000
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
million i'm sorry thank you a couple
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
more zeros i put my glasses back on
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
up to additional 15 million each year
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
but never to exceed 30 million in the
 
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.389 align:start position:0%
but never to exceed 30 million in the
fund

00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
the the reality is that everybody who
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill was from sullivan
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
county and i will i will recognize that
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
sullivan county does have a problem in
 
00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:47.430 align:start position:0%
sullivan county does have a problem in
that

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
that
they

00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
their nursing home needs to be replaced
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
but the price tag has now gone up to 54
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the county to do so
 
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.029 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the county to do so
uh

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the problem we got is that
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
all counties have the same issue
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
the thing one thing that's unique about
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
sullivan county is that
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
the highest percentage
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
of nursing home patients 56
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
of any county that is treated they don't
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
have many independent nursing home beds
 
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
have many independent nursing home beds
in

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know independent
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
and so there's a higher reliance on on
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
their nursing home
 
00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.389 align:start position:0%
their nursing home
for

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
for this the problem with the bill
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
though is
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
once we get into this terrain of of
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
doing a bell
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
there really was no other testimony from
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
any other county any other county
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
executive saying let's do this bill it
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
was everybody who testified was sullivan
 
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.509 align:start position:0%
was everybody who testified was sullivan
county

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
i think long-term
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to inter-study it
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
but my suggestion and i've made this uh
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
already is that they just look for an
 
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.230 align:start position:0%
already is that they just look for an
appropriation

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
let's not go through
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
developing this capital fund but let's
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
go through and just try to get an
 
00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:03.029 align:start position:0%
go through and just try to get an
appropriation

00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the budget to so to
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
solve their problem
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
but for now we're just going to i'm
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we interim study this
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh to keep it alive but uh but that that
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
would be my suggestion so
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
so again i think it'll be
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
again no other counties asking for this
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
the municipal association well they
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
don't really represent the county so
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
no one else really came in other than
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
sullivan county people to testify on
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
this bill so
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
with that i think we hopefully we can
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
study this thank you
 
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
study this thank you

i believe that the head of the

i believe that the head of the

who is from my county
 
00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:55.909 align:start position:0%
who is from my county
on

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
sent a letter in about this
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is a major problem
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
for two counties and i'm not quite sure
 
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
for two counties and i'm not quite sure
why

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
coast didn't
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
send anybody in but they have actually a
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
worse monetary problem on this
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
there are two counties that are at the
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
very bottom of the list in
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of real estate valuation per
 
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.389 align:start position:0%
the amount of real estate valuation per
capita

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
capita
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
koas first and sullivan second
 
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.750 align:start position:0%
koas first and sullivan second
and

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
they really have serious problems with
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
being able to rebuild their nursing
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
homes especially with the increase in
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
federal regulations on what has to go
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
on however we are in a major
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have major question marks about
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
what our revenues are going to look like
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
by the end of this fiscal year never
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
mind the next couple
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
and this is would be a huge amount of
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
spending on
 
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
spending on
and

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
has a great deal of
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
vagueness about how much money could go
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
to different counties for what
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we do know that a number of the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
counties that are better off would be
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
regarding this as an ordinary funding
 
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
regarding this as an ordinary funding
source

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
when they had
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
a small rehab to do
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
and 5 million at this point is a small
 
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
and 5 million at this point is a small
rehab

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
rehab
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is the only thing that's in the
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
it does need a lot of study
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it's going to need a lot of thought
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think over following years of what we
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
can do to help especially those two
 
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.710 align:start position:0%
can do to help especially those two
counties

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
the obligation we've put on them
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
most of the medicaid costs of their
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
of their residents when they
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
get too old to survive by themselves
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%

representative abrami and representative

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
almi
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
as the sole representative
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county on the ways and
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
means committee i just want to go on
 
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
means committee i just want to go on
record

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
as saying
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
that creating a reserve fund
 
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
that creating a reserve fund
programmatically

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
programmatically
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with all 10 counties in the
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
state over a span of decades
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
is probably just too heavy a lift
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
the need of sullivan county is severe
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
for a county of 42 000 population
 
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.710 align:start position:0%
for a county of 42 000 population
to

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
fund a 54 million
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
a capital
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
bond issue
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
which would then rest entirely on
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
real estate tax
 
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
real estate tax
which

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.630 align:start position:0%
which
already

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.589 align:start position:0%
already
is

00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
at or near the highest in the state
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
so that for example claremont
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
and charlestown
 
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.069 align:start position:0%
and charlestown
share

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
the distinct position with say berlin
 
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.750 align:start position:0%
the distinct position with say berlin
of

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
already having
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming real estate tax burden
 
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.589 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming real estate tax burden
so

00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think that our delegation will be
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
looking for an opportunity
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
for one-time surgical earmarked funds
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of arpa and other funds
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
that may be available and i just beg
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
every member who's here
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
when that comes around
 
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
when that comes around
please

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
 
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.510 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
tucker

tucker
 
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.870 align:start position:0%
tucker
yes

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
he did such a good job representatives
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
built free on
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
discussing sullivan
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh county coast county has two nursing
 
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.550 align:start position:0%
uh county coast county has two nursing
homes

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
we are heavily taxed and have tried to
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
keep up with capital expenditures
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh but we are in
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have trouble meeting on the operating
 
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.190 align:start position:0%
we have trouble meeting on the operating
costs

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we keep up the
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
capital costs
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
so that i imagine that we will be very
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
much in the same position within the
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
next few years
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
of coming possibly for a one-time
 
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:31.670 align:start position:0%
of coming possibly for a one-time
appropriation

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
two nursing homes is a problem
 
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.150 align:start position:0%
two nursing homes is a problem
and

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
geographically we're so large
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
that it's very difficult to go to one
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
that however is being mulled by some
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
people as a solution
 
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.430 align:start position:0%
people as a solution
so

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
coast needs to do its own study and we
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
certainly need
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislators who are interested in this
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
saying none then i'm going to ask the

well this is a well-meaning bill
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it's in its intent is to help
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
small businesses get started by
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
deferring their any uh tax burden they
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
may have on the bet business enterprise
 
00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.790 align:start position:0%

or the business profits tax
 
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.390 align:start position:0%
or the business profits tax
um

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're already in in the tax code i
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
believe allows this in that
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
until a business has reached at least 92
 
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.589 align:start position:0%
until a business has reached at least 92
000

00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
000
in

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
business receipts or 92 000
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
in i'm sorry 92 000 in net would they
 
00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:15.270 align:start position:0%
in i'm sorry 92 000 in net would they
pay

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
let me take that back until a business
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
has reached 92 000 in receipts they're
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
not going to pay the business profits
 
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:22.710 align:start position:0%
not going to pay the business profits
tax

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.589 align:start position:0%
tax
and

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
the business enterprise tax already has
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
a threshold of two hundred and seven
 
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.109 align:start position:0%
a threshold of two hundred and seven
thousand

00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
if it's less than two hundred and seven
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
thousand gross receipts then a business
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
would have to have at least a hundred
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
and three thousand
 
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.349 align:start position:0%
and three thousand
um

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
dollar value on the enterprise value
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
of the business so
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
it those numbers are high enough that
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
small businesses have a chance to to get
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
started to see
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
if they can make a run at it without
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
paying any taxes so again i think
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
hb 1541 is well well intentioned
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
no further discussion
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%

changed

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%

21-j colon 28-a
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
and section 2 of the statutes
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
where it looks like
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
they're just changing some wording here
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
um and again we're all just seeing this
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
for the first time so
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair we do have a representative of
 
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.270 align:start position:0%
mr chair we do have a representative of
uh

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
dra here who may be able to explain this
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
a little more than i can
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
but it looks pretty straightforward to
 
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.190 align:start position:0%
but it looks pretty straightforward to
me

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
d.r.a

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
d.r.a
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is keen ming wong
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
from department revenue administration
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
tax policy council
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill is basically uh
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the crux of it is to
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
reduce on the postage charges
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
um that when we sent out the
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
notices to um for refunds that were
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
requested by the taxpayers um so
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
what this does is that when taxpayers
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
submit a um a request for refund if the
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
refund is granted in full what normally
 
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
refund is granted in full what normally
happens

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the new system is that
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
a notice is sent out
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
even though if the
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
refund is granted info we will still
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
send out a notice saying okay yeah your
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
refund is now
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
approved in full
 
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.270 align:start position:0%
approved in full
so

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
wants to cut out that procedure in terms
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
of sending that notice when the refund
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
is granted in full and that notice will
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
only be sent out to the taxpayer
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
if the uh if it's a partial approval or
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions if
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
what it actually does is that if the
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
person is getting a full refund they
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
will just receive the full refund
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
it saves about six thousand mailings
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have to eat the number
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
in front of me but i'm assuming that's
 
00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:39.430 align:start position:0%
in front of me but i'm assuming that's
right

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right i do have a question
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
so i recently received a letter from dra
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
i had made a mistake
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
i was due a credit of nine dollars and
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
but the letter started out with the
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
phrase that it was in response
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
to my inquiry
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually i had not made an inquiry and
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
apparently that is and i i did call
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
there was a number and although i didn't
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
talk with the person who was on the
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
letter i talked with another
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative dra
 
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.069 align:start position:0%
representative dra
and

00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
that's on all the letters it says this
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
is in response to an inquiry it was not
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
in response to inquiry and this appears
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would not have known about this credit
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
if i had not received a letter even
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
though the beginning was
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
i now am aware that i need to give that
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
letter to my accountant
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
who will know that i have a credit of
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
nine dollars and some odd cents
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
for next year so
 
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.549 align:start position:0%
for next year so
uh

00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:58.559 --> 00:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
uh
are

00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
you need to make sure that those letters
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
are correct that the person
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
knows that someone is looking this was
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
right i know it's
 
00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
right i know it's
um

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to see if
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
i can answer a question here
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
um probably um i think
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the reason why those
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a there's a standard verbiage
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
on the letters right now with the new
 
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
on the letters right now with the new
system

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
um and that might have been in there for
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
all the letters so we will definitely
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
have to go through that and uh
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
right because this only will work if the
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
person knows there's a possibility
 
00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
person knows there's a possibility
that

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
right there's a refund coming
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
or credit being given
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
and if they haven't initiated it
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
themselves they wouldn't know about it
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah i hear you
 
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah i hear you
um

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
however this amendment to the bill um is
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
not in that situation it's not for that
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is for
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are requesting refund
 
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are requesting refund
and

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the notices that goes out
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
i received this morning from the dra
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
an email
 
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
an email
for

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
further clarification let me just read
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
it to you
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
currently when a taxpayer requests a
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
refund or or credit on their tax return
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
we are required to send them written
 
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.309 align:start position:0%
we are required to send them written
notification

00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:43.109 align:start position:0%
notification
both

00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
when we grant the requested refund or
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
credit when we deny the requested refund
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
or credit
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
we would like to send notifications only
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
if we are denying and whole or
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
importantly requested refund or credit
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
this change will prevent the mailing of
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
over 6 000 duplicate letters each year
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that the written notice is
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary from a due process
 
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:12.230 align:start position:0%
unnecessary from a due process
perspective

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
when we have granted the taxpayers
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
request in full and therefore no appeal
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity results
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
and that's why only this specific
 
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:26.390 align:start position:0%
and that's why only this specific
case

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.910 align:start position:0%
any further questions
yes

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's not a question
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i would say that the taxpayer
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%

for business profits tax purposes

determine net operating loss using the
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code of 1996 this bill
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
updates the statutes to require the use

for the business profits tax which is
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
currently the internal revenue code
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
of 2018. this change will not result in
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
a meaningful difference in the amount of
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
nol permitted but will relieve taxpayers
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
of the onerous task of using a version
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
of the tax code that is 25 years old the
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%

mr chairman
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's where the nine percent is removed
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that every time we change the tax
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
rate again they won't have to change
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
i have one other bill that
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
had an open question but the question
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
seems like it was answered this morning
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
and that's on the house bill 1430.
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
that was the question that you had asked
 
01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:35.109 align:start position:0%
that was the question that you had asked
on

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
only you and i at this point have got
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
the response from carolyn lear because
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
i just copied it to you and she just
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
copied it back to you and me
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
so i could read off
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
that or
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to save it for a work
 
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.349 align:start position:0%
we're going to save it for a work
session

01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
then we are through with executing
 
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
then we are through with executing
on

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
bills in the possession of
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
with a work session on the remaining
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
the idea is
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
on each of these remaining nine bills
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh the more information we need to make
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
or do we have enough to make a decision
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
or anything else
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to a house bill
 
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.870 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to a house bill
1097

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
1097
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
you want to talk a conversation
 
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.109 align:start position:0%

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
this this bill was put
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
submitted uh
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
because of the what massachusetts had
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
done during the peak of the
 
01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
done during the peak of the
endemic

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
endemic
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
where they changed their rules
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts where if you worked in
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
you work with a company that sometimes
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
you you go into the office in mass
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes you work at home
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
the portion of time you work at home you
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
were never taxed you prorate the the
 
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:04.309 align:start position:0%
were never taxed you prorate the the
amount

01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
you only get tax
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
on mass tax when you're in in
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts physically working they
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
changed their law
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic to say during their
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
that

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
that would no longer apply that that
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
people working in
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
at home
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
with offices in massachusetts would have
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
to pay the mass tax 100 percent
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
appears to
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
say we
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
we want to prevent that from happening
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh well actually the future the sponsor
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
thought it was still in place we found
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
out since
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
that the massachusetts state of
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency is has been lifted
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that this um executive order had
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
also been lifted
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
so there's there'd be no direct
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
impact of us passing this bill on
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
current employees that are working at
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
home because that's been lifted
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the question becomes for the
 
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.189 align:start position:0%
uh the question becomes for the
committee

01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
do we see any value here in passing this
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
anyway for future
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
situations that come up
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the point of
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
discussion that we get we need to have
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it at that for a moment
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
any response representative
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes as a
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
um we i do recognize that currently it
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
is not needed however
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping massachusetts
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
or any other state from
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
imposing something like this in the
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
future and i think it's it's still
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to pass this so we
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
protect new hampshire citizens
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
like others i was upset by massachusetts
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
unilateral action
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
and i think the state does in fact have
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
an interest in protecting its
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
residents against attacks
 
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
residents against attacks
on

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
work performed in new hampshire
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the problem with the bill as it's
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
drafted is it's purely exhortatory it
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
just simply says
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
to massachusetts or any other state
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing enforceable about it
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i think perhaps an amendment
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
that redirected it slightly would be
 
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.830 align:start position:0%
that redirected it slightly would be
more

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
constructive so for example
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are two elements that could be
 
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.630 align:start position:0%
there are two elements that could be
helpful

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the event that a state does the same
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
thing in the future
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
one is a clear statement
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
of state interest
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
so as to underpin a claim of standing
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
before a court
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
and second
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
is perhaps an instruction
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the executive branch or the attorney
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
general that when such a situation
 
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.270 align:start position:0%
general that when such a situation
arises

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
arises
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
they have an obligation to
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
engage in litigation
 
01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.310 align:start position:0%
engage in litigation
so

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
we understand that the
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court declined to
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
hear the case
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a situation where they
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
remanded it to a lower court it's it's a
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
rare example of original jurisdiction
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
which gives them the discretion to hear
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
cases between states
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that there was political
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
pressure on the court not to hear it
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i think they didn't want to take up
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
a case that they didn't feel
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
that they had to
 
01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
that they had to
resolve

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
i do think though i don't recall that it
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
was stated in the supreme court's
 
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
was stated in the supreme court's
opinion

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
that a key underlying procedural hurdle
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
was standing
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
what is the standing of the state of new
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire to assert the claim for harm
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
to individual wage earners
 
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
to individual wage earners
so

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
my question is this
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
as written i don't think it's worth
 
01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.870 align:start position:0%
as written i don't think it's worth
passing

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
can we revise it
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
to focus on standing
 
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.950 align:start position:0%
to focus on standing
and

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
on instruction to the attorney general
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
to actually wage the battle
 
01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.709 align:start position:0%
to actually wage the battle
represent

01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
the point that was just made seems to be
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
the the crux of the matter
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
as to give the state standing over
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
actions by other states we ran across
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
this earlier uh to a lesser well
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually to about the same degree with
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
the interstate sales tax
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh activity
 
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.070 align:start position:0%
uh activity
this

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
falls into that same category
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
the state didn't have in place
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
a strong enough
 
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
a strong enough
position

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe this this bill
 
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.229 align:start position:0%
and i believe this this bill
is

01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for that to get done i think
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's up to this committee to come up
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
strong position and i think we can get
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
some guidance from the attorney general
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is about income taxation and
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
on there are a number of states that on
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
reach deep into the pockets and and
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
cities that reach deep into the pockets
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
of people who don't live in most places
 
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
of people who don't live in most places
but

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
but work there i think it's
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
probably well i don't think it's quite
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
the same as the sales tax one i would
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
really like to get a good discussion
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general about
 
01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general about
on

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative ames and followed by
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess my uh
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
request for
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
work to be done in this study is uh did
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
not study this work session
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
similar to representative omni's uh but
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
a little different i i'd like to uh i
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
find i find the language here
 
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.709 align:start position:0%
find i find the language here
um

01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
very broad and i want to be sure that
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
what's wrapped up into any language
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's the subject of a bill like this
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
is clear
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i would uh want to have from dra
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
information i'd like to have
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
a report or a discussion with dra on
 
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.990 align:start position:0%
a report or a discussion with dra on
the

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
taxes that we
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
we apply that we have the bet and the
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
bbt particularly
 
01:14:57.199 --> 01:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
bbt particularly
to

01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
we're not shooting ourselves in in the
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
foot so to speak and
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps uh saying that some
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
services that are physically performed
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
and take away our powered attacks and
 
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.709 align:start position:0%
and take away our powered attacks and
implicitly

01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
implicitly
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
contradict the position we're taking
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
with our tax laws so i i just like to be
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not uh
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this
question

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i did some i'm
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
concurring that we we need the guidance
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's office on this
 
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.189 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's office on this
one

01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would be helpful to
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
find out who the point person was in the
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
supreme court case
 
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
supreme court case
that

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
that wasn't really heard
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that they're most familiar
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
with this so if we can determine who
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is that probably the person we want
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
to talk to
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate this morning we do have
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
somebody from the attorney general's
 
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
somebody from the attorney general's
office

01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
roger

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
we would like that we'll set it up
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
any further
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on what we need to get more
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
information on
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
then we will
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
have a work session
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
you could
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
provide that information so that i'm
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%

members of the committee
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
do we need additional information on
 
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.149 align:start position:0%
do we need additional information on
this

01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
representing yearly i spoke to the uh
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill of representing
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
daughter and uh she would be very happy
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh if we had a uh
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill to gain any
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any suggestions on
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of information they need
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
projections uh something for uh from
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
information as to why it applies both uh
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
only to the bpt and not the bet or is
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
the offset continued into this bill
 
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
the offset continued into this bill
okay

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
all right mr chair i don't think that
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
should be a long
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh drawn out discussion i think that's
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh information that if we just sit down
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
or we have some open time we can go
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
review that and come up with a
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
decision on our own
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative oh i'm sorry
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative next chair
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think the information we need
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
is going to come too late
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that we need to really know
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in april and
 
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.229 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in april and
beyond

01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
because that's when most of the filings
 
01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:21.189 align:start position:0%
because that's when most of the filings
happen

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
and we have concerns about the ppp
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
refunds whether how many are there going
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of refunds or not
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and the credit carry forward issue is a
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
big one that we really won't know
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
so i mean about absolutely let's have
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
the let's have the uh
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
the work session on it but
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
those there's some pieces of the puzzle
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we we still don't know as to
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
how how are we really doing right now
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh because of the concern about
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
more about refunds this this april
 
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.110 align:start position:0%
more about refunds this this april

90 to 100 million dollars that we may

have to be giving back in march april
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%

only the most firm of our worries we

don't know what market-based sourcing

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
is going to do
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
to our returns
 
01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
to our returns

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
starting single sales factor impact on
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
our revenues
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's extremely volatile and
 
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.669 align:start position:0%
that's extremely volatile and
it

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
seems likely that it would reduce the
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
bpt because we
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
export a lot more
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
on than we consume in this state and so
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
if we're switching to only in state
 
01:20:53.199 --> 01:20:54.629 align:start position:0%

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
we may be losing
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
big time we don't know
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
then there's the credit carry forward
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then there's the economy which on
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be losing a fair amount of
 
01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:18.709 align:start position:0%
is going to be losing a fair amount of

01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
oomph that was keeping on pushing it
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
on and is going to have to be reacting
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
to inflation and is still reacting to

am
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think that a lot of us are severely
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
worried by
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
surplus will have left in june
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
never mind next year and the finance
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee in its wisdom had
 
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
committee in its wisdom had
had

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
had
limited

01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the reduction in those tax cuts this
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
last time in order to be able to pass a
 
01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
last time in order to be able to pass a
budget

01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
that made sense to them
 
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
that made sense to them
so

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.629 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
i really think that
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult for us
 
01:22:10.239 --> 01:22:11.430 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult for us
to

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.229 align:start position:0%
to
have

01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
enough foresight to figure out whether
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
we could afford to do this without
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:23.890 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
thanks

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
um as i look at this i i agree we need
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
to be careful because we we don't know
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh how things may change and we also
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
have to um the credit carry over
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
certainly is a is an issue to be
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
cognizant of one of the things that i'm
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking and i'd like to
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
definitely hear from
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
dra in a work session
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
is possibly splitting this out because
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
when i look at the revenue
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
projection or revenue loss projection
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's the bet that has the much
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
bigger impact here
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
at about according to this chart 27
 
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.189 align:start position:0%
at about according to this chart 27
million

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
by 2025 27 million less
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
when i look at the bpt business profits
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:12.070 align:start position:0%
when i look at the bpt business profits
tax

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's about their projection is about 8
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
million less
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
by 2025.
 
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
by 2025.
and

01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe we split this out where we we
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
keep the bet where it is at .55 but we
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
potentially lower the bpt
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
from 7.6 to 7.5
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the thought there is
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
not only is is the change much less
 
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.390 align:start position:0%
not only is is the change much less
but

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
when when companies
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
think about i mean part of the strategy
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
here is lowering the bpt
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
and bet
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
to have business encourage businesses
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
from from other states or just people
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
start businesses
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're gonna most of the time they they
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
look at it and they say gee what's the
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
business profits tax because not a lot
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
of other states have something called a
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
that top line number is compared quite
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
often so
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's an advantage for new
 
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
i think it's an advantage for new
hampshire

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
to to say we have a 7.5
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and let's leave the
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
bet as it is
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the current law at 0.55 so my
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
proposal would be we look at just
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
lowering the bpt but i agree i'd like to
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
hear from dra and get some more
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
information as well
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if we were going to consider
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
that i think that we would need the be
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the dra to recalculate
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
how much each of how much that loss
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:24:44.639 --> 01:24:45.830 align:start position:0%
would be
and

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i for one do not believe that this
 
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.470 align:start position:0%
i i for one do not believe that this
minor

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
minor
tax

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
reduction on the bpt or in fact any of
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
the ones that we've been doing has an
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
bringing in businesses to this state so
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
in general i'm
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
opposed but
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
this whole business of
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
tax reduction
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
is not clear
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
you don't really know what's
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
right now we're sitting in the rainy day
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
fund a couple hundred million dollars
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
but in that rainy day fund of a couple
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
is the credit carry forward
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
credit carried forward it's like 275
 
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.990 align:start position:0%
credit carried forward it's like 275
million

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
it could disappear
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
we may have to give it away right away
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's a about a hundred million
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in the ppp that we're going to
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
have to get back because we we were
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
taxing it before we said we're not going
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
to tax it
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's another thing
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
our revenues are looking great
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
and why are they looking great
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking great because all the
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
stimulus that has been put into this
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
over the last two years
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
they've kept all of our businesses alive
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
and when you keep them alive and you
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the expenses because the
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
government's paying for them you're
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
that profit is going to go away part of
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to go away after the stimulus
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
is a stop
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
because you can't
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide this to us all the time until
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
somebody pays for that stimulus
 
01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.709 align:start position:0%
somebody pays for that stimulus
so

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
all the tax cuts that we've done so far
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
need to settle down
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
and see what happens
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
before we start
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
adding more tax cuts to it
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why we need to go
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
look at this more deeply
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
in a work session
 
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.350 align:start position:0%
in a work session
so

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
so
representative

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i think and i
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
apologize i haven't been around a lot
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
much in this community but i'm i'm
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
available now but uh the revenue
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
projections that we look at and and
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing revenue projections i think play
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
a big part in this as you said you know
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
we know we have ind tax cuts coming
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
along the line down the road and a lot
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
of other things so i think looking at
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
this thing is a big picture not through
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
a straw
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
is extremely important so as we're
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward i'd like us to seize look
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
at those uh have the lba do you know
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
give us our budget projections out for
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
five or ten years and look at you know
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
the what-if scenarios what if we drop
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
this what if we do that so we can see
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
what that looks like
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's extremely important to
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
understand tax policy as a whole for the
 
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.229 align:start position:0%
understand tax policy as a whole for the
state

01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
you remind me
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
starting friday
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
we have a full day of
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
economic briefings
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
we have a full day of economic briefing
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
starting this friday and this friday
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from the lba
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
and they'll go over
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
all the time all the taxes that they
 
01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.590 align:start position:0%
all the time all the taxes that they
have

01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
how they've been where we are and
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully give us some projections
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with the
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
dra and then we'll hear from housing
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from
 
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from
labor

01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
labor
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
and others
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
you may get tired of it
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then the following friday will do
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing but we'll do it with
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
economist so we'll find out
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
how the economy has been
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
how it is now and what's projected in
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
nationally regionally
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
and how it will affect new hampshire
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
and we will redo some of these things
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
later on after
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
march and april the
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
revenue months coming in
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a better handle on see
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
we can separate the ppp and the stimulus
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
and look at the regular revenues coming
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
in we don't have that information right
 
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.110 align:start position:0%
in we don't have that information right
now

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
any further comments on house bill 1221
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to a work session on
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
1430

01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
1430
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
an act
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
repealing the tax on rentals of motor
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles under the meals and rooms tax
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
and representative had asked from some
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
information the dra we received that
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
information this morning
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll be able to go through that in
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
a work session
 
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.950 align:start position:0%
a work session
uh

01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
the next is house bill 14.
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
i think at that meeting the
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
american car rental association also
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
wants to speak
 
01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.709 align:start position:0%
wants to speak
yes

01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:50.719 --> 01:30:51.910 align:start position:0%
yes
and

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
anybody that would like to speak make
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
themselves available because this has
 
01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.189 align:start position:0%
themselves available because this has
been

01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
put into this week's calendar
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
that we're having a work session on
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
the next is house bill 1450
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
an act including agricultural resources
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
under the land and community heritage
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of new information do we need
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
on this belt
 
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.510 align:start position:0%
on this belt

01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair as i remember the public
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and we heard from i uh
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it was the uh
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of the commission of
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
agriculture that
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
this is already covered and that there
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
was really no need to change the law
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
that under natural resources they they
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
consider agriculture and farming so i'm
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
not sure what new information we would
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
need to get it was pretty clear even
 
01:32:02.159 --> 01:32:02.950 align:start position:0%
need to get it was pretty clear even
from

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the people from l-chip that this was
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
also um
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they they do already put into
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
conservation large agricultural tracks
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that there is any more
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
information we really need to get for
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
this and maybe an ital motion would be
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay
 
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.030 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay
representative

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
tucker well if if we are going to look
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
into the idea of agricultural resources
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
being protected i think it would be
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
important to know how many land trusts
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
have

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
directed themselves towards preserving
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
agricultural resources
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
my impression is that it's a lot
 
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
my impression is that it's a lot
but

01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
it would be good idea to find out how
 
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
it would be good idea to find out how
many

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
land trusts there are that are
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
our agricultural resources in the state
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
in other words there there are other
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
organizations other than l-chip
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
that are directing themselves to this
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
are you working on that
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
i can try to find out just send out
 
01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.390 align:start position:0%
i can try to find out just send out
but

01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's quite typical but i so
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps this is something like the
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
society for the new hampshire
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
protection of new hampshire forests
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
will actually know how many land trusts
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
are available to working on this
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
looks like this is the only issue that's
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
holding this bill up at this point well
 
01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.709 align:start position:0%
holding this bill up at this point well
if

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the only issue let's uh
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
we can find out some other time but if
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's ready to move
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's fine too okay then we
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
should be able to deal with this at our
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
work session right yeah
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill had two parts and the
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
other one is taking more money from
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
general and education trust funds to
 
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
general and education trust funds to
l-chip

01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
l-chip
 
01:34:00.639 --> 01:34:01.430 align:start position:0%
l-chip
so

01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm not in favor of that myself
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what our finances
 
01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what our finances
are

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
finance itself ought to be
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with that but
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
do you know of anything that could
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
we would need additional information in
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
order to be able to act on this bill no
 
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.709 align:start position:0%
order to be able to act on this bill no
okay

01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:24.719 --> 01:34:25.990 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with representative valami
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
it does take money it does
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
require an additional quarter percent be
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
taken out of the uh
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that that amounts to about five
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
hundred and six thousand dollars
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
annually based that was based on last
 
01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
annually based that was based on last
year's

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
what we knew the transactions were
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
it was pretty high here in terms of
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
housing transactions and
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the revenue was pretty high
 
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of the revenue was pretty high
so

01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know and 33 percent of that
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
506 000 would go to education and 67
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
would go to general fund
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm ready to go on this but i'm
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
wait and
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
and you know have a work session on it
 
01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.109 align:start position:0%
and you know have a work session on it
but

01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
so but i don't know what we're going to
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
resolve there i think it's either either
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
we want this or we don't but thank you
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have any new information then
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be exacting this
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
relative to relative to the business
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax applicable to certain large
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you know again at
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
least if i recall a public hearing on
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill it was
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
there was bipartisa consensus bipartisan
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
consensus that
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was unconstitutional based on
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
the equitable
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
and proportional clause of our
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
constitution and i'm not sure what new
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
information we need beyond that to just
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
a question mr chairman representative
 
01:36:10.159 --> 01:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
a question mr chairman representative
lange

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
lange
 
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.229 align:start position:0%
lange
uh

01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
who is the authority that this is a
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh
 
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.629 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh
uh

01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh direction that we would be taking
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely susan almighty agreed
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative i i don't believe i was
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
quite that definitive about it
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think on and
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
on my explorations on this have been
 
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.229 align:start position:0%
on my explorations on this have been
that

01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
we really wouldn't know until we took it
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:49.830 align:start position:0%
to the court
whether

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
it was likely to be considered
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or not
 
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.750 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or not
on

01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.790 align:start position:0%
on
but

01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
also there are
 
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.390 align:start position:0%
also there are
major

01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
changes that would need to be made to
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
make this bill work as at this point
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
it looks like if you are a multinational
 
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.430 align:start position:0%
it looks like if you are a multinational
with

01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
a company in honduras which is paying
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
less than 15 an hour that you would have
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
to pay the higher tax in new hampshire
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
even if it was constitutional
 
01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:25.109 align:start position:0%
even if it was constitutional
or

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
or you're paying 15
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
14 and 10 cents to somebody in texas who
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
is cleaning bathrooms
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
that you would be
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to pay the extra tax in new
 
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.470 align:start position:0%
have to pay the extra tax in new
hampshire

01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
on i think it would need a fair amount
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
of work if
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
we wanted to go forward with this
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
my view is that this is something that
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
belongs in the labor committee
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with minimum wages
 
01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.910 align:start position:0%
dealing with minimum wages
but

01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is dispute in my side of the clock
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
unless somebody can come up with
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
something you really know
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
this should be ready for exactly
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative romney yes i i want to i
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
want to concur with representative this
 
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.590 align:start position:0%
want to concur with representative this
is

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
really a labor bill
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's disguised as a waste of means
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill that's a way to phrase it and i
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
think uh i'll just talk i'll speak for
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
our caucus uh
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't think this this bill is is
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time thank you mr
 
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.510 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time thank you mr
chairman

01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
was a chair to
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%

01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
that would be your
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
expert on that and uh
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
in reading his
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
or re-reading his little um
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
brief yeah this
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it in addition the sponsor of
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
named businesses to be discriminated
 
01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:07.270 align:start position:0%
named businesses to be discriminated
against

01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
and you can't do that in the bill
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can't do that in any law
 
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
you can't do that in any law
representative

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh as a member of

the current labor committee and on my

third term there
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a backdoor attempt at
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage bill and i would
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
be very in favor of an itl motion on
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
so we'll have some work to do next

representative
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes i i thought it'd be valuable to hold
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh for a work session um
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
i reached out
 
01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:15.030 align:start position:0%
i reached out
to

01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
to
uh

01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
james jerry from who is the director
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
of municipal and property division of
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue and he's
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
willing to come in and talk to us about
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of this bill so we
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
have somebody who'll come in and talk to
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
if i uh this was was this the bill that
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about broadband i'm trying
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
to remember if this was the one
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
so my concern with this bill was giving
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
a broad-based widespread tax break with
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that it would be used to help
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
the last mile conversation
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
by giving them the tax break they would
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
reinvest back into the broadband to do
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
the last mile conversation the problems
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
were no actual provisions in the bill to
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
make them reinvest for the last mile
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
we'd just be giving a tax break without
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
a benefit of actually expanding
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
broadband within our communities
 
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.189 align:start position:0%
broadband within our communities
um

01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
and and then you would look at
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
communities like manchester which
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily don't have
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh very many places where you can't get
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
broadband and you look at communities up
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
in coast county which has a lot but we
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
still be giving a tax break to
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
manchester while coast county has no
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
ability to expand broadband
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
i did bring up a general idea of
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
making this enabling statute to allow a
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
municipality to be able to enable a tax
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
break locally and use and do a kind of a
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
pilot program where uh
 
01:41:38.639 --> 01:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
pilot program where uh
the

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
the
broadband

01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
providers could say hey look if you give
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
us this tax break we'll agree to
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
to invest that much money back into your
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
community to expand and then it would be
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
a local enabling enabling uh provision
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
right so if my community has problems
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
with with broadband the last mile
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
conversation we could choose to extend a
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
tax break to our carrier and say hey
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
look we're going to give you a tax break
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
totaling 150 thousand dollars we want
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
you to do 150 000 miles 150 000 worth of
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrade and we'll trade
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
you that tax break for the upgrade to
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
help our community
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and i i don't know whether anybody's
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
interested in doing i'm happy to take
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
the on to doing a book to see do an
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to allow that enabling statute
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
to allow local communities to be able to
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
waive this tax locally and but only in
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
favor of doing basically a trade with
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
the with the provider otherwise i think
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's just a tax break
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
you make a good point
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
put together an amendment
 
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
put together an amendment
absolutely

01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1494
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
over in the corner
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
mackin phillips thank you mr chair i
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
think it might be worthy to have dra
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
produce some sort of analysis about what
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
kind of fiscal impact this might make uh
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
it'd be worthy to just review that
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
information i think if we're in
 
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.550 align:start position:0%
information i think if we're in
consideration

01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know i
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
that was something that i think was
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
brought up during the original testimony
 
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
brought up during the original testimony
and

01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
it might be worth checking out
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
anybody who's interested in helping or
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
comment a conversation about that
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
romney yes uh representative phillips
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think we should do that now
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
when i call
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
to set that up i'll i'll see if they can
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
quickly put some together we were handed
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
something out by uh
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
by uh an assessor
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
san soucy's company
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
but it was just for
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
his his towns not not all the towns and
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
cities so
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah i think it'd be interesting to
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
see what the what the impact would be on
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
all all towns the 200 plus that we have
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'd just like to express interest in
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative lang's
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh being one of the san souci
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
towns there which i hadn't realized he
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
was doing ours
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
now on
 
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:30.790 align:start position:0%
now on
it

01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
the towns at this point have very little
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
leverage against the cable companies to
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
get them to do
 
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.590 align:start position:0%
get them to do
on

01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
to do upgrades for the parts of their
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
access at this point which
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
there is a mile long stretch between
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
lebanon and hanover which
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
they kept in the dark
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
and which we haven't been able to do
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:45:02.239 --> 01:45:03.109 align:start position:0%
anything about
but

01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:03.119 --> 01:45:04.229 align:start position:0%
but
on

01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
this would give
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
give individual towns that were really
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with this
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
some leverage if they want to use it
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
so the two of you guys can work together
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
all right the next
 
01:45:26.239 --> 01:45:28.470 align:start position:0%
all right the next
is

01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.830 align:start position:0%

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.070 align:start position:0%
hire
a

01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
administrator for the frm victims
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%

compensation fund
um

01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the uh that fund began the legislation
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
was first enacted in 2016
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then in
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
2021 there was an appropriation made of
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars for that fund
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so it was with that appropriation
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we were able to then go out and
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
hire someone that person began work
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
in november
 
01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
in november
and

01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.149 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
last week we uh sent out the
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
applications for compensation under that
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's up and
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh running right now so that's the
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%

hb 1509 would terminate that fund that's
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
a policy matter for um
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to consider i'd note
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%

quite a lot of controversy at the time
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was hurt
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
dramatic situation in the
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
governor's council with
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
a resignation of the of a commissioner
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
some complaints by the sec
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
and there was some pointed out at least
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the press some
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
quote unquote deficiencies in the um

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
being done to correct those so
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative ulery all of that
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
happened before
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
my time at the attorney general's office
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
fulfilling what the legislator the
 
01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.870 align:start position:0%
fulfilling what the legislator the
legislature

01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
set forth in in the statute that's so
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
is there some
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
way you can get somebody from the office
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
to come in next wednesday to answer
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions proposed by representative
 
01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:45.109 align:start position:0%
questions proposed by representative
yearly

01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
yearly
so

01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking about questions about
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
that i but i will go back and ask
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
but you're asking uh things that go back
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.310 align:start position:0%
in time
representative

01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
really require going back and figuring
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
out trying to figure out yet again
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
who was wrong about what which i
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
remember wasn't really completely
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
resolved at the time
 
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.830 align:start position:0%
resolved at the time
but

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature had a fair amount of
 
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
the legislature had a fair amount of
of

01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
voice in the mess that was created at
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
um but
what

01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to learn is your
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
how your process is going to work since
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.950 align:start position:0%
it looks
like

01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
you have to wait until you think you
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
have all of the applicants
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the fund before you can distribute
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
correct there's a deadline that was set
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
forth in the statute
 
01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:09.350 align:start position:0%
forth in the statute
um

01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.390 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
i don't want to mistake i'm not mindful
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
of it but it's in
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
may i believe
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
and um and we've reached out to the
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
mailing list that we have
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
potential claimants
 
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
potential claimants
and

01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
people in the victims community that
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
have contacts as well so the
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
administrator will be
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
continuing with reach out
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
in that regard
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time to distribute all
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
of the money before
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would repeal it
 
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
this bill would repeal it
well

01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.669 align:start position:0%
well
the

01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:55.679 --> 01:51:57.109 align:start position:0%
the
interestingly

01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
statute says that
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
so nothing is going to be distributed
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
until december 31
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes it's it the way it's written it's
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
like it can be made on december 31 of
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:20.790 align:start position:0%
each year
um

01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
is partially
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
reflective of the original funding
 
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
stream now there's 10 million dollars
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's been appropriated
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you recall prior to 2021
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
sourced from donations
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i think there may have been some
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
thought that money would trickle in over
 
01:52:44.159 --> 01:52:47.030 align:start position:0%
thought that money would trickle in over
years

01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
i envisioned that
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
that this work can be completed
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
and so the distributions could be made
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
on december 31 of of this year but the
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
statute does contemplate it could go on
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
and it would be then december 20 31 of
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
the following year as well
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman follow-up fellow
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
on so
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
will by december 31 will you have both
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
tranches the 10 million dollars
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative almighty was
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
referring to the fact that
 
01:53:20.159 --> 01:53:23.310 align:start position:0%
referring to the fact that
the

01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
2021

01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
amendment appropriated
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
5 million
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
as of last june july 1 or june 30 and
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
then the second
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
tranche if you will will come in in june
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
30th of 2022 so there will be a full 10
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
as of
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
that would be available at that point
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
so you would be sorry follow up you
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be capable of distributing all the
 
01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.390 align:start position:0%
would be capable of distributing all the
money

01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
money
before

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh but i put an asterisk on that
 
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.189 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh but i put an asterisk on that
because

01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:54:03.199 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
because
there's

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
um there are formulas in there it
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
depends on how much it's claimed
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
and then um the amount of compensation
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is available is 50 up to 50
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
it would be speculating for me to
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
predict whether the full 10 million
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
subject to distribution
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i could could i just
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up could i ask
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
can you find out from
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
someone in the attorney general's office
 
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:41.990 align:start position:0%
someone in the attorney general's office
whether

01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
on there is any state that has ever
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursed investors without losing a
 
01:54:48.159 --> 01:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
reimbursed investors without losing a
lawsuit

01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
in similar kinds of cases
 
01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.189 align:start position:0%
in similar kinds of cases
um

01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
i am i'm
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
i could ask i'm not sure
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.239 --> 01:55:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
i have a number
 
01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
i have a number
representative

01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
romney followed by representative tucker
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
my concern is that this is a classic
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
bait and switch i know i think this is a
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
really bad look if we if we pass this
 
01:55:35.199 --> 01:55:36.229 align:start position:0%
really bad look if we if we pass this
bill

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:36.239 --> 01:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
but i i have a question for
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative walner you're the
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
minority leader
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the in um
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
over in finance
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh obviously it would this this was my
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that this was in house
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
um my question is was that how
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
hard was this debated in how and finance
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
can you recall because none of us really
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
knew about this until we voted the
 
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
knew about this until we voted the
budget

01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
so it was it's in there uh was it did it
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
come in as another bill that became part
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
of arsenal too can you recall
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think it did come in as a bill and
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
then uh division one
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
held the bill and it was rolled into
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i'm sorry
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
it came in as a separate bill i can't
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
remember the number of it or much about
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
it but
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
then division one held that bill
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then it rolled into house bill two
 
01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:36.149 align:start position:0%
and then it rolled into house bill two
okay

01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you that's my memory someone else
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:52.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
the

01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
recurring question
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we can get some of that
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
information that uh representative olney
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
asked from
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
ask ols research uh as regarding other
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
states but this fund in no way makes
 
01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.229 align:start position:0%
states but this fund in no way makes
whole

01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
any individual investor does it
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
so this uh representative uhlery the
 
01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.390 align:start position:0%
so this uh representative uhlery the
statute

01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.189 align:start position:0%
statute
uh

01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
creates a formula
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
debits and credits to it and at the end
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
there's a claim amount
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then the maximum that can be
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
could you provide the committee with uh
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
a charter graph of the the that

it's

it's
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's right in the statute um the
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislature created the form actually
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite unusual so
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
um i'm not trying to dodge your question
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative eulery but it's right in
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for for that uh

um
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
is there any way that you could get uh
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
someone from your office uh to to
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%

01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
a recurrence of this
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
my question goes to
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh what part of the
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
information that you're going to be
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
and producing will be public
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're dealing with individual names
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
and uh amounts
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh there'll be an amount applied for and
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
there'll be amount distributed
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
assuming this goes through and not
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
somehow short-circuited by this bill
 
01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.629 align:start position:0%
somehow short-circuited by this bill
so

01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
what will the public know
 
01:59:12.239 --> 01:59:13.589 align:start position:0%
what will the public know
and

01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:13.599 --> 01:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
and
yeah

01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames that's a good
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
question we haven't uh come to a
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion on that the
 
01:59:20.239 --> 01:59:21.510 align:start position:0%
conclusion on that the
statute

01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
requires that um
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
claimants provide
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
um tax return information
 
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.030 align:start position:0%
um tax return information
um

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is typically not public and may be
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
exempt from the right to know law
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh but i would imagine that the
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
distribution amounts
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
certainly would be subject to
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
right to know the names and
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
any distribution amounts would be
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
i was listening with interest to the
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
exchange between representative olney
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the ag's rep regarding dates
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
speaking to you mike
 
02:00:08.239 --> 02:00:09.350 align:start position:0%
speaking to you mike
sure

02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
sure
so

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know on an initial reading of this
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill i understand it to be uh an effort
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
to reverse the provisions that were
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into hb2
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i personally am not interested in
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
revisiting that and would not would not
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote for that
 
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:28.629 align:start position:0%
vote for that
but

02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
the second provision is essentially just
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
a sunset
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm curious
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
even if section one was dropped
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore we would not be
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
reversing the decisions the legislature
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
made in hb2
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
is there a value in having a sunset
 
02:00:49.599 --> 02:00:50.629 align:start position:0%
is there a value in having a sunset
provision

02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
in light of what you were saying about
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
these ongoing annual
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
and potential donations and december
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
31st payments
 
02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
31st payments
um

02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
so first of all we're not taking a
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
position on this bill this is a policy
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
matter so the attorney general's office
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
is not taking position on uh
 
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:11.990 align:start position:0%
is not taking position on uh
hb

02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
hb
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
1509. um there is a provision in the
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
current legislation for
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
um sunsetting of of whatever is left
 
02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.510 align:start position:0%
um sunsetting of of whatever is left
over

02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
in the current
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislation so that if there is money
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
left over at some point
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's a few years away
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to quote but it's several
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
years away
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
the money would lapse whatever's left
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
over in that fund
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay so there is a provision that would
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
sunset it but it's out in the future
 
02:01:50.159 --> 02:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
sunset it but it's out in the future
correct

02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.350 align:start position:0%
correct
representative

02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just to clarify
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
somebody had asked a question
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
about the original
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
where this frm
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
how it got into hb2 it did come across
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the original hb2
 
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
as part of the omnibus bill of hb2 it
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
was not a separate bill incorporated
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
can ask clarifying one question
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative was that was that in the
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
was that did that come across in the
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh question for you
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
can we ask jennifer to get that
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
provision or maybe the whole section of
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 that pertains to this that may be
 
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
hb2 that pertains to this that may be
helpful

02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:38.070 align:start position:0%
helpful
to

02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh some of the questions that have been
 
02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.310 align:start position:0%
uh some of the questions that have been
asked

02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah about the sun setting and all of
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
that jen could you copy
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
that section of house bill 2
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the frm
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative mr chairman and
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
there was an original
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
frm fund law which
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 was modifying so maybe we need that
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
piece of it too
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
i think we need to look at hb2
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
identify it and
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
get it
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
and then we would go and look for the
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
rest of the law
 
02:03:48.079 --> 02:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
rest of the law
okay

02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's like tracking
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
the statures
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
one refers to another one that it refers
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
to somebody else
 
02:04:00.159 --> 02:04:01.270 align:start position:0%
to somebody else
okay

02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other hands up
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
should be an interesting work session on
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
is house bill 1524 establishing a
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
national service alumni
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
attraction and retention fund
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
i got the honor of looking at this
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
well i volunteered for it
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
just a quick summary
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
this bill only creates a fund for
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
depositing of american rescue plan
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
monies grants or donations it does not
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
determine how much of the recovery
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
how much of the resources of the 584
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's still out that's
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
coming to the state will be used
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
it creates a fund that can allow grants
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be matched dollar to dollar for
 
02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:12.629 align:start position:0%
to be matched dollar to dollar for
employers

02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
and for colleges and no it will be at no
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
additional cost to taxpayers new
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire taxpayers but if there are
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
questions about the setup of just the
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
fund itself by this committee
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think we should invite gretchen
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
stallings the executive director of
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
and steve epstein volunteer new
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire board chair
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
to attend and give their expertise on
 
02:05:38.079 --> 02:05:39.030 align:start position:0%
to attend and give their expertise on
why

02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
this creation of this fund is so
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
important for workforce development
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is a first bill that's going to go
 
02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
this is a first bill that's going to go
a

02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
second bill will go to i think the
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee or
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
i do not know mr chair where it's going
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
next why i came here i do not know other
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
than we're just asked to create
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
a workforce fund
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
an alumni workforce fund right
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
it is not going to another committee so
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be this committee to
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it's coming to this
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee because we're in charge of
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
02:06:21.599 --> 02:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
uh

02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
but on
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
one of the key aspects of this for me is
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
to try to get treasury or someone to
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
tell us how much money is sitting there
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
in arpa
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire that is
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
on could be used for this apparently
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's a section in arpa that is for um
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
for exactly this kind of thing
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i think the money hasn't been maybe
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
there are seven
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
seven categories or eight categories
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
under arpa
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
and workforce development is one of them
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
and 19 million dollars went to that
 
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
and 19 million dollars went to that
portion

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.790 align:start position:0%
portion
but

02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.270 align:start position:0%
but
only

02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
410 million has been spent on the 497
 
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
billion that came in on the first round
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is coming in may
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
how they divide it up i do not know so
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair i mean
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
ranking member on me
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is the answer on that one i
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
treasury might be a good answer
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think treasury could help us
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
because we're never sure when we're
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
looking at these things also what the
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
date on them is
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative schoenberg would you send
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
me the names
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
of these people
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but this has been a question of
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
mine you know i was involved with one of
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
three people in rockingham county to
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
come up with our plan to spend 60-ish
 
02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
we came up with our plan completely
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
submitted it to the treasury and we've
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
already got half the payment i guess
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of towns and so forth
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
our counties have gotten their money
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh i to me it's a puzzle as to what the
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
that would be of interest
 
02:08:23.199 --> 02:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
that would be of interest
um

02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll take your word for it
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative schaumburg i always do
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
that this is maybe representative romney
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
as well that this does fall under the
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the treasury u.s treasury
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate way of spending that money so
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
but i i really have no idea what the
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
state plan is
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
and whether there's
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
money to additional money that's out
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
there that we we can work with so thank
 
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
there that we we can work with so thank
you

02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's just a statement more than
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
anything else mr chair
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
i i would like to know that too because
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's saying it's going to come
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
so chairman i don't know if we could get
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
gopher to talk with us
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's the it's i was thinking of the new
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire treasury not the fed treasury
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
trying to talk to the fed treasury is
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
kind of hard
 
02:09:22.159 --> 02:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
kind of hard
but

02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
but gopher
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
is apparently the one that
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
is handling all of this still and and
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
maybe they could explain some of this to
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
our committee because it's also relevant
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
we have our work to do on house bill 15
 
02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.750 align:start position:0%
we have our work to do on house bill 15
24.

02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the opioid abatement trust
 
02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:16.149 align:start position:0%
relative to the opioid abatement trust
fund

02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%

02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill to address
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
questions that were directed to me
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.229 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
and

02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment
 
02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment
01298

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
01298
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
so basically what i uh what i did was to
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
clear up some of the
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
language having to do with
 
02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
language having to do with
the

02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh allocation factor and how the
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
the calculation is clearer in this
 
02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
the calculation is clearer in this
amendment

02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:11.109 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:11.119 --> 02:12:12.390 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
the original bill had some language in
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
it that seemed kind of a little
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear as to what the calculation
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
really was
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i also added
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of the items that were in the
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's a companion
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's a senate bill that also
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh changes some language in the same
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
stat in in the same statute having to do
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement trust fund
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
so what i did was i added in what the
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
distribution of the funds should be
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
based on the most recent decennial
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
census instead of
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
the 2020 census
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to go back and change
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
that ever
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
of each qualifying county and political
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
subdivision that joined the national
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
litigation prior to september 1st 2019
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
according to following formula so the
 
02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
formula is the distribution shall be
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
calculated by multiplying the settlement
 
02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:11.589 align:start position:0%
calculated by multiplying the settlement
amount

02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
by the population factor and the
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
allocation factor where the population
 
02:13:18.149 --> 02:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
factor is derived by dividing
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
each qualifying counties and
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities population by the state's
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
total population
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the allocation factor is set at 40
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
percent so i also gave you
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
what the change
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the fund would be let's say
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
you're reading are you referring to the
 
02:13:45.199 --> 02:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
you're reading are you referring to the
amendment

02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
yes and what part of the amendment
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the first part
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh for section two
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
secretary it would be helpful if she
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
gave us the lines dropping the line
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you paige
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
one point one eleven to fourteen thank
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the spreadsheet that i
 
02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:13.830 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the spreadsheet that i
also

02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
distributed you can see
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
population factors would be
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
in uh e
 
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
in uh e
as

02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
in column e
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
column f
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
and as you can see
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
in column
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
h and column i
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
shows the difference between what
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
the current distribution was and what
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the settlement distribution would have
 
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
the settlement distribution would have
been

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.830 align:start position:0%
been
with

02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
with
this

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.199 --> 02:15:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
so with the with the current the way the
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
current allocation formula works is in
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
column h say for example
 
02:15:14.719 --> 02:15:15.910 align:start position:0%
column h say for example
um

02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
um
belmont

02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
received

02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
hundred and 2315
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixty eight cents but with
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the new allocation factor that this bill
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
proposes they would have received six
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
thousand one hundred seventy five
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
dollars and fourteen cents and that
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
would go for their
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
so this the new allocation factor also
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
take it it removes this population
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
penalty that we talked about during the
 
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.709 align:start position:0%
penalty that we talked about during the
hearing

02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
so column h is current
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
column h is the current
 
02:15:53.679 --> 02:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
column h is the current
uh

02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
this is one distribute this is one
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
settlement the mckinsey settlement
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
the settlement distribution in column h
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
is what was distributed from that
 
02:16:06.239 --> 02:16:08.149 align:start position:0%
is what was distributed from that
settlement

02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
had this
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill hp 1565 been
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
the column i would be what those
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
entities would have received
 
02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
entities would have received
instead

02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
instead
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
and as you can see it's significantly
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
but yet we're still leaving a million
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
two hundred and ninety two thousand
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
eight hundred twenty nine dollars in the
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
fund which is a significant amount of
 
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:36.549 align:start position:0%
fund which is a significant amount of
money

02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
so if any other municipalities wanted to
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
apply for grants for from this fund
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
through the opioid commission
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
then you know there's certainly a a nice
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
pool of money for these other
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to draw from
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
so the total settlement was
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
two million seven hundred sixty two
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred ninety four
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
dollars from the mckinsey settlement
 
02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
dollars from the mckinsey settlement
and

02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:09.190 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:11.509 align:start position:0%
 
only

02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:17:11.519 --> 02:17:13.030 align:start position:0%
only
uh

02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
what is it 414
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
234

02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:21.660 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry that's what's left over yes
 
02:17:34.319 --> 02:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's what's left over yes
so

02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that there the opioid
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
commission's sitting on a lot of money
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that could have been
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
distributed out to the entities that
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
could have used it right away and
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
instead it's just sitting there
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'm so that that's
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
part one part of the um
 
02:17:54.479 --> 02:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
part one part of the um
amendment

02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:17:56.479 --> 02:17:57.349 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
the other part of the amendment
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
adds in um
 
02:18:02.479 --> 02:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
adds in um
the

02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
part where that says the county nursing
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
home supervisor a designee that's his
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
page two line five
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
county nursing home supervisor or
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
designee appointed by the new hampshire
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
association of counties instead of the
 
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.270 align:start position:0%
association of counties instead of the
governor

02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
and um we're adding in another um
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
in lines 13 to 16
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we're supporting evidence-based
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
prevention programs and services
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
including efforts to promote healthy
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
drug-free lifestyles reduce isolation
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
build skills and confidence
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
and facilitate community-based
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts
 
02:18:40.559 --> 02:18:42.629 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts
so

02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:42.639 --> 02:18:43.910 align:start position:0%
so
basically

02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment is just cleaning up
 
02:18:48.629 --> 02:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
calculation language
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's really the the major thrust of
 
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.469 align:start position:0%
that's really the the major thrust of
this

02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:54.479 --> 02:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
this
questions

02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.389 align:start position:0%
questions
representation

02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.270 align:start position:0%
uh
first

02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
our chair likes to have
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
engineering diagrams
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
show where the money is going and i
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
think that this would be a big help for
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of us
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
just boxes saying okay the money this is
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
the money that came in from the
 
02:19:22.479 --> 02:19:23.509 align:start position:0%
the money that came in from the
settlement

02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:19:23.519 --> 02:19:24.469 align:start position:0%
settlement
on

02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
this portion went to the advisory
 
02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
this portion went to the advisory
council

02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
this went to
 
02:19:31.439 --> 02:19:32.389 align:start position:0%
this went to
each

02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
each
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
town by this formula and would go by
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
that other formula
 
02:19:37.359 --> 02:19:38.309 align:start position:0%
that other formula
on

02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.519 --> 02:19:44.709 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that would make it a lot
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
but
also

02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
the way i
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
the one town in 12 cities that signed on
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
to this agreement which mine didn't
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
because they have the same theory i do
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
um it turns out i found out
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
they on
 
02:20:17.359 --> 02:20:18.710 align:start position:0%
they on
are

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
are
um

02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
they are triple dipping
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
they get the money from the count their
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
money from the county they get their own
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
money and then they can can go after
 
02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.950 align:start position:0%
money and then they can can go after
grants

02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:31.910 align:start position:0%
grants
and

02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
every other
 
02:20:33.439 --> 02:20:34.630 align:start position:0%
every other
town

02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:43.670 align:start position:0%
is
getting

02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
one dip
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
instead of three
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
and um believe me my town has major
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
opioid problems
 
02:20:53.359 --> 02:20:54.630 align:start position:0%
opioid problems
but

02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
our city manager
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
signed that handshake with whoever was
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
on it i don't know but he was
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
and he
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh felt that
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
the neighboring towns around us also
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
have major problems which is true
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
and the talent on the major
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
just about every town in this state has
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be touched by it
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
management whatever that group is called
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
to talk to us about what they're doing
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
and why they haven't done much yet if
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
they haven't done much yet
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
and what they're planning on doing
 
02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
and what they're planning on doing
because

02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
we're kind of
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
dealing out a statewide
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
approach to this and it'd be nice to
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
know what we're
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
exchanging it for
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
may i request that uh our
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
county manager from sullivan county come
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
and talk about the issue of double or
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
triple dipping
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
so that he can clarify that that may not
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
be that the case
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
we can okay we'll do it right now okay
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
all right thanks mr chair uh derek
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
ferland the sullivan county manager i
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
guess in response to the the perception
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
that there could be triple dipping
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i can speak for sullivan county and
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
say that with the programs that we run
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
at the county
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
they are completely
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
distinct from whatever programs the city
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
of claremont
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
which is in sullivan county
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
would use these funds for so the city of
 
02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:02.230 align:start position:0%
would use these funds for so the city of
claremont

02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
will not be accessing the funding that
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
sullivan county would receive so there's
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
no double dip from that perspective
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
as far as whether or not the city of
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
claremont may or may not or even
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
sullivan county for that matter
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
take its distribution and still apply
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
for grant funding well that's a matter
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
for each entity to decide based on the
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
programming that they have
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
obviously that process is separate and
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
is establishing the rules about how
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
entities might apply for those funds and
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would factor in
 
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:36.389 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would factor in
um

02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
whether they whether that entity already
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
received a distribution or is one of the
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
entities that was not part of the of the
 
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
entities that was not part of the of the
litigation

02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's really up to them uh i guess it
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
would all be needs based or at least i
 
02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
would suspect it would be impart needs
 
02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.550 align:start position:0%
would suspect it would be impart needs
based

02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
based
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned during the testimony the
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
decision to join or not was a very very
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
low threshold
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
each entity had to make its own mind up
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
as far as whether they wanted to join
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
and they had about a 15 month window to
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
do so so
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know that any
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the 23 entities should be necessarily
 
02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.550 align:start position:0%
of the 23 entities should be necessarily
penalized

02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
penalized
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
because of the other subdivisions that
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
decided not to join but the issue of
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
double dipping i think is is um
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
is really a non-issue because each
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
county has its own programs that they
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
need to support and fund whether or not
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
they would partner with either
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-profits within the county or even
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
the municipalities is is i think a
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
matter that's best left to them
 
02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:31.990 align:start position:0%
matter that's best left to them

thank you
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
on is it not true that
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
the way you're doing this the city of
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
claremont's population gets included in
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%

what we've got is a hundred percent of
 
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:52.870 align:start position:0%
what we've got is a hundred percent of

municipalities
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
getting separate money out of this
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
distribution and all of it has to add up
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
to another hundred percent
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it it's requiring
 
02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.150 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it it's requiring
that

02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the city of claremont or the city of
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
belmont or whichever
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
be in their population be included again
 
02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:30.150 align:start position:0%
be in their population be included again
in

02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
the waiting for the county
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's included in the county's waiting
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
and it's included in its own city
 
02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:42.309 align:start position:0%
and it's included in its own city
waiting

02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative that's essentially
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
the population penalty that was as as
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
the original legislation essentially
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
deducted municipal populations from the
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
county shares
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
and because we each have our separate
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
and distinct
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement programs and activities
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that we
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
sought to remedy with this proposed
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
sullivan county's programs
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
um do include a lot of people from the
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
city of claremont it's it's relatively
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
proportional with our inmate population
 
02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.710 align:start position:0%
proportional with our inmate population
therefore

02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
therefore
the

02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
the drug abuse programming
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
that we offer
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
needs to account for that population if
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
it was deducted
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
but the city of claremont's population
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
is counted at 100 percent well they get
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
the full amount for their programming
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the county share is we thought
 
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
unfairly reduced by that population
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
again that's why we had to change the
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
math and the formula which i think was
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
simplified with the amendment
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
um but but the premise was
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
this population penalty is is punitive
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
in that it only affects the counties but
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
the counties have their own programs
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
that are separate from the
 
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:58.710 align:start position:0%
that are separate from the
municipalities

02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you but this is a population
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
penalty isn't it
 
02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
penalty isn't it
on

02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
on
only

02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you accept we accept
 
02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
if you accept we accept
the

02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
your conclusion that
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
you are the forefront of the opioid
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
problem in new hampshire
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
instead of the opioid problem being
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
universal across new hampshire
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
and affecting places like littleton and
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
i presume say i don't know did salem
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
sign up for this they're not only cities
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
seem to have been approached
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to who was approached like
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
i said there was a 15-month plus window
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was the information was was
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
publicly available
 
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
publicly available
um

02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm not i'm not going to
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
make a value judgment about whose
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
programs are more important i can i can
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
simply say that from a dollar
 
02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
simply say that from a dollar
perspective

02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the programs that we run in our
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
county jail
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
very confident that they would dwarf
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the municipal programs would be
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's medical medically assisted
 
02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
whether it's medical medically assisted
treatment

02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
the clinicians and the case managers
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
that we have that actually provide
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
the in-house
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
treatment services on a daily basis
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
those are expensive
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
i think they're all important i think
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
the front lines are in multiple
 
02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
the front lines are in multiple
um

02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
locations whether it's in the city a
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
town or even a county
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
but there's no denying that the county
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
programs are significant and they are
 
02:28:31.439 --> 02:28:32.469 align:start position:0%
programs are significant and they are
costly

02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
costly
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i just think that the
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
fixing this population penalty as we
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
dubbed it
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
is a critical component and i think it's
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
a fair and reasonable way of of
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
distributing these funds to have the
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
biggest impact most directly
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions if not thank you
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it if you
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
have any other questions please
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
feel free to contact me via email
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh mr buffett do you have anything to
 
02:29:12.399 --> 02:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
uh mr buffett do you have anything to
say

02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
triple

02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
triple
 
02:29:21.359 --> 02:29:22.389 align:start position:0%
triple
so

02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:22.399 --> 02:29:24.070 align:start position:0%
so
sure

02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh i'm happy to do that and i should
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
also say that i'm a member of the
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
commission the opioid abatement
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
commission to the extent that there are
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
the process and where we are i'm happy
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
to uh answer those um for the record my
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
name is james befetti i am an associate
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.910 align:start position:0%
so um
the

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
the population penalty that that they
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
just referred to
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
i would actually call it a double
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
counting of people
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the original bill
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
you don't want to count people twice
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
because that gives an unfair advantage
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
to those counties that had more
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions who
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh who joined
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you can't get to a
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
hundred percent so for example
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
both the city of nashua and the city of
 
02:30:15.359 --> 02:30:16.710 align:start position:0%
both the city of nashua and the city of
manchester

02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
um hired contingency free counsel
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
and filed lawsuits
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
so if you did this distribution formula
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
and you did not deduct the population
 
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
of manchester and nashua then you would
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
count those people twice because you
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
would count the population of
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county total
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then you would and then you would
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
give them um per person uh some
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
distribution formula 15 is what the is
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
what the current law says
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
and in addition you would count them
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
again to give an additional 15 by
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
population to nashua and to
 
02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
population to nashua and to
manchester

02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
so those counties that had bigger
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
communities who
 
02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.070 align:start position:0%
communities who
filed

02:31:02.070 --> 02:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:04.070 align:start position:0%
filed
lawsuits

02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
those those those populations of those
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
communities were deducted from the
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
counties to be fair to everyone else in
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state it's not
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a population penalty it's it's
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
a protection against double counting
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
people so
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
some counties like rockingham
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
rockingham only had a couple of
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
communities that that hired contingency
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
free council to file these lawsuits
 
02:31:30.399 --> 02:31:31.190 align:start position:0%
free council to file these lawsuits
so

02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at in that first
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
distribution for that mckinsey
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
settlement the county that got the most
 
02:31:37.359 --> 02:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
settlement the county that got the most
money

02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
was rockingham because
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
they had only a few communities in the i
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
think it was just derry in londonderry
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the entire
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
county of rockingham that filed all the
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
other political subdivisions in
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
rockingham county including exeter and
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
plaistow uh
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and any of the other communities
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
who didn't file
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
because they didn't they wouldn't have
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
qualified for that 15
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
so the county ended up actually
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
benefiting because there were fewer
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
communities that had uh had had hired
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to speak to the to this
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
issue about the work of the commission
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
helpful i know representative army had
 
02:32:27.359 --> 02:32:28.469 align:start position:0%
helpful i know representative army had
questions

02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a question for
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
you or for the
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor who handed out this chart
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
have you seen this chart i have not
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay um maybe helpful if if he did
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make sure
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
the grand total population is one point
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
three one six
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
two nine two fifty six
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh i i wanna know
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
again maybe it's not a question for you
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
i can ask if you don't mind mr chair
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
so let's take the hillsborough example
 
02:32:58.080 --> 02:32:59.030 align:start position:0%
so let's take the hillsborough example
and

02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
and
manchester

02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
so when we have the hillsborough
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
population 2010 census
 
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
in this chart
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
is that really the hillsborough census
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
or is it the hillsborough census minus
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
manchester and or in any other
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh town that could be in hillsborough
 
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:18.630 align:start position:0%
uh town that could be in hillsborough
here

02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i would i would have to look at this
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
chart and compare it to the chart that
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
we use for the distribution i don't
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
think i'm not sure i have one of those
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
with me
 
02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:29.190 align:start position:0%
with me
um

02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
i could certainly get that to the to the
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee fine uh we'll be having a work
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
session next wednesday okay
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
um and i can i could certainly provide
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
that ahead of time um which shows uh so
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
it shows that my chart that shows the
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
population of each county based in the
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
2010 census
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
and then it shows the populations of
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
those subdivisions
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
that had filed these lawsuits and it
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
deducts that and so then you get two
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
figures you get the the the starting
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
figure the for the population of
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county and then you deduct
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua's population and
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
then you get the the population figure
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
for the remaining part of
 
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
of of hillsborough that is used for the
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
distribution formula okay which which
 
02:34:19.590 --> 02:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
i guess we have to
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
check the numbers uh with these new
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
numbers to make sure that that's the
 
02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
numbers to make sure that that's the
case

02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
but that's your position though that yes
 
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't double count right so the
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute actually says
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
that the population of any political
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision that receives funds under
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
the section shall not be included in the
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
population of the county for determining
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the distribution of that county that was
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
put in precisely to avoid the unfairness
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
of double counting
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
represent

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
tucker yes i uh live in coast county
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.190 align:start position:0%
and i'm
have

02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
been concerned like all representatives
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
about the opioid crisis not only in
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
coast but in grafton
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a major problem of not
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
having any detox
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
facility in colas county
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the one that was supposed to have
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
one in grafton
 
02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
one in grafton
uh

02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
in the central part of the state
 
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't either
 
02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't either
so

02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
are these monies you talk about programs
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
but without detox
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
someone who has reached the decision
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
that they're ready for treatment
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
can't get into any of those programs
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
so i'd like really to hear that address
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
does this include money for detox
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that someone who believes they're
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
ready for help
 
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:52.830 align:start position:0%
ready for help
can

02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
qualify or are you
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
doing detox in the jails by just not
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
if there were proposals for treatment
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
facilities in different parts of the
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't have a lot of
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities and cross county is
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
one sullivan county is another part of
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state that doesn't
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
and there were proposals to have
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
 
02:36:23.439 --> 02:36:24.469 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
so

02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
in in looking at the the treatment the
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
long-term treatment of opioid use
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
so detox is a very small part of it but
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
but it's key but i'm not well it's it's
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's key to a certain point and i'm
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
not sure that you need residential
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
treatment the science seems to indicate
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
that a lot of this treatment can happen
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
at home in uh in certain situations the
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
most effective treatment for opioid use
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
disorder is is medical assistance
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
treatment drugs
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
like suboxone
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's proven that because of the nature
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
of an opioid addiction which is not the
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
same as other kinds of addictions
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
because it changes brain chemistry
 
02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
so opioids do something different to the
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
person and the the addiction that is
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
created is overwhelmingly powerful i was
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
a public defender for 14 years i dealt
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
with many many clients who were addicted
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
to opiates
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
many clients and i would talk to them
 
02:37:32.399 --> 02:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
many clients and i would talk to them
about

02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
what is this addiction like and they
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
would describe this craving that never
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that is so powerful which is why
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes an opioid
 
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.110 align:start position:0%
oftentimes an opioid
treatment

02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
relapse is such an important part of it
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
because it it happens a lot that craving
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
never goes away one of the most
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
effective ways of doing it is through
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
drugs like suboxone
 
02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
drugs like suboxone
um

02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's so it's not just a matter of
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
putting him into a a treatment facility
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
without oftentimes without this a system
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
this this this medical assisted
 
02:38:07.359 --> 02:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
this this this medical assisted
treatment

02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
um it's not going to be successful so
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of stuff that we need to
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
make sure we're providing access to
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
to everyone in the state and so in some
 
02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:19.349 align:start position:0%
to everyone in the state and so in some
cases

02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a need for
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
transportation services for people who
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
are having a hard time getting to a
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
nearby uh uh treatment facility
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the current the current statute
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
would provide that as an appropriate use
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
of these funds
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we so and just in terms of
 
02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
um you know we so and just in terms of
this

02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
of where this is
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
this opioid abatement commission which
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
is a wide-ranging commission made of of
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
state uh local county
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh treatment uh providers uh it's a
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
broad range commission um
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
we we've successfully
 
02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh approved rules we did that a few
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
months ago um we're now waiting for
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
gelca to act it's scheduled i think for
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
the next month or so
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes that has delayed uh this this
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
putting out the money but um but as
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
initial as an initial figure out how
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
actually

02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
fairly distribute the money and the
 
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.190 align:start position:0%
fairly distribute the money and the
statute

02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
would would uh require that so we've
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
done it we've we've put together rules
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
they've been approved by the commission
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
they have been they've been uh sent to
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
gel cow we're hoping that we get uh
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
that approved so that we can distribute
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
this money once those rules are approved
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
my expectation is that this money as it
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
will be going out on a really a fairly
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
frequent basis the rules actually say
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
that when there's there's at least 500
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
000 in that trust fund that we need to
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
invite grant applications so we can
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
start getting that money sent out and so
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have 2.3 million i mean frankly it's
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
a it's you know somewhat of a
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
frustration that hasn't been able to go
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
out before but we have to work within
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
the structure of law and structure of
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
government and this is how we we do
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
things things in an organized way so the
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
expectation is that as we get money and
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to get money at least for
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the next 18 years
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
if this settlement that we're about to
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
to finalize with the three major
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
distributors gets approved then we
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to turn this money around
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
quickly and it would be available to
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
to any political subdivision in the
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
state not just to those 23 political
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions who happened to hire
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
contingency fee council
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and filed a lawsuit
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
and and and i can let me say this again
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
now there's a there's a there's a a
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
question of profound fairness here right
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
these 23 subdivisions are now saying
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
that they are entitled to
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh extra consideration for this money up
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent of the money
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh because they were litigating
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that's the that's the whole
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
justification in the law they were
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
litigating subdivisions
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
they never litigated anything
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
never and so there is no dispute there's
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
no factual dispute that they never
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
litigated anything they filed complaints
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
that went into federal court in
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
cleveland ohio those complaints have
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
been was stayed
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
nothing happened to them there was no
 
02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
litigation whatsoever
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
so how do you say that that justifies
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
them getting 40 percent
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
to the exclusion of the other political
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in the state
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
that that didn't which includes you know
 
02:41:58.230 --> 02:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
hudson and merrimack and bedford and and
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
and durham and all of these towns that
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
also have their own
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
opioid problems everyone every political
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision should have an equal say now
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
we agreed to give 15 percent to those
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
litigating subdivisions as a compromise
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
but to increase it to 40 percent or more
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
i just think there's a there's a
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
question of fundamental fairness
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
and which is why we've opposed the bill
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
we can get into more details in the work
 
02:42:31.359 --> 02:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
we can get into more details in the work
session

02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
if we get
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
what i
 
02:42:37.269 --> 02:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
really want to do is
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
what is the kind of information there
 
02:42:39.279 --> 02:42:40.469 align:start position:0%
what is the kind of information there
what

02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%

yes uh most of you don't know me my name

02:42:59.190 --> 02:42:59.200 align:start position:0%

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
tucker's
question

02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
this this spreadsheet is very heavily
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
weighted toward population numbers
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the impact of
 
02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the impact of
opioids

02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
opioids
is

02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:20.389 align:start position:0%
is
not

02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
evenly divided uh
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
across the state based upon population
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
that the actual
 
02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
that the actual
prescriptions

02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
that were applied
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
are heavily weighted toward rural areas
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
which would certainly include
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
colossal county and some of the other
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
rural areas
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that was that those
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
areas did not have
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
the availability
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
of other
 
02:43:54.399 --> 02:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
of other
less

02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
opioid heavily weighted
 
02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:00.070 align:start position:0%
opioid heavily weighted
pain

02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
pain
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't have what for instance
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
physical therapy available to them so
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
opioids was prescribed
 
02:44:13.190 --> 02:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
more heavily than perhaps someone in
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
my county of hillsborough county that's
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
why for instance the state of west
 
02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.550 align:start position:0%
why for instance the state of west
virginia

02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
virginia
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
which is a very rural
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
state as a whole
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous opioid problem
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
so i would and i don't anticipate being
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
back here on the committee but i would
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee members
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration and any
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
time that
 
02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
time that
that

02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
monies are being divided out
 
02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind that
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
sullivan county and grafton current
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
county in colossae county
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
the impact of opioids
 
02:44:58.319 --> 02:44:59.190 align:start position:0%
the impact of opioids
is

02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
is more
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
horrendous in those counties
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
way beyond what a population chart would
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
seem to suggest
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you for for uh
 
02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
so thank you for for uh
that

02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
anybody else
represented

02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:21.349 align:start position:0%
represented
morphy

02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
morphy
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my question and i
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your passion about
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
the fairness of the distribution of
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
these monies which i think is critically
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
important because
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
from a clinical perspective there is a
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
opioid addiction that is not even we are
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
not aware of
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
so because you filed a suit does not
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
mean that you have a greater proportion
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
of people addicted so my question to you
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
in preparation for next week do you have
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
available to you a breakdown
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
geographically through the state of the
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
numbers of cases of patients or people
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
involved with opioid addiction
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
because it goes beyond just the
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
population numbers that you're referring
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
to it also goes to specifically getting
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
the dollars to those that deserve it and
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
need it and so it would be helpful for
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
us to understand
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
exactly the distribution throughout the
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
state beyond 23 entities
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative i i
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
let me talk to uh to somebody at dhhs
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
and they have folks that are doing that
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much of that is
 
02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
reported so that the state would have
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
access to the number of patients who are
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
reporting substance use but they may
 
02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
have some sort of geographical data
 
02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:37.429 align:start position:0%
have some sort of geographical data
that

02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
may be helpful
 
02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
may be helpful
um

02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
but but so but that's exactly why this
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
the current system which has not even
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
yet been been put into place
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so effective because it
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
precisely because it it it can it allows
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
us to address the needs in other s
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
sections of the state that are not
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
affected by population and so that the
 
02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
commission can say well you know there
 
02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
are problems in sullivan county
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that need to be addressed
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
their needs uh because of lack of of
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
treatment resources for instance may be
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
greater we need to take that into
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
consideration even though it's a smaller
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
county we need to take that into
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
consideration and it allows the
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
commission to direct the funds in in
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
ways that it's going to have the most
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
effect for for the people of new
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire to address the opioid crisis
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
follow mr
 
02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
follow mr
follow

02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate that because i have
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
asked the hospital association because
 
02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
they really don't have the ability to
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
dig down deep into where all the
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
patients come from in their catchment
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
area it would be helpful if dhhs had
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
some more accurate um
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
numbers about the distribution or the
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
the spread or the where these patients
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
or where these people are i i will
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
certainly ask uh thank you provide
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
whatever i can
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:04.070 align:start position:0%
for other questions
representing

02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
this very brief
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
sequel to that on they may have numbers
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
only by hospital and
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
my hospital will be seeing people over a
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
wide area so that would not be helpful
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
thanks representative romney so we're
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about rsa 126
 
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
con 84.
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
so what i just want to make sure i
 
02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:36.469 align:start position:0%
so what i just want to make sure i
understand

02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
this is what created
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually 80 sections 83 to 86.
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
okay but yeah three six okay
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh follow up
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
miss chair
 
02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:49.830 align:start position:0%
miss chair
so

02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
in that original statute
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
was was there any formula prescribed or
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
the formula was supposed to be
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
the commission no it's so it's an
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually the formula is in 126 a 83
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
section 2 which has the formula um
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
about how the 15
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
would be distributed to those litigating
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh and it mentions the 2020
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
the 2010 census and it has that language
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
i talked about about not double counting
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
so in the chart that we were handed that
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
mckinsey settlement
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
first are we just talking about mckinsey
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
settlement or going forward other
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
settlements so this would apply to all
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
settlements that came in mckinsey is the
 
02:49:33.279 --> 02:49:34.150 align:start position:0%
settlements that came in mckinsey is the
first

02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh and only at this point settlement of
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
opioid funds that the states receive so
 
02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
there was that 15 distribution that that
 
02:49:44.309 --> 02:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
my office made to those
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
litigating subdivisions under the
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
statute and then the remaining money
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
um is in the opioid uh abatement trust
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
fund so but there will be
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh there will be
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh settlement funds i predict coming in
 
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
for at least 18 years over different
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
periods of the time over over those
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
years uh and you know upwards of
 
02:50:10.230 --> 02:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
150 or so million dollars that will come
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
into the state that will be used and has
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
to be used for opioid abatement purposes
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay and mr chair so that so then
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
that 15
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
would apply to those counties or
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
or towns or cities that signed on to any
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
other future litigation
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
yes it would yeah and yeah so and they
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
didn't sign on to anything what they did
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
was they they agreed to hire contingency
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
fee council national contingency fee
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
council who filed on their behalf
 
02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:40.389 align:start position:0%
council who filed on their behalf
lawsuits

02:50:40.389 --> 02:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
all those lawsuits went to federal court
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
and were consolidated in the federal
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
court in cleveland so they haven't
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
signed anything they just hired
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
national council to to file these
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuits on their behalf okay and this
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
one more this is real final so what's
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
before us
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a bill that wants to for the mckinsey
 
02:51:01.359 --> 02:51:02.389 align:start position:0%
is a bill that wants to for the mckinsey
settlement

02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
push nope for all sediments push it
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
above the 15 percent yeah so uh that so
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the the the
 
02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
mckinsey money was already distributed
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
under this current formula so any
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
any settlements any any settlements to
 
02:51:21.429 --> 02:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
come into any entity in the state any
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the state itself to any city town
 
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
county has to go into the opioid trust
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
fund before that
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
then a certain percentage would be given
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
to the litigating subdivisions
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
and so essentially
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you would say we're
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna change it from 15
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
to i think i have to look at the latest
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
draft of 40
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
of that would go to those just to those
 
02:51:45.359 --> 02:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
of that would go to those just to those
23

02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and hired outside counsel
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
to represent them okay
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
no i'm clear thank you thank you
 
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
if not uh
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
this will even make it more juicier come
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
wednesday can i ask what what what time
