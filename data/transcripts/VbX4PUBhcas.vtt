thank you very much mr chair mr speaker
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm here to urge you to vote against the
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on hr 17 a resolution
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
opposing all federal state efforts to
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
establish a carbon tax on fuels for
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
electricity and transportation
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
our congressional delegation cares a lot
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
about we do in concord three of them are
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
in fact former state legislators the
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
fourth is a former lobbyist
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
and they but they do know better than
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
pay much attention to house resolutions
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of them will change
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
the votes in carbon taxation or any
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
other issue just because the speaker
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the house that would be you mr
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
speaker forwards a copy and i'm sure
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
will be nicely formatted of of this
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
house resolution
 
00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:08.230 align:start position:0%
house resolution
and

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
hr 17
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
is especially irrelevant because it's
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
ill-informed i would especially like to
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
highlight the last warehouse although i
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
think all of the i think there were six
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
warehouses i
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
think all of them were were false except
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the first one which is a rather
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
banel observation that it's good to have
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
lots of electricity
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
anyway the last whereas is the sole
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of the tax code should be to
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
fund necessary government functions
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
rather than manipulate consumer
 
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.389 align:start position:0%
rather than manipulate consumer
decisions

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion that's not true at all
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging desirable decisions and
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
discouraging undesirable ones is a it's
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
a legitimate function of the tax code
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
and this statement is also inconsistent
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
with just about every tax policy we have
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
debate we have here in concord
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
including the like where we have at
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
least one about a tax cut later today
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
where every proposed tax cut is always
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
promoted as this incentive for getting
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
more of something or other which we want
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
more of
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
similarly although tax increases here in
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
concord are almost unthinkable when they
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
happen occasionally but you know it's
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
supposedly almost unthinkable
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
they can legitimately serve as an
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
incentive for getting less of something
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
we want less of
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
and and of course also this proposed
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
carbon taxes um there's several
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
proposals none of which have gone far in
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
congress would actually raise quite a
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
bit of revenue too but
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
anyway reducing fossil fuel consumption
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
is a desirable goal for many reasons um
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
just to name a couple
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
first of all there's a finite amount of
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
oil and gas on the earth we're going to
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
run out at some point we're not going to
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
run out of
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
wind or solar but we will run out of oil
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
and gas at some point it's often located
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
in convenient places such as vladimir
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
putin's russia
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
also fossil fuel consumption causes an

immense amount of pollution including
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
but not limited to greenhouse gases such
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
as carbon dioxide and
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
and just to say where i'm coming from
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
yes i do believe that uh
 
00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:07.509 align:start position:0%
yes i do believe that uh
greenhouse

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
greenhouse
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
global warming that global warming is a
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
problem but those first supply even if
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're not worried about global warming
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
um it's also untimed i know gas taxes
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
are double what they were two years ago
 
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
are double what they were two years ago
but

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
two years ago demand was at an all-time
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
low because no one was driving or flying
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere because there was nowhere to go
 
00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:27.669 align:start position:0%
anywhere because there was nowhere to go
to

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
demand is back to normal now but now the
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel supply has been disrupted
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it will be disrupted for quite some
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
time by the russian ukrainian war
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
a minute ago i referred to putin's
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
russia referring of course to vladimir
 
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
russia referring of course to vladimir
putin

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
putin
 
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.789 align:start position:0%
putin
and

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
you know he yes he is a madman
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
but he's a madman motivated in part by
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
his desire to take advantage of
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
ukraine's fossil fuel resources it's a
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly significant fossil fuel
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
producer russia is one of the largest
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
producers on the planet
 
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.509 align:start position:0%
producers on the planet
and

00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.470 align:start position:0%
and
also

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically the only source of income that
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
russia has right now is oil and gas
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
revenues so like
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
he's paying for this disastrous war in
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
part by selling oil and gas to the west
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
and reducing fossil fuel consumption was
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
a desirable goal even in peacetime
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
but it's even more desirable now during
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
a time of war and
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is a time of war
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
so anyway please vote no on the ought to
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
pass motion to h.r 17
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that an alternative motion may be
 
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
so that an alternative motion may be
considered

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative welcome
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker i arise
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this theoretical ban on
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
all carbon pricing h.r 17 came to the
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
state federal committee because the
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
resolution includes banning the federal
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
government from imposing any tax on
 
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
government from imposing any tax on
carbon

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
i would like you to oppose h.r 17 it's a
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
bad out of state polluter idea it's bad
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire citizens
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's bad for our businesses economy and
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
our future the public opposed it
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
149 to 4 in the committee hearing
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
at first glance you might say hey any
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
car any tax is bad so a carbon tax must
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
be bad too
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
the inter the energy innovation and
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
carbon dividend act which is making
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
making its way through congress is an
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
example of legislation which would be
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
theoretically banned this is a federal
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
border adjusted cash back carbon fee on
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel fuel production including
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
attacks on foreign producers
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
economic analyses show that it will
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
bring cash back to most new hampshire
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
citizens except for big corporations and
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
people who fly around in in private jets
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
most economists including milton
 
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.470 align:start position:0%
most economists including milton
friedman

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
friedman
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
agree that this type of carbon pricing
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
is critical towards reducing our
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
reliance on fossil fuels
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
carbon assessments are made at critical
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
choke points for example the points at
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
which foreign producers of oil or gas
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
create the fossil fuel when they put the
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
gas when they put the oil in a barrel
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
for example the eu canada and other
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
nations are adopting these types of
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
levees but if we can't reciprocate
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
it is americans and american businesses
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
that will be hurt explicit carbon
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
pricing is the only climate policy that
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
enables us to protect u.s businesses
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
while holding other countries
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
accountable for their pollution if this
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
resolution is adopted it will hurt not
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
help most new hampshire citizens so the
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
next question that we have to ask is do
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
we need to reduce co2 resulting from
 
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.150 align:start position:0%
we need to reduce co2 resulting from
pollution

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's a report that just came out a
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
few days ago by the united nations
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed line by line by over 200 of the
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
top scientists from around the world
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
they press code red
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
and as you should press the red button
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
on this one they press they
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
they press the code red button on co2
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
emissions from fossil fuels we're simply
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
at a critical point in history but h.r
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
17 says otherwise don't worry everything
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
is okay we're going to be fine and yet
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
not one scientific organization in the
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
entire world not one scientific
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
organization in the entire world claims
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
that co2 does not present a clear and
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
present day danger
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
i was born at 347 parts per million co2
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're now at 420 parts per million co2
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
and rising global temperatures are
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
rising not going down
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
my neighbor charlie deloz who i just
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
spoke to the other day has been a new
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire farmer and gardner his whole
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
life his father was a state rep from
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
hancock a republican back in the 60s
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
charlie knows the climate is changing he
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
sees that the lilacs are blooming three
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
weeks early
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
he sees that the sap is starting early
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
and isn't running into april
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
he knows that tick-borne illnesses are
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
on the rise that there are cardinals
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
flying around at a weird time of year he
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
also knows that humans are contributing
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
to this problem
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
if we can all agree that pollution is
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
bad that humans are creating pollution
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
and that pricing carbon is a way out why
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we agree that it is our
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility as parents grandparents
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
stewards of the state to vote against
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
this really bad resolution h.r 17
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
suggests a bad that is unreasonable i
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no red button we can we
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
must do better
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer of minority to speak
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources suffer from two
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
significant problems
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
one they are not cost effective for base
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
load power
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
two they are not dispatchable
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
meaning the sun is not always shining
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
there is night there's clouds there's
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
rain there's snow there's fog
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
the wind doesn't always blow
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
or it blows too hard

viability of renewable sources of power
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
this concept is fiscally bankrupt

all you need to observe is the

disastrous impact of the current

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
it is the major contributor to

tremendous fuel and electricity price
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
hikes we now see
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
this policy is effectively a carbon tax
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
and our citizens do not need an
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
expansion of that pain
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
advocates propose to mitigate the pain
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
by repeating rebating the tax to it to
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
i only ask you
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%

growing financial debt the lock box was
 
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
growing financial debt the lock box was
broken

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
broken
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
we are so lucky we don't have a

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%

know that h.r 17 would hurt most of our

increase the cost of gasoline

increasing the cost of these fuels
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%

i would like to provide a human context

to the issue before us

are operating a shoestring school for

of haiti
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
sadly your efforts have come to the
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
attention of criminal elements
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
they killed one of your friends
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
they kidnapped you
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
and then they tried to demand the ransom
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
you were able to escape
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
and flee
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
but as the practice for the criminal
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
elements in this country
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
in order to keep them from being
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
discovered by police
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
they will then come and try and kill
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
you the person who escaped as well as
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
the friend who they tried to get the
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
ransom from
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
or imagine
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
if you are an afghani
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
or perhaps in the near future
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%

legally
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
i wish i repeat legally
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
you decide to live in new hampshire
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire you're required
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license after 60 days
 
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license after 60 days
however

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
without a work permit you are not
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
qualified to get that driver's license
 
00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:58.150 align:start position:0%
qualified to get that driver's license
yet

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
asylum seekers will automatically
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%

after

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%

365 days
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
if they have
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
had their if they have not had their
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
asylum hearing and i point out that
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
asylum hearings take years before they
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
get to them nowadays
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
this bill simply closes the gap
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
between arrival and the issuance of the
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%

and obtaining a temporary new hampshire

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't know maybe it's me
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the two million plus people
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
that cross the border last year that are
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
causing the delay
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
the caravan after caravan specifically
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
designed to overwhelm the system that
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
are causing the delay
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
simply put mr speaker when the federal
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
government starts enforcing their
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
immigration laws then perhaps we can
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
look at changing ours
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
until then please support the committee
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues if i know
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
that it is our obligation as

representatives to try and fix the
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%

people who live in this state
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this is just a

believe the current law is sufficient
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
and if i also believe that we have no
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
obligation to change our laws because
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government chooses to ignore
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
theirs then would i now press the green

1302
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1302 would revise rsa 266 17
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
to prohibit law enforcement from
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
stopping and weighing non-commercial
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles that may be over their
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
permitted weight capacity
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
if passed the bill will take away a tool
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
for keeping our roadways safe without
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
solving any current discernible problem
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
under current law a law enforcement
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
officer may stop a commercial or
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicle and weigh the
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle the officer may employ a
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
stationary or portable scale or direct
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
the driver to a nearby public motor
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle scale within 10 miles
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1302 would restrict that
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
authority to commercial vehicles only
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
this bill raises potentially significant
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
public safety concerns
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee heard
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from the new hampshire
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
department of safety division of state
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
police regarding the risks caused by
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
excessive vehicle weight which may
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
require police intervention
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
for instance a vehicle's braking ability
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
and steering effectiveness are subjected
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
to a greater failure under stress from
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
excess weight
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
tires can blow out from heightened t and
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
pressure that come with excess weight
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
in other words an overloaded pickup
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
truck headed to the town landfill or
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
transfer station can represent a greater
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
risk than just loose debris flying off
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
even though the driver may not intend or
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of such risk
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
the same is true for a family minivan
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
headed home from home depot overloaded
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
with house project supplies
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
while the majority suggests that the
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
current law is obsolete we heard
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony from the state
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
police that the current law is necessary
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to educate drivers
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of driving overloaded
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles not just to impose citations
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
importantly probable cause is already
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
required to justify stopping and
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
weighing a non-commercial vehicle
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
indeed these vehicles are rarely issued
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
citations for exceeding weight capacity
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
the committee heard testimony from the
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
department of safety that such stops
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
have only occurred approximately six
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
times in the last five years and a
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle must also be at least 20 percent
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
over capacity to be given a citation
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is that house bill 1302 will
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
make it harder for law enforcement to
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
keep drivers safe both drivers have
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
overweight vehicles and drivers sharing
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
the road with them without evidence of
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
any benefit
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are already rarely
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
stopped for exceeding weight capacity
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
officers must have probable cause for
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
i have subsequently learned after
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee hearing from the department of
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
safety that should the federal highway
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
administration determine our law or
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
procedure does not comply with federal
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
standards we risk losing millions of
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in federal public works funding
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
as most recently occurred in 2013.
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
the dangers of breaking or steering
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
failure or blown out tires on the
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
highway are ones and we should and can
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
seek to mitigate to protect everyone on
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
there is no testimony as to how this
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill would help residents or why it is
 
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
bill would help residents or why it is
necessary

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
i ask that you oppose the majority
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation of otp on hb 1302 and
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
push the red button so that another
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
motion may be made
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative steven
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
so what this bill is about is how you're
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
prosecuted not what the violation is
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
it deals with overweight
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
after the bill is passed you can still
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
get an overweight ticket what you can't
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
do is be ordered to drive 20 miles to
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
help them prosecute you that's just
 
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
help them prosecute you that's just
insane

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
insane
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
so mr speaker i looked up your uh
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
your rev and it can hold 985 pounds
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
so if me and three of my buddies need a
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of you probably don't know what
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
your vehicle is rated to carry now when
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
you give us that ride if an officer
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
thinks that a bunch of us look
 
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.589 align:start position:0%
thinks that a bunch of us look
suspicious

01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
suspicious
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
and we might
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
he can pull you over and then have you
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
drive up to 10 miles to some scales to
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
see if
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
his suspicion that you're overweight is
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
correct that's wrong
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles sure it's a
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
condition of their operation they have
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
to go out meet certain regulations a lot
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
of them are federal regulations but this
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
is about your passenger vehicle did you
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
know if you have a half ton pickup truck
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
let's say a crew cab so it's got a back
 
01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
let's say a crew cab so it's got a back
seat

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
seat
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
half ton you put five 200 pound adults
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
in that you can't put a bag of potato
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
chips in the bed without being
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
overweight i bet a lot of you didn't
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
and you didn't mean to break the law and
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
you could get a ticket but you shouldn't
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
be required to drive 20 miles to assist
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
the prosecution so that's all this bill
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
does doesn't touch commercial vehicles
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
you can still get an overweight ticket
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
now we we did hear well what about you
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
know the crazy guys they go down to home
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
depot and they have stuff loaded in the
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
back with a forklift
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
those things have weights on the bags
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
so if you have 20 50 pound bags of
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
anything they had a wicked good sale on
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
garden stone and you went nuts you're
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
still getting your ticket
 
01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:02.390 align:start position:0%
still getting your ticket
so

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's improper search and seizure
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
they can make you drive that's wrong you
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
can still get an unsafe load what about
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
the scrap guys they're probably going to
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
get an unsecured ticket there's a
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
million ways to write a ticket we asked
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
the police they said yes they can do
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
please pass the bill and stop this
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
ridiculous search and seizure that makes
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
you do a 20 mile round trip to help him
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
write a ticket
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker

that are blatantly operating above their
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
safe load limits is an important tool

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
know that the department of safety
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
testified that if they had reason to
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe a non-commercial vehicle was
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
overweight they would not make them
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
drive to a scale because it's unsafe
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
they would not waste the time bringing
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
their portable scales there because it's
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
not worth it they would actually ask
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
them to relieve the load there which
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
makes this current law unneeded if i

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
first some background on why this is so
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
our highway fund that builds and
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
maintains our state roads highways and
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
bridges is solely reliant on federal
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
funds as well as our own gasoline tax
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of every gallon of tax gas
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
includes a 23 cent tax which goes into
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
our highway fund to pay for the
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance of our
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
transportation infrastructure now
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
consider that over the last two decades
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
new vehicles are seeing fuel efficiency
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
like never before a gallon of gas that
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
used to move a car 17 miles is now
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
moving that car over 30 miles nearly
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
twice the road usage but with the state
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
collecting that same 23 cents now add on
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
that top of that the growing number of
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
fully electric vehicles on our roads
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
that pay nothing into the highway fund
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
as our vehicles become more advanced and
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
efficient we are seeing less revenue
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated crisis that needs to
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
be tackled not only here in new
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire but nationwide
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended prevents the
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
sharing of vehicle mileage with any
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
public authority authorized to enforce
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle tax laws without the
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
consent of the vehicle's owner lessee or
 
01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
consent of the vehicle's owner lessee or
renter

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
renter
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
this would give a driver the choice to
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
opt out of having their mileage usage
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
shared thereby letting them decide if
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
they pay their fair share for wear and
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
tear on our roads what could possibly go
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
wrong with that
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
this morning on the other side of the
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
wall hb 1040 is on the consent calendar
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
after passing the house on a voice vote
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
in february 1040 establishes a
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
commission to study revenue alternatives
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the gas tax and the future of road
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
funding where undoubtedly this issue of
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
mileage usage will be vital to the
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
discussion and this bill right here hb
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
1401 if passed is going to complicate
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is not just a new hampshire problem
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is a nationwide problem a few weeks
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
ago when we voted on cacr 32 nearly all
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
of us agreed that new hampshire is at
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
its core a fundamental part of something
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
bigger we are not an island and we
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
mutually benefit from being a state in
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
this union and because of that we have a
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to not pass hb 1401
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
how we fund our roads at both state and
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
federal levels needs to change gasoline
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
has been the one constant for more than
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
a century but that has changed and we
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
need to approach the problem carefully
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and deliberately
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
one of the possible tools we need in our
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
toolbox is mileage usage and hb 1401
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
takes that tool and locks it away so we
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
can't use it i ask that you vote no on
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
the committee report about to pass as
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
amended so that is granite staters and
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
as americans we can attempt to solve
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
this complex and multi-faceted problem
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
of funding our infrastructure and have
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker

mr speaker in 2018 80 of our state's
 
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
mr speaker in 2018 80 of our state's
voters

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
voted at the ballot box to adopt a
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to our constitution article 2b
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
it states that an individual's right to
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion in
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
natural and essential and inherent
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
and so building off of that mandate from
 
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.110 align:start position:0%
and so building off of that mandate from
our

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
our voters we need to put those things
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
in the statute and so this bill is one
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
small attempt to put
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
privacy over personal information in
 
01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:01.830 align:start position:0%
privacy over personal information in
statute

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
while at the state at the same time
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
sending a message to the federal
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
government that we're not interested in
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
new tax schemes for our our state's
 
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
new tax schemes for our our state's
citizens

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the 1.2 trillion dollar bipartisan
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill there is a pilot
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
program to
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
enact a nationwide mileage tax
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill this very short bill
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
would prevent
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
our state's inspection stations and the
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
department of transportation from
 
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.669 align:start position:0%
department of transportation from
revealing

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
revealing
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
the mileage
 
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
the mileage
usage

01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
usage
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
of our state
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
drivers to an outside taxing authority
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is so short i'll just read it
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that that'll i'll wrap it up there
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any provision of the law
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
to the contrary no information relative
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
to the mileage of a motor vehicle shall
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
be shared by the department or an
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
inspection station with any public
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
authority authorized to enforce motor
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle tax laws
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the vehicle's
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
owner lisi or renter
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
for purposes of this paragraph public
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
authority shall not include any entity
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
representing the state of new hampshire
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
so the state of new hampshire is free to
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
explore adopting a mileage tax if that's
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
something that we want to do here
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't interfere with any business
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
operations such as a company called
 
01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
operations such as a company called
carfax

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
carfax
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
or other companies like it that rely on
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle mileage data much of it not tied
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
to an individual
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
so please vote green to pass this and
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
tell the federal government that we're
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
not interested in their their pilot
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
has requested a division this will be a
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
jim osborne has requested a roll call is
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
that sufficiently seconded it is
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
the motion before us as the majority
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
report of water passes amended on house
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill 1401
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
doleski for a parliamentary inquiry
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that as a state and
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
nation we need to tackle the challenge
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
of how we pay for our roads and highways
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
and that the long-established tax on
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
gasoline no longer spreads the burden
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
equally on all users and isn't providing
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
the necessary revenue and if i know that
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
hb 1401 will prohibit the use of mileage
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
as one component of a multi-faceted
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
solution to the highway funding crisis
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that another bill on the way to
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%

and what it does not do
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
first what the bill does
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill will set up provisions to test

provisions such as this in their state
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will add to the efforts

license
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
now in preparation for my arguments
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
i was reminded of a song
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
sung by paul simon
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
50 reasons to leave your lover
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
well there may be 50 reasons to leave
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
your lover
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to give you three main
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill needs to be itled
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
first this bill prohibits the sharing of
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle information
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
to be shared to federal immigration
 
01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
to be shared to federal immigration
services

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
such as ice
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
and protection agencies
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
so if they suspect there's someone here
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
who is here illegally or undocumented
 
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
who is here illegally or undocumented
illegally

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is this bill prohibits the sharing
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.199 --> 01:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
integrity of elections
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
i disagree with my esteemed colleague
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
who says this has nothing to do with
 
01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:51.669 align:start position:0%
who says this has nothing to do with
voting

01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
in testimony it was brought out
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
that oh no these these licenses aren't
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to be used for voting
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
but let me ask you how many times have
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
you gone to vote and you presented your
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
license did they do a scan of that
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
license to see if it was legitimate or
 
01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
license to see if it was legitimate or
not

01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
a license is a legal document
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
what this will do will open up the lack
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
of integrity at our elections
 
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.390 align:start position:0%
of integrity at our elections
because

01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
you cannot guarantee that a hundred
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
percent of the people will not use this
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
lastly

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
and probably the biggest reason it's
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to create a sanctuary state here
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to take
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
the meeting of bienvenue new hampshire
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
to a whole new meeting
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
so in closing
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
i ask you to support the committee's
 
01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
i ask you to support the committee's
recommendation

01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
by pressing the green button
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is a majority
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:51.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.280 --> 01:32:01.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative sykes for
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%

colleagues
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
if i believe that
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
one of the primary directors of
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
our service as legislators is to provide
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
for better public safety
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
and that this bill accomplishes that by
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
proving that people who are driving in
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
this state now can drive because they've
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
taken a test both a written and a
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
practical exam
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that it is the right
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the people who live in
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%

thank mr speaker
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill the
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
stop corporate welfare act of 2022
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
is this body's first effort to stop
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
large profitable corporations from
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
receiving roundabout subsidies from
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid and food stamps by paying their
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
workers low wages if i know that the
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
mere introduction of this bill's sister
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill the stop bad employers by zeroing
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
out subsidies or bezos act of 2018
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
was enough to make amazon raise their

starting wage to 15 bucks an hour
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
if i know that frustration with
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare is so bipartisan that
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
it is probably the single issue where
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
myself the cato institute and even fox
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
host tucker carlson see eye to eye
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
and if i know that ending corporate
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
welfare would increase wages while
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
saving taxpayer dollars would i now vote
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
red so a different motion can be made
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
jay i recognize representative bernstein
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the complex and
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
nuanced factors that drive real and
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
sustainable wage growth are best left to
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
the invisible hand of the marketplace
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
not the ham-handedness of legislative
 
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.430 align:start position:0%
not the ham-handedness of legislative
fiat

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
fiat
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i'm aware that hb 1478
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
would disproportionately harm low margin
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
labor labor-intensive businesses such as
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and retailers
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i believe that
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
when considering the constitutionality
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
of hb 1478 in the context of part 2
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the new
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution regarding equal
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
and proportional tax rates
 
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.229 align:start position:0%
and proportional tax rates
well

01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
to be frank mr speaker let me put it
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
this way
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
if i believe that the love child of
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
oliver wendell holmes and nadia kamanich
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
could not perform the legal gymnastics
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
required to present a coherent
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument for this bill
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button and
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
support the eighteen to one bipartisan
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
majority of the ways and means committee
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%

01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%

01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
may sound good
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%

01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
even if it were

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee heard
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
testimony in regards to the underlying
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
issues which would have impacted one
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
county to a great deal
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
while no sponsors of the purported
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
legislation were willing to have their
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
community bear the expense and tasks in
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
the committee agreed that while the
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill in regards to
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
elections is something to be looked at
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the future but it was not sufficient
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
should i now press the green button to
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
muller for our parliamentary inquiry
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i know this legislative body is
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
tasked with ensuring that our election
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
process is properly vetted secure
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
entrusted by our voters and that the
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's report that
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
documents unverifiable voters who cast
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
ballots in the 2020 election using
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits in lieu of proper residential
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
or personal identification is nearly a
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
year late
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
in being released to the attorney
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%

general's office for further
investigation

02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that information was
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
presented to the election law committee
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
that indicated our state had a statewide
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
statistically improbable voter turnout
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
rate of 92 percent during the election
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
and that two canvas towns had a phantom
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
voter rate of approximately 10 to 15
 
02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.390 align:start position:0%
voter rate of approximately 10 to 15
percent

02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that there were a number of
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
questionable votes cast from memory care
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
elder facilities and if i know if we
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
believe our election process procedures
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
to be secure accurate and reliable then
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
we should be eager to perform a limited
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
audit so we can provide our citizens
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
with verifiable data rather than just
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
empty platitudes about our feelings
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
regarding election integrity
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know the sponsors of this bill
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
were happy to work with the members of
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
election law committee and readily
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
provided them with a smaller
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
more manageable a la carte list
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
weeks ago at their request of
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
towns and counties across new hampshire
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative this is a parliamentary
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry yes sir
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that i actually
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
told a person on the election law
 
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.310 align:start position:0%
told a person on the election law
committee

02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
that if it has to be my town it has to
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
be my town because i care about election
 
02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:07.189 align:start position:0%
be my town because i care about election
integrity

02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that our voters
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
deserve a proper up or down vote from
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
each of us on a more appropriate motion
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that we are abdicating our
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility by hiding behind a
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
tabling motion then would i now press
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
the red button so another motion can be
 
02:07:23.599 --> 02:07:24.790 align:start position:0%
the red button so another motion can be
made

02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is a tabling motion
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote if you're in
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
favor you'll press the green button if
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
you approach you'll press the red button
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:12.270 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:25.430 align:start position:0%

02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%

opportunity to vote also attend the
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%

members will stay in their seats we've
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
got one person speaking and then

a division is now
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
being requested
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative administration

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
enact the attorney enact the attorney

02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
providing that the attorney general be
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
elected by a majority vote of the
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
members of the general court in a joint
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
session consider the same report the
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
same with the following resolution
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
resolved that is inexpedient to
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislate senator janet wall for the
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee chair recognizer
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative silber to speak against
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the citizens of our state
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
have enabled
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
the 424 members of general court
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
to elect the secretary of state
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
and the nonpartisan nature of those
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
elections has been shown
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
for many many years where
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
a well-known democrat has been elected
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
by those 424 members as secretary of
 
02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
by those 424 members as secretary of
state

02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
so this is really a non-partisan issue
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
the present time the attorney
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
general contrasted with the 424 people
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
who vote on the secretary of state
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
voted into office by
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
four people
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the head of the legislative branch and
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
at least three members of the executive
 
02:10:41.199 --> 02:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
at least three members of the executive
council

02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
if the process
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
for the selection
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the secretary of state
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
is good enough
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
for the general court to do it
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
should it not be good enough
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
for our attorney general the chief law
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer of our state
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the general court needs to reassert
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
its long neglected primacy
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
as set forth in the state constitution
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
we are a co-equal branch their
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
but the legislative branch really should
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
have primacy
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and it's been neglected for many many
 
02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.109 align:start position:0%
and it's been neglected for many many
years

02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's time to change that
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
we need this constitutional amendment we
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
need to take control of who our attorney
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
general is going to be i urge you to
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that another
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
report vine expedia to legislate on
 
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.390 align:start position:0%
report vine expedia to legislate on
cacr24

02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
cacr24
 
02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.159 --> 02:12:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%

motion on cacr25
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the cacr simply creates a 15-term term
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
limit on each body of the general court
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
15 terms means
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
30 years that is a long long time
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
after 30 years of serving in this house
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to run for a house
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
seat again
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
but you could run for state senate and
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
serve another 30 years if you so choose
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
this cacr allows for that
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
now i thank
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
taken the time out of their lives to
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
serve this their communities and this
 
02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
serve this their communities and this
state

02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
by passing the caacr we give the people
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
of the state an opportunity to say yes
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
or no on the idea of term limits
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
we should let the people determine what
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
they want it is not up to decide this
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
issue but for them because this is their
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%

party-list proportional representation
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate presenter

02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker honorable colleagues i rise
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
today against the committee
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
on cacr 26
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
providing that a hundred of the
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
representatives are elected using
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
party-list proportional representation
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
let me first start by explaining what
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
party of this proportional
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
representation is
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
partyless proportional representation is
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
an electoral system that accurately and
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
proportionately represents the partisan
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
will of the people
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
if a party receives 25 of the vote then
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
they shall receive 25 of the seats in
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
this is done by allocating seats based
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
on a predetermined list of candidates
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
chosen by the voters such as in a
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
primary election
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
take germany for example
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
in germany you vote for your local
 
02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
in germany you vote for your local
representative

02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
but you also vote on a separate section
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the ballot for which party you agree
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
with most
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
those results are taken and the seats
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
allocated accordingly
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
this leads to more parties being
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
represented in their legislature
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
this makes it significantly harder for
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
parties to win outright majorities and
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
leads to the need for parties to build
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
coalitions to govern
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
this obviously leads to more cross-party
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
cooperation and less division in
 
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
cooperation and less division in
government

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why maybe party-less
 
02:25:19.349 --> 02:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
proportional representation is the
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
solution to ever creasing
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
increasing partisanship and division in
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is why i ask that you join me in
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl motion and press
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
the red button so that we can have a
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislature that acquire accurately
 
02:25:33.359 --> 02:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
legislature that acquire accurately
represents

02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
represents
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
motion before and i request a division
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
vote sorry
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is inexpedient to
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislate on cacr 26 a division has been
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.399 --> 02:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.960 --> 02:27:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
clearly

02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the motion of
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
any speeding to legislate on cacr 26.
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the united
 
02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:26.790 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the united
states

02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire are
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
facing increasing levels of negative
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
partisanship in political division
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the cacr simply makes
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
it a requirement that 100 out of the 400
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
representatives shall be elected through
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
party list proportional and that the
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
cacr is intentionally vague so that
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent legislation could decide what
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
type of party list proportional would be
 
02:27:47.439 --> 02:27:48.389 align:start position:0%
type of party list proportional would be
used

02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
if i know that these lists would be
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
chosen by the voters in primary
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
elections and representatives would be
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
elected similarly to floaterial
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
districts and finally if i know that
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
over 37 percent of registered voters do
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
not fit in into either major party would
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
i now press the red button and give the
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire greater choice
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
in their elections thank you
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative hill for
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the committee
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted to deny the suggestion
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
that one-fourth
 
02:28:26.309 --> 02:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the house of representatives should
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
be chosen not by our neighbors and
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
friends but by party leaders from their
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
list of acceptable candidates
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
and if i know this scheme just seemed to
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
be too complicated and yet incomplete
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
to spring on the general public
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%

02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
or they just resign or pass away in
 
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.630 align:start position:0%
or they just resign or pass away in
office

02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
the only way a judge can be removed
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
is by
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
impeachment and in the history of our
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
state the entire history of our state
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
there have been two
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
impeachment actions
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
one of which in the 1700s which was
 
02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
one of which in the 1700s which was
dropped

02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
the second one in 2020
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
in which the judge was impeached by the
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
house and acquitted by the senate
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
many of us
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
presumably have heard from constituents
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
over the past year or two
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps longer
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
about complaints about how they have
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
been treated
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the courts
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.319 --> 02:32:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
while most of our judges are very wise
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful public servants
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
because we've heard from many com many
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
complaints from constituents
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
you really we really need to have some
 
02:32:31.439 --> 02:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
you really we really need to have some
mechanism

02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
to remove a judge
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
where there is a groundswell of
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to their continuity in office
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
separation of powers
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
and the checks and balances in our
 
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:45.510 align:start position:0%
and the checks and balances in our
system

02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
among the greatest strengths of our
 
02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:48.710 align:start position:0%
among the greatest strengths of our
system

02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
and the three branches of governments
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
should serve as a check on each other
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
once again the general court i urge the
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
general court needs to reassert
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
its intended primacy
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
and eliminate the effective virtually
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
unlimited control of the judiciary by
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
the executive branch of our state
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
by pressing the red button
 
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
to kill the itl motion so another motion
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
can be brought forward and i asked for a
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
silvers had requested roll calls that
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.479 --> 02:34:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the inexpedient
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
on cacr 27 this is a roll call vote
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative silver
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that many
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
of our citizens would like to have an
 
02:34:33.359 --> 02:34:34.469 align:start position:0%
of our citizens would like to have an
opportunity

02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
to mount a recall provision
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
and if the constitution permitted it
 
02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:40.309 align:start position:0%
and if the constitution permitted it
under

02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
procedures to be dictated by the
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
legislature and subsequent legislation
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
if i know that 19 states and the
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
district of columbia
 
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
have recall provisions including states
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
like california where judges have
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
justices of their supreme court have
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually been recalled by
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
petition recalls
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button so that
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
another motion can be brought forward
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
jay i recognize the representative
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
if i know that technically the cacr is a
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
bit flawed as it references article
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
96 to be amended and actually amends
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
article 73
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
that there is no process in this cacr
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
it says it is quote to be determined and
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
quote on how the judges shall be removed
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
and by the way by some
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
future legislature
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and if i know that many states
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
that elect
 
02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
that elect
officials

02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
and elect
 
02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
and elect
judges

02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
judges
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
allow for recall
 
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
of elected officials
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
but do not allow recall
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
of judges
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the state if i know that in the state
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we do appoint our
 
02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:13.830 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we do appoint our
judges

02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
judges
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm not certain how recall
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that this cacr
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
puts elected judges
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
in a position
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
of an unpopular or unpolitical decision
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
of a potential recall
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
would i vote with the majority
 
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.670 align:start position:0%
would i vote with the majority
unanimous

02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:42.550 align:start position:0%
unanimous
vote

02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
of legislative administration and vote
 
02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:46.870 align:start position:0%
of legislative administration and vote
green

02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%

02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
the you before us is the inexpedient to
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%

an act relative to persons elected to a

local board serving on another board
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
having considered the same report the
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
same with the recommendation that the
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill be referred for interim study sent
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
a richer trip for their committee
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative teresa
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise today to speak against
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the interim study motion
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
of for house bill 1155 which is relative
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
to persons elected to local boards
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
serving on another board
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
under current law any ex-officio member
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
appointed by a town's governing board
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
to a budget committee or planning board
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
or an ex-officio appointed by a school
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
board to a school budget committee
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
becomes a full voting member of the
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
other board
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
without actually being elected to that
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
board essentially giving a governing
 
02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:18.070 align:start position:0%
board essentially giving a governing
board

02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
a kind of super majority
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
why is this a problem
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
because under current law you cannot run
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
for local office
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
for two competing boards for example
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
joe moneybags
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
wants to run for both his town's
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen and town budget
 
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:37.270 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen and town budget
committee

02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
he's not allowed to do that because
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict of interest to serve
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
on both those boards
 
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
but instead joe moneybags runs for just
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
selectmen he wins his election
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
and then gets appointed as an ex officio
 
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the budget committee
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
now he can serve as a full mo voting
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
member of both
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
both boards
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is inconsistent in a loophole
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
because the conflict interest is still
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
there and he also gets to vote twice on
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
a town's budget
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
once with the board of selectmen and
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
again with the budget committee in
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
effect getting a second fight at the
 
02:40:09.359 --> 02:40:10.309 align:start position:0%
effect getting a second fight at the
apple

02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
apple
 
02:40:12.309 --> 02:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this is like the new
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire house getting a vote on the
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
same bill here in the house and again
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
with the other body behind us
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
or even worse members of the other party
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
getting a second vote with us
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
last week we heard debate on house bill
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
1455 relative to state enforcement of
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
federal vaccine mandates we heard the
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
importance of the 10th amendment with
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the concept of balance of power between
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government in states
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
we passed this bill because it was the
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and i believe the
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
senate has already passed it as well
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
so the same concept applies here
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
what this legislation
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
will simply do if we pass it would be to
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
change the ex official position to a
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
non-voting position that's it
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
the ex official will still serve as
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
their role as a liaison between between
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
the governing
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
board and other
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
board that they are appointed to but the
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
balance of power will be leveled
 
02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
improving accountability of government
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of senate bill 2 when it was
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
passed was to allow towns
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
with municipal budget committees to have
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
an equal say
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the city or town budget process
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the budget committees are
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
elected by the people to protect their
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
interests as taxpayers and to act as a
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
check on the governing body of the
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
municipality in schools
 
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
another problem under the current system
 
02:41:36.790 --> 02:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
the ex-officio member often misses
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
several meetings in the associated
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
debate research and background data used
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
by the rest of the committee as a basis
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
for determining the best vote on line
 
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
items and total budget decisions
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
but then
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
comes to public hearing to vote for the
 
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
full budget the way the governing body
 
02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:53.830 align:start position:0%
full budget the way the governing body
suggests

02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
without being completely informed on
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
these details mr speaker for these
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
reasons passing house bill 1155 would
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
restore the checks and balances
 
02:42:03.269 --> 02:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
eliminate the conflict the current
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
conflict but it would still retain the
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
ex-official members to the committees
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
assigned retaining the expertise
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
communication between the bodies this
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
would be no different than the full
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
house committee and subcommittees we
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
have here in the house hearing testimony
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
from many expert witnesses that
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
contribute their vast knowledge and
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
wisdom that help the
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
us make informed decisions
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
without them actually getting a vote
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
in summary this is common sense
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that provides a fair
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
balance upholds one person one vote
 
02:42:34.399 --> 02:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
balance upholds one person one vote
concept

02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
concept
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and gives local residents more
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
accountable government
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
so please join me and press the red
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion can be
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
made and help poor old joe he's already
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
overworked thank you mr speaker ask for
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
a division vote has been requested
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're on the final speaker members will
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
return to your seats chair recognized
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative van for speak for the
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
um i am urging you to support
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
the interim study because there is
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of statute out there which
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
concerns membership on various boards
 
02:43:15.279 --> 02:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
concerns membership on various boards
also

02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
the proposed solution makes assumptions
 
02:43:20.319 --> 02:43:21.269 align:start position:0%
the proposed solution makes assumptions
about

02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
who's elected where and how the overlap
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
works which are not universal every town
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
does this differently
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
well this may have some merit and maybe
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
we should think about whether all of the
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
overlaps that are currently happening
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
are in the best interests of the
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
citizens that we did not have enough
 
02:43:43.279 --> 02:43:44.550 align:start position:0%
citizens that we did not have enough
information

02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
to know whether this bill was going to
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
do that or not
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that you support
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
the interim study and maybe next year
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be back with a better bill thank
 
02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.190 align:start position:0%
we'll be back with a better bill thank
you

02:43:59.190 --> 02:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
is a committee report of interim study
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1155 this is going to be a
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%

02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
interim study report on h.b one one five
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative true
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%

official member
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
one person one vote
 
02:45:37.590 --> 02:45:37.600 align:start position:0%

02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
believe that the policy committee
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
report 17 to one believes that with
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
additional study we might be able to
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
reconcile some of the problems with this
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill and mr speaker if i believe that
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are at least three rsas that need
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and six subsections of
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
those rsas that need to be addressed

a true bill
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
a bill that will affect the
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and political subdivisions of
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
now why do i say this is a truly
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
tax payers bill
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
let's walk with me a little bit of the
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
history because you have to do this to
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
completely understand but i will be
 
02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.309 align:start position:0%
completely understand but i will be
brief

02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
brief
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
but in 1967 when he came up with the
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
nhrs the new hampshire retirement system
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
the state promised
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
in perpetuality
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
to pay 35 percent
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
combined systems you got to remember at
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
that time there were four completely
 
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
separate groups and they combined it
 
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
into two group one and group two thirty
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
five percent originally it was forty
 
02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
percent but was dropped down to thirty
 
02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:09.429 align:start position:0%
percent but was dropped down to thirty
five

02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
that continued until two thousand and
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
ten at two thousand and ten
 
02:51:17.910 --> 02:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
there was a great roll back by supported
 
02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
by this house
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
that brought it down eventually from 35
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
percent to zero
 
02:51:25.359 --> 02:51:26.150 align:start position:0%
percent to zero
now

02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
where did that contributions go
 
02:51:31.269 --> 02:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
it didn't vaporize
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know what you did
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
you wrote it right back to each
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
municipality and political subdivision
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
in in a way you created a tax
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that is paid
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
by each municipality
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
now this bill
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
definitely affects each
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
city and town
 
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
and this particular state
 
02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you have one teacher
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
one firefighter or one police officer
 
02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
that belongs to the new hampshire
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
retirement system you are paying
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
that 35 percent
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
into the nhrs
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's coming out
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
of your municipal budget
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
and thus starving your municipality your
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
city and town
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
of what they could normally do with that
 
02:52:24.399 --> 02:52:25.349 align:start position:0%
of what they could normally do with that
budget

02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
now from what i understand there's money
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
within this state and maybe it's time to
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
look at it now i went to the finance
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
hearing and i heard many of the
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
architects that started this process in
 
02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:39.910 align:start position:0%
architects that started this process in
2010

02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
2010
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
but let me give you for what i have
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
learned and let me give you the usual
 
02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
learned and let me give you the usual
caveats

02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
caveats
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes i am a member of the new hampshire
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
a member of the national fire department
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
for 35 years and retired
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
i am also a member of the city of nashua
 
02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen and i serve currently
 
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
as vice president of that board and i am
 
02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
also on the budget committee so i have a
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
fair idea of what i'm talking about but
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
what has happened now
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
reneging on that original
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
1967 idea
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
has cost let's say an example of nashua
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
an additional 2 million dollars
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
now again i hear
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
that the state is i want to say rolling
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the dough but there is money to look
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
at this and there is money to come back
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
and to bring up the original obligations
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
and that original obligations was paying
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
35 percent
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
now we're not asking for the full 35
 
02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:52.950 align:start position:0%
now we're not asking for the full 35
percent

02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
we're asking for 7.5 percent
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
i feel
 
02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's a compromise
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's a fair and equitable way to look
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
at this particular issue
 
02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:08.469 align:start position:0%
at this particular issue
now

02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
your cities and towns
 
02:54:14.230 --> 02:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
many of you
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
belong to or if you have
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
served as i do besides being the state
 
02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
served as i do besides being the state
rep

02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
you serve on your local town boards this
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
has the backing of the new hampshire
 
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
municipal associations
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
you may have received emails from your
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
school boards you may have received mail
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
from some of your city fathers
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
that are trying to tell you to support
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of finance very close
 
02:54:44.070 --> 02:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
with the 11 to 10.
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
i don't find that as any mandate
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact my personal
 
02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:50.550 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact my personal
recommendation

02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
is to bring this and vote positively so
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
we can go to the next level over to the
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
people that exist behind the wall
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
but you gotta understand what i heard in
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:04.950 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
is

02:55:04.950 --> 02:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
something counterintuitive i heard from
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
the architects that brought this
 
02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:11.349 align:start position:0%
the architects that brought this
cutback

02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
cutback
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
02:55:15.429 --> 02:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
and i've always lived by the political
 
02:55:15.439 --> 02:55:16.710 align:start position:0%
and i've always lived by the political
role

02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
role
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
of when you realize you're digging a
 
02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:19.830 align:start position:0%
of when you realize you're digging a
hole

02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
hole
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
the first thing to do to survive your
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
political career
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking you to stop digging
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
your cities and towns have had 11 years
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
of making up the 35
 
02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:38.710 align:start position:0%
of making up the 35
gap

02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
gap
 
02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're only asking
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
to relieve that stress
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
to seven and a half percent
 
02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
now you may not agree
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
with the combined
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
defined benefit package that's not the
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
this has to do with what your taxpayers
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i want to bring
 
02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:04.230 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i want to bring
up

02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
i will give you the example in the city
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
of nashua this will benefit the
 
02:56:12.550 --> 02:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in nashua two million dollars
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
manchester very similar
 
02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
and to your own cities in town
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
the city of lebanon four hundred
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the town of litchfield
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars almost thirteen
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars holding this
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
approximately around thirteen
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars this has an impact
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore i urge you to support this
 
02:56:38.830 --> 02:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh vote to override the itl that came
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%

representative for taking my question i
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
was here in 2010 and when we voted my
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
question to you is actually a two-part
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
didn't we
 
02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
make the employees pay two dollars more
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
into their retirement so we didn't
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
downshift and all and
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
does somebody from the state
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
sit at every city and towns bargaining
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
as they raise
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
their pay every year i mean does the
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
i thank the representative for the
 
02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
i thank the representative for the
question

02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
in 2010 when this was rolled back
 
02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
there also were other things there was
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions on the ull which was the
 
02:58:13.750 --> 02:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability well we could forget
 
02:58:17.349 --> 02:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
that the ull is not attached to this
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
this unfunded liability as a member of
 
02:58:22.230 --> 02:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
the pension system i think i speak for
 
02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
everybody that is an active participant
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire retirement system
 
02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
we want as you want a healthy retirement
 
02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:31.670 align:start position:0%
we want as you want a healthy retirement
system

02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore we support all the efforts
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
of the u uh of funding the ull which is
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
the promise by the year 2039
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
the ull will meet its
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
capacity and money will be rolled back
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
to the state maybe at that time might be
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
the better time to negotiate
 
02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
what is the fair contribution from the
 
02:58:56.030 --> 02:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
municipal city and towns but that's in
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
2039 many years away
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
which also you did is raising employees
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
compensation rate
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
such as you went from nine and
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
three-quarter percent as a police
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
so that means when you got your paycheck
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
and you went home to the wife and you
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
gave her the cash after you cast a check
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
and went out and said honey go buy the
 
02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:23.190 align:start position:0%
and went out and said honey go buy the
bread

02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
bread
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
you were
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
2.13 percent
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
in arrears just by that act that was
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
created in 2010 so to make up that
 
02:59:33.439 --> 02:59:34.630 align:start position:0%
created in 2010 so to make up that
difference

02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
what do you think the unions would do
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative yes i think you've
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
answered the question
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
well i think and i thank the chair thank
 
02:59:42.640 --> 02:59:45.910 align:start position:0%

02:59:50.230 --> 02:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to question
 
02:59:54.630 --> 02:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh it is almost lunchtime but i'm on a

uh it is almost lunchtime but i'm on a
roll

02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
roll
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
remember the member yields
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate you
 
03:00:06.230 --> 03:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i hope we'll all
 
03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
have something on a roll soon
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that back in 1967 um there
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
were there was the agreement made for to
 
03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
pay 35
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
that actually was before my time i was
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
born 12 years after that i'm curious if
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know how many private sector
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
employees had pension plans at that time
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
when they voted to when they went along
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
with this agreement to pay 35 percent
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:36.710 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
uh

03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
you kind of missed the 80s
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
and what happened in the 80s a lot of
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
people did not really work
 
03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
like they did at one time
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
like in nashua or at the car shop or

grandfather or great-grandfather
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
probably received a defined benefit plan
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
but people wanted something to travel in
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
their briefcase as they got to
 
03:01:02.550 --> 03:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
headhunter and went and traveled to get
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
different type of jobs
 
03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
different type of jobs
so

03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
i would have to say and i'm quoting
 
03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:09.429 align:start position:0%
i would have to say and i'm quoting
the

03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%

03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
regrets
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
you could take my word on this but he
 
03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:18.790 align:start position:0%
you could take my word on this but he
regrets

03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
regrets
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
inventing the 401k
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the best
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
pension plan for everybody now what's
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
the benefit of a defined benefit plan
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
the employees put the money away
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
the employers put the money away it goes
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
into a fund and they can predetermine
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
and you receive
 
03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
their cash it's better
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
than your 401k or anything like it
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
because you may skip a payment you may
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
decide to purchase the boat that's up to
 
03:01:48.319 --> 03:01:49.269 align:start position:0%
decide to purchase the boat that's up to
you

03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:51.670 --> 03:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
but it's solid when you have a defined
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
benefit program and that's
 
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
if your question is what is the
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
difference that is the difference
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the only thing left
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
the vestige of a defined benefit program
 
03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
is mostly within the public service
 
03:02:05.439 --> 03:02:08.950 align:start position:0%
is mostly within the public service
sector

03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
gerald griffin to speak for the
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
03:02:26.550 --> 03:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose hb
 
03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:29.110 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose hb
1417

03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
1417
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
hb 14 17 would have the state pay 7.5
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system contributions
 
03:02:40.230 --> 03:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
for the political subdivisions for group
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
ones and group two employees
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
the bill came out of its policy
 
03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:47.030 align:start position:0%
the bill came out of its policy
committee

03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
with an itl recommendation
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
the full house initially voted itl
 
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
it was reconsidered late in the day
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
after many members had left
 
03:03:07.670 --> 03:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it passed by the slimmest imagines
 
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
the finance committee opposes the bill
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
on multiple grounds
 
03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
the bill would change
 
03:03:17.030 --> 03:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state policy
 
03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the policy committee had rejected
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
that change
 
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of the bill is a function of
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
the number of employees of the state's
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
03:03:30.550 --> 03:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
and this
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the state has no control over that
 
03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:34.870 align:start position:0%
and the state has no control over that
number

03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
this bill would encourage hiring at the
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
local level
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
and i think we all know
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
more hiring at the local level
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
results in higher property taxes
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
the bill's current estimated cost is
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
roughly 28 million
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
in both fiscal
 
03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:00.469 align:start position:0%
in both fiscal
2024

03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
and fiscal
 
03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
and fiscal
2025.

03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
that is after our terms of office are
 
03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:09.590 align:start position:0%
that is after our terms of office are
off

03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
the state may not have the money at this
 
03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:13.510 align:start position:0%
the state may not have the money at this
time

03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly with the effective date
 
03:04:20.830 --> 03:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.030 --> 03:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
2023 passage of the bill will encumber
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
a future legislator's budget
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that is never good policy
 
03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that is something we should never do
 
03:04:38.230 --> 03:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
i ask that you join with us
 
03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is enough speeding
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%

03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
if i believe the rep from nashua that
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor of overturning the ltl
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
on 1417 got it all right
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i know that yesterday
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday state revenues exceeded plan
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
by 230 million dollars and the rainy day
 
03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
fund presently has
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
257 million dollars in it
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
knowing the state's financial situation
 
03:06:51.630 --> 03:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't i support providing a modest
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
contribution which works out to 28
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars to our municipal family
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker

03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the state has not made
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
contributions to local employers
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
retirement shares since 2012
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
due to the unpredictability of the cost
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
and if i further know
 
03:07:36.790 --> 03:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the 28 million in the bill wouldn't
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
go very far among one point three
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
million people if that makes it about
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars per person and with about
 
03:07:46.070 --> 03:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
two point five people per home that
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
might bring it up to fifty dollars
 
03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:49.429 align:start position:0%
might bring it up to fifty dollars
however

03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:07:51.269 --> 03:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
thirty three percent of the property
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
taxes are paid by businesses and 18
 
03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
percent by second homes so you cut it in
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
half again
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
about 25 dollars per person which
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
i know would quickly evaporate in the
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%

income and retired granite staters just
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
like it was in two thousand eight
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
our seniors need help
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
these people did not get their pensions
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
for nothing but rather they contributed
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
decades of their lives to our state our
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
communities and our municipalities
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
they have given so much and now they sit
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
in their homes cutting medications
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to re-up
 
04:38:30.320 --> 04:38:31.510 align:start position:0%

prescriptions

04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
visiting friends less because they can't
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
afford the gas
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
eating less healthfully because the
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
nutritious food they need costs more at
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
their age
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
they are the biggest recipients of the
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
pressures of inflation
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
wisely a bill was introduced to this
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
house which provided for a cost of
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
living adjustment for these folks and i
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
want to thank those who worked on it i
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
liked their plans so much that i voted
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
for the 1.5 cost of living adjustment
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
the first time that i came through this
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
house and passed on a voice vote i would
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
like to do it again
 
04:39:01.990 --> 04:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
there was a concern in the finance
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
committee about the cost of the bill
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
and it's true 79 million dollars is a
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
heck of a bite
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's an argument that would resonate
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
with me had this body not voted two
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
weeks ago to cut the business profits
 
04:39:14.561 --> 04:39:15.590 align:start position:0%
weeks ago to cut the business profits
tax

04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
or if the ways and means committee on
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall wasn't being
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged to cut business taxes by
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
nearly 70 million dollars i.e the cost
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the underlying bill
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
or had the business profits tax cuts not
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
been included in the 2021 state budget
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
or the triggers in the 2019 state budget
 
04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
or the 2017 state budget for the last
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
five years the state has cut hundreds of
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in taxes for the
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
best performing biggest often out of
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
state businesses who especially during
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic made massive profits as a
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
result of the upward redistribution of
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
wealth we saw where these companies were
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
the only games in town as small
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
businesses were shattered
 
04:39:52.708 --> 04:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't need more help
 
04:39:54.310 --> 04:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
yet the legislature saw fit to write
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
checks in the forms of tax breaks to
 
04:39:55.760 --> 04:39:56.788 align:start position:0%
checks in the forms of tax breaks to
them

04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
funding this cost of living adjustment
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be a fraction of the money that we
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
have thrown out in the form of corporate
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
tax breaks and even despite that
 
04:40:06.788 --> 04:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
revenues show we have the money to pay
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the 1.5 percent unless we continue
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
to give it away
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
i firmly dismiss the idea that we can't
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
afford to support seniors as we keep
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
shoveling out money in the form of
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
corporate tax cuts
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment only offers a one-time
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
payment but is insufficient in the face
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
of year over year inflation
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
a 2021 poll published by newsweek showed
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
that 80 of americans were bothered that
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
the wealthy and well-off corporations
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't seem to pay their fair share in
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
taxes i believe that's consistent in new
 
04:40:36.638 --> 04:40:37.990 align:start position:0%
taxes i believe that's consistent in new
hampshire

04:40:37.990 --> 04:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
the desire to see the wealthy and pay
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
their fair share comes from the desire
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
to fund necessary things like supporting
 
04:40:44.788 --> 04:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
our seniors
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that because i've seen
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
communities rally together to spend
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
money on things that they valued
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
like my own newfound area school
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
district who in 2021 when faced with
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
slashing school sports and programs that
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
students and parents alike valued as a
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
result of the fda school lunch
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
calculation organized and made the
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
appropriations to support those students
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
and those programs and i am making the
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
same value judgment in support of our
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
retirees and as such i'd ask the house
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
for an opportunity to vote on the
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
underlying bill without the committee
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer representative hatch to
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker good afternoon
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
honourable members
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
and first let me say that i don't
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
at all disagree with the previous
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
speaker but we are in the reality
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
reality of this world
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
house bill 1535 establishes a cost of
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
living adjustment
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
of one and a half percent
 
04:41:42.878 --> 04:41:44.230 align:start position:0%

for

04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
anyone for the first thirty thousand
 
04:41:46.320 --> 04:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
anyone for the first thirty thousand
dollars

04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
for those who have retired at least
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
sixty months prior to july 1st 2022
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
the committee received a lot of
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
testimony about the hardships many
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
retirees are having
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
in the current economy
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
but because of the 70 i believe at 72.2
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
million dollar cost
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
the committee found it not practical to
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
pass the non-budget year and that was a
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the objections when
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's resistance to open the budget
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
so what the committee voted to do
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the fact that it's a budget
 
04:42:24.878 --> 04:42:26.230 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the fact that it's a budget
year

04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
amended the bill to give retirees
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
with less than 30 thousand dollars of
 
04:42:31.040 --> 04:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
with less than 30 thousand dollars of
benefit

04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
a one-time 500 payment to help them with
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
the current conditions the thought was
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
that you know maybe they can fill their
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%

finance committee for ought to pass on
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%

04:53:24.840 --> 04:53:26.708 align:start position:0%
house bill
1552

04:53:26.708 --> 04:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
1552
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
by means of some background this bill
 
04:53:29.440 --> 04:53:30.350 align:start position:0%
by means of some background this bill
was

04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
unanimously requested by the assessing
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
standards board
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
it came out of the executive department
 
04:53:39.788 --> 04:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
and administration committee
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously again
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
and through this full house on a voice
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
vote on the consent calendar
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
as it stands now
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board exists
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
under the department of revenue
 
04:54:00.550 --> 04:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
also known as the dra
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
under that department it has no fees
 
04:54:07.030 --> 04:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
currently for certification
 
04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
nor is there government transparency if
 
04:54:13.030 --> 04:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
an assessor obtains
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
or loses
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
a certification
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
under the dra
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
such transparency is not there
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
and this was a primary reason for the
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes the board of
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
certification of assessors
 
04:54:36.080 --> 04:54:37.350 align:start position:0%
certification of assessors
within

04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
within
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensing and
 
04:54:40.878 --> 04:54:42.788 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensing and
certification

04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
that known as
 
04:54:44.480 --> 04:54:48.230 align:start position:0%
that known as
oplc

04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
the oplc currently oversees over 50
 
04:54:53.360 --> 04:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
the oplc currently oversees over 50
boards

04:54:55.030 --> 04:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
under the oplc
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
the board of certification of assessors
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be self-funded by fees
 
04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
just like
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
other boards now
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
under the oplc
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
home inspectors
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
land surveyors
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
and real estate brokers
 
04:55:21.600 --> 04:55:22.628 align:start position:0%
and real estate brokers
and

04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
transparency of certification
 
04:55:25.360 --> 04:55:26.350 align:start position:0%
transparency of certification
and

04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
decertification both
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be required
 
04:55:30.400 --> 04:55:31.670 align:start position:0%
would be required
again

04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
as with other boards under the oplc
 
04:55:35.920 --> 04:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
as with other boards under the oplc
now

04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that the board of certification of
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
assessors should not be treated
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
differently from other certification
 
04:55:46.798 --> 04:55:48.550 align:start position:0%
differently from other certification
boards

04:55:48.550 --> 04:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
two additional points
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
first when it comes to fees they will be
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
nominal with no impact on the taxpayer
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
and with regard to appeals
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
under the dra
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
an appeal process is currently described
 
04:56:04.480 --> 04:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
an appeal process is currently described
as

04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:56:05.520 --> 04:56:07.830 align:start position:0%
as
difficult

04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
and without due process
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
establishing the board within the oplc
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
will allow for a disciplinary process
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
that includes hearings
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
an appeals process
 
04:56:21.760 --> 04:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
an appeals process
and

04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
transparency for decertification
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you support this bill
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
to establish the board of certification
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
of assessors
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
where it belongs
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
under the oplc
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
by voting red
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the itl motion so another motion
 
04:56:50.550 --> 04:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
can be made
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention and mr
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
speaker while i'm here i would request a
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
division vote at the proper time
 
04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer representative leishman
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
so let me put some of the facts out
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
there with the finance committee
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
majority looked at and had concerns with
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
first of all there's no disagreement
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
with what the speaker just said
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
about transparency
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is there's a
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill senate bill 53 that
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of transparency that
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
is headed for the edna committee in the
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
next week or two
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
took no position on this bill
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
but they did reach out to me after i
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
sent an email after i received several
 
04:57:49.750 --> 04:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
emails from people questioning the
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
motives of the members of the finance
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee that supported itl
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
read briefly one part of a quote and i
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
think probably all of you have received
 
04:58:06.310 --> 04:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
this email and it disturbed me because
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the finance committee
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
like all of us here do our jobs and do
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
it thoroughly
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
so one of the assessors that wrote to us
 
04:58:16.160 --> 04:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
so one of the assessors that wrote to us
again

04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
after we held the work session and may i
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
add that nobody attended our work
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
session that was an assessor there was
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
one individual there
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
the director of the licensure board
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
and a representative from the dra that
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
took no position
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
but after i've
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
after we voted and after
 
04:58:40.868 --> 04:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
i wrote the menu the majority report for
 
04:58:42.550 --> 04:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is what was being said about our
 
04:58:44.320 --> 04:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
this is what was being said about our
actions

04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
actions
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
i find out that there
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
had to be some kind of back door
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
politicking because now it is
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
recommending itl
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
there was no backdoor politicking
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 53 would take care of the
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
transparency issue without any fees or
 
04:59:03.520 --> 04:59:04.628 align:start position:0%
transparency issue without any fees or
fines

04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
fines
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that mr speaker concludes my remarks
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the majority report
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
of an expedient to legislate this is
 
04:59:20.550 --> 04:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a division vote
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.680 --> 05:00:04.708 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.718 --> 05:00:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
clear

05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
reported in expanding the legislator on
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 111552
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote chair recognized
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative emerick for parliamentary
 
05:00:20.400 --> 05:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
representative emerick for parliamentary
inquiry

05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:00:27.910 --> 05:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
if i know that the assessors would
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
prefer to be treated like a professional
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
organization and not a subset of the dra
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that currently
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
the general fund pays all of their fees
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
for certification unlike any other

mr speaker
 
05:06:08.708 --> 05:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
05:06:14.310 --> 05:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
if i speak directly into it
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds one thing to the
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies are fetal abnormalities
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.990 --> 05:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important that we think
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
about where we are
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.750 --> 05:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
a family we have a mother a baby
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
likely other family members
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
the family is surprised at the fact that
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're concerned
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
it takes time to find out what's going
 
05:07:12.958 --> 05:07:14.628 align:start position:0%
it takes time to find out what's going
on

05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
it's not unlikely
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
that they'll be well past the 24 war to
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
when an actual decision can be made
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
05:07:30.390 --> 05:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
how do we make the decision
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
what are we actually deciding
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
and what we're deciding
 
05:07:36.240 --> 05:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
and what we're deciding
is

05:07:37.510 --> 05:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
is it okay
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
to intentionally
 
05:07:41.920 --> 05:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
to intentionally
kill

05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
kill
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
to intentionally kill it
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's no problem if the baby dies
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
during kinds of treatment for example
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things most commonly recently
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
referred to in this context
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
is twin to twin transfusion syndrome
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
first of all that's not a fetal anomaly
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
both neither the fetuses
 
05:08:12.550 --> 05:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
has any anomaly
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's a problem with the pregnancy
 
05:08:17.910 --> 05:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
we use that expression fetal anomalies
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it's mostly a self-fulfilling
 
05:08:35.840 --> 05:08:38.550 align:start position:0%
and it's mostly a self-fulfilling
prophecy

05:08:38.550 --> 05:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's a diagnosis
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the diagnosis is often wrong
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
we heard lots of testimony
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
as this year as we have in past years
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
of children
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with fetal anomalies
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
but they don't die
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
they are born
 
05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
very normal
 
05:09:06.310 --> 05:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
some with some disabilities
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
many without
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
and they live
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
they live for years or decades
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
but yet the phenomenally incompatible
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's because the baby's not a
 
05:09:26.400 --> 05:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
that's because the baby's not a
diagnosis

05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
the baby is a living
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:34.718 --> 05:09:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
if that that being the case
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
why would anyone want to make that
 
05:09:40.878 --> 05:09:43.190 align:start position:0%
why would anyone want to make that
diagnosis

05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
who makes that diagnosis anyway
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
is it the mother
 
05:09:48.240 --> 05:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
is it the mother
father

05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
father
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
no usually it's a medical professional
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
or a group of them
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
why would they make such a decision
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
why would they give that diagnosis
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
what does that doesn't diagnosis again
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
really mean when you say fetal anomaly
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
do you mean that
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
the baby is going to die
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
well we're all going to die so i don't
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
think that's it
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
do you mean it's going to
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
first of all the baby's alive
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not totally incompatible with
 
05:10:20.000 --> 05:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
so it's not totally incompatible with
life

05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
does it mean that the baby's not going
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
to survive after birth
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
well it could mean that
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean does it mean the
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
baby won't survive for
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
05:10:38.470 --> 05:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
five years
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we know
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
so i went looking for it as preparation
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
for this and you know what there is no
 
05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
definition out there
 
05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's no medical definition of what
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
this means
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
because it's not definable
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
so what happens now
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
now we open the door
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
to when any
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
well to what i want to say with medical
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
professionals and i don't want to um
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
denigrate the medical profession
 
05:11:12.080 --> 05:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
denigrate the medical profession
but

05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
there are varying degrees of um what i
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
want to call it
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
ethics within that profession
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of pressures that are
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
on them
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
pressures from people like insurance
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
companies that don't want to pay for the
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
length of the pregnancy or potential
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
complications that might arise later on
 
05:11:33.120 --> 05:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
complications that might arise later on
from

05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
people who think that
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
various conditions
 
05:11:40.868 --> 05:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
aren't worth living with
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
like for example down syndrome
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
and we see in the world
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
in countries like denmark and iceland
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
where they be proudly proclaiming that
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
they've nearly eliminated down syndrome
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
from their population
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
because they abort any baby that has
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
that diagnosis
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
and down syndrome might be
 
05:12:08.310 --> 05:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life in some cases
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
so this is where we are these are the
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
we're opening the door to killing
 
05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
children there's no reason why by the
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
way that needs to be done
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
for any female
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
abnormality at this age
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
there are options
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
the first option is often
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
even though it's not the best medical
 
05:12:37.440 --> 05:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
even though it's not the best medical
treatment

05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
like for example in the in the case of
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
twin to twin transfusion syndrome the
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
first medical option is delivery you can
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
just deliver the babies
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
now remember where we started we started
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
by the time you get to 30 weeks
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
you can deliver a baby and there's
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
virtually no
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh negative consequences that come from
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
that the babies are born normally
 
05:13:03.030 --> 05:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
and they're born and they and they live
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
just the way they would
 
05:13:04.480 --> 05:13:06.708 align:start position:0%
just the way they would
otherwise

05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
05:13:09.430 --> 05:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
but since time has gone on we're at 26
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
27 weeks maybe even later
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
when we're actually deciding whether or
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
not to do these abortions they should
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
never be done
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
just deliver the babies would be a lot
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
better off
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
but they can be done and they can be
 
05:13:22.240 --> 05:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
but they can be done and they can be
done

05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:13:26.550 --> 05:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
for practically any reason
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
because it's all in the judgment
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
of the one making the diagnosis
 
05:13:33.270 --> 05:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
for that reason mr speaker
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
i find this
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
both unnecessary
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
and harmful and i urge you to vote
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
against the amendment
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative edwards
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
to speak for the
 
05:13:44.958 --> 05:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
to speak for the
amendment

05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.310 --> 05:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you fellow colleagues i was an
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic supporter of
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
hb2 and the insertion of the fetal life
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
part of my belief in that was that by
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
waiting for the 24 week mark
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
i had been informed that all relevant
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tests could be done in time
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
so that by the 24th week the mother
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
would make an informed decision
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
on what she wanted to do about keeping
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
the baby or terminating the baby
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
now although i spent over 40 years as a
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
health care administrator i'm not a
 
05:14:32.550 --> 05:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
provider i have a lot of respect for the
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
provider community and um and so
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
as as as we left that vote and its
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
insertion in hb2 i was feeling pretty
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
good about it
 
05:14:44.878 --> 05:14:45.910 align:start position:0%
good about it
but

05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
the stories and the truths and the
 
05:14:48.400 --> 05:14:49.750 align:start position:0%
the stories and the truths and the
realities

05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
realities
 
05:14:49.760 --> 05:14:50.708 align:start position:0%
realities
came

05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
came
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
over the transom
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think most of us are aware of the
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
woman who informed us about her twin to
 
05:14:58.638 --> 05:14:59.670 align:start position:0%
woman who informed us about her twin to
twin

05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
twin
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
transfusion syndrome scenario
 
05:15:02.480 --> 05:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
transfusion syndrome scenario
where

05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
one twin it was wasting away
 
05:15:07.200 --> 05:15:08.788 align:start position:0%
one twin it was wasting away
and

05:15:08.788 --> 05:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the failing of that child was
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
increasing the risk of harm and death to
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
the other and so
 
05:15:17.760 --> 05:15:18.788 align:start position:0%
the other and so
under

05:15:18.788 --> 05:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 if if that scenario was happening
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
after the 24th week
 
05:15:25.520 --> 05:15:27.030 align:start position:0%
after the 24th week
we

05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:15:27.040 --> 05:15:28.230 align:start position:0%
we
we

05:15:28.230 --> 05:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:15:30.550 --> 05:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
would be saying no
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
to that mother and to that physician
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
that you cannot
 
05:15:38.788 --> 05:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
take the one to save the other
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of solomon choice
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
that i think government ought not to
 
05:15:44.320 --> 05:15:45.670 align:start position:0%
that i think government ought not to
make

05:15:45.670 --> 05:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
medical professionals who train
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:15:52.240 --> 05:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
we have
patients

05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
that you got to assume after 24 weeks
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
they probably would like to keep the
 
05:15:57.920 --> 05:15:59.910 align:start position:0%
they probably would like to keep the
baby

05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
baby
 
05:15:59.920 --> 05:16:01.590 align:start position:0%
baby
but

05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to make that decision
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think we need to trust
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
the process the process is
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
the physician and the patient go through
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
an informed consent process
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
that informed consent process makes sure
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
that the patient knows their
 
05:16:17.200 --> 05:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
that the patient knows their
alternatives

05:16:18.550 --> 05:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
and then that patient has an opportunity
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully with their their their partner
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
their male partner to make a decision
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
together about raising or bringing that
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
child into the world or terminating at
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
that point i don't think we should be in
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
the exam room with them when they're
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
having that conversation
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment adds
 
05:16:40.480 --> 05:16:41.430 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment adds
fetal

05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
fetal
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
anomalies incompatible with life
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
down syndrome
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
does not fall into that definition
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
allowing a back door to abortions of
 
05:16:55.840 --> 05:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
allowing a back door to abortions of
convenience

05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
convenience
 
05:16:58.948 --> 05:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
letting the medical profession
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
treat their patient at that time
 
05:17:04.080 --> 05:17:05.270 align:start position:0%
treat their patient at that time
so

05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
this is a major part of this amendment
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
i hope you can support this part of it
 
05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
and vote yes
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the other part of this we've you know i
 
05:17:13.840 --> 05:17:14.628 align:start position:0%
the other part of this we've you know i
think

05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
most of us have agreed to which is
 
05:17:17.360 --> 05:17:18.788 align:start position:0%
most of us have agreed to which is
that

05:17:18.788 --> 05:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
the original hb2 language around
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds always made it such that
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound wasn't required until
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
precision determination around the
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
24-week gestation period
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
this repeats the language that's in the
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
penalty sections up in the body of the
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.590 --> 05:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
incidental or intentional
 
05:17:47.910 --> 05:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the ultrasound
 
05:17:47.920 --> 05:17:49.030 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the ultrasound
requirement

05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a i think it's a good
 
05:17:51.120 --> 05:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a i think it's a good
amendment

05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's something that
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house can be proud of
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
if we pass it so with that mr speaker i
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:10.270 --> 05:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is on the amendment
 
05:18:12.550 --> 05:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
1209 h
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative walper is that
 
05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is not sufficiently seconded this
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:41.600 --> 05:18:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%

the motion before us
is

05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes representative
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker

testimony after testimony
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
of parents who were given diagnosis of
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
fetal abnormalities
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life who against
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
medical advice
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
have bore their children to find out
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they were fine
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.760 --> 05:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
these abortions are used across in other
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
countries to eliminate entire classes of
 
05:20:01.040 --> 05:20:02.230 align:start position:0%
countries to eliminate entire classes of
people

05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
with a now vote
 
05:20:06.550 --> 05:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
against this amendment by pressing the
 
05:20:09.190 --> 05:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative lynn for
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
know that this amendment makes two very
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
important changes to the fetal life
 
05:20:25.270 --> 05:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
protection act which we passed last year
 
05:20:27.190 --> 05:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that first the amendment
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies what was always the intent of
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
the original law
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
that an ultrasound is not required in
 
05:20:35.670 --> 05:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
every case where an abortion is sought
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
but only in those cases where there is a
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
genuine question as to whether the fetus
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
has attained a gestational age of 24
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
weeks or more and if i know that second
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment creates an exception to
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
the 24-week ban on abortion
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
for those tragic situations where a
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
medical professional determines that the
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
fetus suffers
 
05:20:58.150 --> 05:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
from an abnormality that is inconsistent
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the fetus's ability to survive and
 
05:21:00.480 --> 05:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
with the fetus's ability to survive and
live

05:21:01.510 --> 05:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
live
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the heart-wrenching decision of
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
whether to have an abortion in such
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
cases to where it should be
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the mother in consultation with her
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
husband or partner and her doctor then
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
would i press the green button so that
 
05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
these measured and entirely reasonable
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
changes to the fetal life protection act
 
05:21:21.910 --> 05:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
may be enacted thank you mr speaker
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%

regarding fetal anomalies incapable with

incompatible with life and if i knew
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it is in fact safer to induce labor
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
or do a cesarean section allowing for
 
05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%

05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
we're back to the
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
motion of autopass as amended
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative simon
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that a
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of a fetal anomaly
 
05:26:43.350 --> 05:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life is devastating
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
and heartbreaking news so
 
05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
since debate about the fetal life
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
protection act began we've been assured
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire abortion providers that
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
abortions this late in pregnancy rarely
 
05:26:57.680 --> 05:26:58.708 align:start position:0%
abortions this late in pregnancy rarely
happen

05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
and when they do
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
only because of a fetal anomaly
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
according to nhpr however there is not a
 
05:27:08.070 --> 05:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
single medical provider in the state of
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire who claims to even perform
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
abortions after twenty four weeks
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
as recently as two weeks ago sandra
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
dunacore the executive director of
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
lovering health center was quoted as
 
05:27:21.750 --> 05:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
saying that abortions aren't done after
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
22 weeks six days in the state of new
 
05:27:23.840 --> 05:27:24.788 align:start position:0%
22 weeks six days in the state of new
hampshire

05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a full week before the fetal
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
life protection act even applies
 
05:27:30.390 --> 05:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
she also said that the fetal life
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
protection act is a band with no purpose
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
other than to work backwards from
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
so actual abortion providers say that
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
the fetal life protection act has no
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
purpose and is practically speaking a
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
ban on something that doesn't even
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the fetal life protection act isn't
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
affecting actual medical practice then
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
one wi-fi against it
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
additional exceptions to this law
 
05:27:55.270 --> 05:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
um appear to have no purpose
 
05:27:56.788 --> 05:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
other than to uphold the deeply
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
ingrained conditioning
 
05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
that killing innocent children is a real
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
and necessary good
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the best solution for
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
eliminating so many of our problems
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
let me offer a less and moral less
 
05:28:08.958 --> 05:28:09.990 align:start position:0%
let me offer a less and moral less
gruesome

05:28:09.990 --> 05:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
gruesome
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
and less lethal solution
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
abortion as defined in the law is any
 
05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
procedure that will with reasonable
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
likelihood cause the death of the child
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
i believe there is a procedure that can
 
05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of fetal anomalies
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life without
 
05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
necessitating the direct killing of the
 
05:28:26.240 --> 05:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
necessitating the direct killing of the
child

05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
by 30 weeks a child has a 99 chance of
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
survival if it is born with no
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
discernible increase of long-term
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
negative health ramifications due to the
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
early delivery
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
inducing and delivering a child at this
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
stage does not fall under the definition
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
of abortion in the statute
 
05:28:45.190 --> 05:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
remember these are pregnancies where the
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
life and physical health of the mother
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
are not at an elevated risk the fetal
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
life protection act already contains
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
robust exceptions for the physical
 
05:28:55.590 --> 05:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
health and life of the mother the law
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
does not require that a mother sacrifice
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
her life or even the long-term integrity
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
of her body and its functions for those
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
furthermore late term abortions are more
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
complicated and dangerous for the mother
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
than regular birth
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
why else would every hospital in the
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
state refuse to do them
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
why take the extra unnecessary step of
 
05:29:17.830 --> 05:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
killing the child first why not induce
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
labor and give the child every possible
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
chance to live and let god determine
 
05:29:25.510 --> 05:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
what is incompatible with life
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
what does a fetal anomaly incompatible
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
with life actually mean
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
if the anomaly
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
was currently incompatible with life the
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
child would be dead
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
if the child were dead then the child
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be removed from the mother in a
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
medical procedure that does not fall
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
under the rsa definition of abortion
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
but the child is not dead
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
the child is still alive
 
05:29:48.868 --> 05:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
so a fetal fatal fetal anomaly diagnosis
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
does not pertain to the child as it is
 
05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
but to the child as a medical

when in the future
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
after the first breath
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
a few days after

05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
in what time frame must the death occur
 
05:30:07.190 --> 05:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
for some condition to be incompatible
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
with life
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
every person in this room will
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
experience at some point a condition
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
however no medical provider even knowing
 
05:30:19.510 --> 05:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
the exact condition can predict exactly
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
when you or i will run out of time nor
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
can they exactly or infallibly predict
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
the life or death outcome for pre-born
 
05:30:26.000 --> 05:30:27.750 align:start position:0%

children
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of testimonies of
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
parents who after receiving a fatal
 
05:30:32.708 --> 05:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly diagnosis have still given
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
birth to children who lived some of whom
 
05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
who lived completely normal and healthy
 
05:30:37.040 --> 05:30:38.230 align:start position:0%
who lived completely normal and healthy
lives

05:30:38.230 --> 05:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
what if they had believed the faulty
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
predictions and chosen to kill their
 
05:30:41.280 --> 05:30:42.868 align:start position:0%
predictions and chosen to kill their
child

05:30:42.868 --> 05:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
my solution granted of waiting to induce
 
05:30:47.190 --> 05:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
labor at 30 weeks has elicit elicited
 
05:30:49.030 --> 05:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
concern about the psychological strain a
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
mother might endure by carrying the
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
child a few extra weeks after receiving
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
a fatal anomaly diagnosis
 
05:30:57.190 --> 05:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
however many women who choose abortion
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
rather than birth in such circumstances
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
carry the burden
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
of psychological strain not only for a
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
few weeks but for a lifetime
 
05:31:08.470 --> 05:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
always wondering if the diagnosis was
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
accurate or if they made a tragic
 
05:31:10.400 --> 05:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
accurate or if they made a tragic
mistake

05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is a fundamental difference
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
between losing a child to natural
 
05:31:17.350 --> 05:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances and actually giving the
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
order to take their life
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
abortions committed based on fallible
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
medical judgments or self-fulfilling
 
05:31:22.958 --> 05:31:24.310 align:start position:0%
medical judgments or self-fulfilling
prophecies

05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
prophecies
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
a doctor says a child will be dead
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so the doctors make that child dead
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
a baby is now dead by a doctor's
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis in action but there is no
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
postmortem autopsy to verify that that
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis was accurate it can only be a
 
05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
deadly unfalsifiable claim
 
05:31:44.948 --> 05:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
as a result misdiagnosed fully viable
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
children are killed
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
no one is held to account and the
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
mothers question and grieve
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
does the diagnosis of a likely but still
 
05:31:54.868 --> 05:31:54.878 align:start position:0%
only potential outcome give anyone the
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
right to preemptively kill a child
 
05:31:57.920 --> 05:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
right to preemptively kill a child
never

05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
how we view life matters
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
a child may only live for as long as
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's in its mother's womb but while it
 
05:32:06.868 --> 05:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
is there it is still alive
 
05:32:08.788 --> 05:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
is the value of life simply a matter of
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
function of utility of perfection
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
are not all people miracles even if
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
their first breath is their last
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
the baby may not be perfect fully
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
functional or have any utility in the
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
future but while it lives it is is it
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
not nonetheless a miracle is it
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless a person
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
every breath is a precious breath
 
05:32:29.830 --> 05:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether we take one or millions we all
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
want as many living breaths as we can
 
05:32:31.920 --> 05:32:33.110 align:start position:0%
want as many living breaths as we can
get

05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
as we sit here today breathing freely
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
alive till our last breath can we justly
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
deny an innocent child that same
 
05:32:39.440 --> 05:32:40.788 align:start position:0%
deny an innocent child that same
opportunity

05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
either all human life has intrinsic
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
value because it is made in the image of
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
god or none of it does no matter its
 
05:32:46.638 --> 05:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
god or none of it does no matter its
flaws

05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
flaws
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
no matter its brevity
 
05:32:52.708 --> 05:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
what will we do with children who are
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
less than perfect in form or function
 
05:32:58.470 --> 05:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
who certainly face difficult challenges
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the future or who may not even make
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
i say let them live mr speaker
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
for as long as they are able
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
let them live
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%

months and months to think about where
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're at right now
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%

really sort of overlooked i guess i
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
would say the question of
 
05:36:56.788 --> 05:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
the right of the woman to make the

thank you mr speaker
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues this bill
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
passed out the original policy committee
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
on a vote of 18-1 and was put on the
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
that shows bipartisan support for a
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
sound idea in regards to the educational
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
but for some reason the finance
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee added a non-german amendment
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with the fas but
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
rather ties us
 
05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
to some federal program
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
for tracking families for free reduced
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
student lunches and breakfast
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
it would require our state department of
 
05:41:43.760 --> 05:41:45.350 align:start position:0%
it would require our state department of
education

05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:41:45.360 --> 05:41:46.868 align:start position:0%
education
to

05:41:46.868 --> 05:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
work with the
 
05:41:50.830 --> 05:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid department and the
 
05:41:52.708 --> 05:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
usda and
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
tracking the children of new hampshire
 
05:41:55.920 --> 05:41:56.948 align:start position:0%
tracking the children of new hampshire
and

05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:59.510 --> 05:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to qualifying for financing
 
05:42:01.830 --> 05:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch
 
05:42:03.270 --> 05:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
but why would we get in bed with the
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
departments in washington d.c
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
all them are used as political weapons
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
against those out of favor
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
they are borderline corrupt at worst
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
and totally ineffective at best
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
do you love the epa
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
how about osha
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid is no different
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a vast morass of ineptitude and
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy so why would we want to get
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
closer to them
 
05:42:28.070 --> 05:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the usda
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
that is the government entity that told
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
you what to eat based on the food
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
pyramid you remember that
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
for a decade they told americans to eat
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
a diet based on grains bread cereal and
 
05:42:42.548 --> 05:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
pasta that department should be
 
05:42:42.558 --> 05:42:44.548 align:start position:0%
pasta that department should be
dismantled

05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
dismantled
 
05:42:46.470 --> 05:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire partisans of all
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
stripes cry for more local control
 
05:42:52.150 --> 05:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
whether in regards to masks in schools
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
or zoning
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
local local local
 
05:42:58.548 --> 05:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
even at the state level we are proud to
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
thumb our collective noses at the feds
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
such as with today's bill to sell
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis in state-owned stores
 
05:43:07.670 --> 05:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
even though marijuana is still
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
a schedule one felony level
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
drug at the federal level
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
but now this amendment goes the opposite
 
05:43:17.430 --> 05:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
direction demanding that our state
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
department of education work with usda
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
on a demonstration program
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
besides the fact that it's an unproven
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
demonstration program
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
we should all be very concerned about
 
05:43:32.470 --> 05:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
the very real potential for privacy
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
violations if enacted
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents your
 
05:43:37.360 --> 05:43:39.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents your
constituents

05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly and enthusiastically
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
passed a constitutional amendment to
 
05:43:46.470 --> 05:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
protect their personal privacy
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
to provide thousands of families
 
05:43:51.430 --> 05:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
personal financial information to
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
another group of faceless nameless
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats in washington is a terrible
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
concentration of power is a dangerous
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
slippery slope we don't want washington
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
d.c managing our affairs and tracking
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
our children
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
let's reject the urge to expand the
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
nanny state and do the right thing for
 
05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire by rejecting
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%

05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
i am opposed to the amendment 2022
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
1163-h and the new section application
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
for medicaid and certification program
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
my first opposition is to the cost that
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
will occur for the taxpayers which is

decide they do not want to be a part of

the program but will be enrolled

05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise to oppose the majority
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
committee amendment on house bill 1627.
 
05:46:22.470 --> 05:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
i have no objection to the good work of
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
the finance committee in making slight
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the appropriation in the
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the effective date thereof
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
in fact you may notice another amendment
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
in your c pocket that restates this
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
aspect of the majority committee
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that could be adopted should
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment fail
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
however i do object to section three of
 
05:46:42.868 --> 05:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment which was added following
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
a rushed non-germain amendment hearing
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
this new program could cost the state up
 
05:46:50.390 --> 05:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
to 60 million dollars annually
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not just the price tag i object
 
05:46:52.080 --> 05:46:53.110 align:start position:0%
but it's not just the price tag i object
to

05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
this new program undermines parental
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
rights violates the privacy of students
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and their family and imposes new new
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:05.590 --> 05:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
what this program does is sets up a new
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
automated data sharing between medicaid
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
and school districts
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
they'll start sharing data about
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
households including their income with
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
local school districts who then need to
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
compare that data against their student
 
05:47:15.200 --> 05:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
compare that data against their student
list

05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
this processing isn't magical
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
it isn't free
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to take some work and
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
therefore resources and money to do that
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
a new burden on school districts
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
this program is based on a flawed
 
05:47:30.000 --> 05:47:31.190 align:start position:0%
this program is based on a flawed
assumption

05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
the assumption that anyone who has not
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
applied for a government handout
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
failed to do so by mistake
 
05:47:40.708 --> 05:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
this program assumes that everyone wants
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
free government handouts food in this
 
05:47:42.718 --> 05:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
free government handouts food in this
case

05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the family is well aware of the
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
program but has chosen not to
 
05:47:47.200 --> 05:47:48.948 align:start position:0%
program but has chosen not to
participate

05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:47:50.868 --> 05:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
this program makes no provision for an
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
opt out or other way to say leave me
 
05:47:53.520 --> 05:47:55.270 align:start position:0%
opt out or other way to say leave me
alone

05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
alone
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
a family may do this because they don't
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
want their child eating the cafeteria
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
food and prefer to send a packed lunch
 
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
from home
 
05:48:03.430 --> 05:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they have strong opinions about
 
05:48:06.628 --> 05:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
organic or no non-gmo food
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
maybe their child has a condition like
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
celiac disease or fetal
 
05:48:12.230 --> 05:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah pku
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
maybe their child has a weight problem
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
and they're preparing a specific diet
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
maybe they're trying to follow a
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
religious dietary restriction
 
05:48:23.830 --> 05:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
it isn't for us to second guess the why
 
05:48:25.270 --> 05:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
parents should be
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
in charge unless they ask for help
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
and the application for free and reduced
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
meals is the way they do that
 
05:48:35.030 --> 05:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm incredulous that this program is
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
needed because free and reduced meals
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
application would be too hard for
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
parents to fill out when this program is
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
predicated on the assumption they've
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
already filled out the application for
 
05:48:43.600 --> 05:48:45.110 align:start position:0%
already filled out the application for
medicaid

05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.788 --> 05:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
but this isn't just a bad idea in
 
05:48:52.868 --> 05:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
general it's an especially bad idea
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
why right now because during the
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic the federal government
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
suspended medicaid eligibility testing
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
and just funded the over-enrollment that
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
occurred by not revalidating enrollee
 
05:49:04.878 --> 05:49:06.628 align:start position:0%
occurred by not revalidating enrollee
eligibility

05:49:06.628 --> 05:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
all the data in the medicaid system is
 
05:49:08.718 --> 05:49:09.830 align:start position:0%
all the data in the medicaid system is
as

05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:49:11.750 --> 05:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the household's last application or
 
05:49:11.760 --> 05:49:13.350 align:start position:0%
of the household's last application or
revalidation

05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
revalidation
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
which may have been two years ago
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
this problem has been in the news and
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
recognized as a huge undertaking for
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
states to reactivate their validation
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
programs and work through the backlog
 
05:49:26.470 --> 05:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
so here we are about to launch a new
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
program to to violate families privacy
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
trigger huge new stay outlet
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
state outlays and the data we're going
 
05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
to base the whole system on is well
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
known to be absolute junk right now
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
we could not have picked a worse time to
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
launch this program
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
even if you believe there is a good time
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
to launch this program which i don't it
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't now
 
05:49:50.548 --> 05:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
i ask you to press the red button to
 
05:49:52.150 --> 05:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
vote no on this amendment so that
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made that will
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
preserve the good work of the finance
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee on the original topic of the
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill and we can send that and only that
 
05:50:00.470 --> 05:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
onto the body on the other side of the
 
05:50:00.480 --> 05:50:01.350 align:start position:0%
onto the body on the other side of the
wall

05:50:01.350 --> 05:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
wall
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
does the member yield for a question
 
05:50:05.120 --> 05:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
does the member yield for a question
yes

05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:50:08.470 --> 05:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative leon you may inquire
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
i've looked into this program a little
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
bit because it seemed like it might be
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
able to streamline things but when i
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
found out that places like california
 
05:50:21.270 --> 05:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
where a county has the same number of
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
students as us
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
but they only have 20 school districts
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we have 200 school districts do you
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
think that this plan that works first
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
for states that have very large school
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
districts would actually be a
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
time saving and cost saving process in
 
05:50:37.350 --> 05:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or do you think it might
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
be more of a burden on our school
 
05:50:38.798 --> 05:50:42.948 align:start position:0%
be more of a burden on our school
districts

05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think your
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
question hits on one of the key aspects
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
of this that to automate anything is a
 
05:50:51.110 --> 05:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
big outlay in it costs and assumes you
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
have automated systems and people to run
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
those automated systems and for a very

participation in the pilot will better
 
05:52:50.470 --> 05:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
will result in better information
 
05:52:52.390 --> 05:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
about the number of children eligible
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%

children
 
05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
it'll give us more accurate count to
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
count the children and i ask for your
 
05:53:12.868 --> 05:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
support on this amendment
 
05:53:16.788 --> 05:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
i also want to mention that the in the
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
literature that we see from the
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
department of education they gave us a
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
general cost of 60 million dollars and
 
05:53:26.470 --> 05:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
that 60 million dollars was not
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
subtracted from the amount of money that
 
05:53:31.270 --> 05:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
had already that already goes into the
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula so that was somewhat
 
05:53:36.470 --> 05:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
misleading again i ask for your support
 
05:53:38.310 --> 05:53:38.320 align:start position:0%

bill
 
06:05:29.830 --> 06:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
civil asset forfeiture which really is
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
a poorly described
 
06:05:40.230 --> 06:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
term it's not civil at all
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:05:43.190 --> 06:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
a process of taking
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
property from citizens
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:05:59.110 --> 06:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
we should
 
06:05:59.120 --> 06:06:00.390 align:start position:0%
we should
ensure

06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
06:06:02.470 --> 06:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
that the other side of the wall gets the
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
message very loud and clear
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
with it being connected to this

with it being connected to this
bill

06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
that we
 
06:06:15.430 --> 06:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
are standing for the due process rights
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
has a program called
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
equitable sharing
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
equitable sharing

assets

06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
assets
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
are taken through a process
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
in the federal court system
 
06:06:44.878 --> 06:06:46.548 align:start position:0%
in the federal court system
and

06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:48.628 --> 06:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent of the
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
money that is forfeited in the civil
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
process without
 
06:06:52.878 --> 06:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
process without
the

06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:00.868 --> 06:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.030 --> 06:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of that money is returned
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
to local departments
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
now there's two parts
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
there are joint task force operations
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
which this language does not touch
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
our state law
 
06:07:25.430 --> 06:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
since 2016
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
instituted a policy where
 
06:07:31.750 --> 06:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
a criminal conviction was necessary
 
06:07:31.760 --> 06:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
a criminal conviction was necessary
before

06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
assets were
 
06:07:35.120 --> 06:07:36.628 align:start position:0%
assets were
forfeited

06:07:36.628 --> 06:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
forfeited
 
06:07:38.708 --> 06:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
and the proceeds
 
06:07:41.110 --> 06:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
45 percent
 
06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
returned to a local department 45
 
06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
percent given to the department of
 
06:07:44.958 --> 06:07:46.548 align:start position:0%
percent given to the department of
justice

06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
justice
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
and the remaining 10 percent
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
06:07:56.230 --> 06:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is a great incentive
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement
 
06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the federal route
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
i can think of people describing and
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
i've never been to third world nations
 
06:08:19.590 --> 06:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
where law enforcement
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
is put in a position where
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
they don't get paid through their
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
employment so much
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
but they make up a little
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
out on the road
 
06:08:31.760 --> 06:08:33.910 align:start position:0%
out on the road
we

06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:37.600 --> 06:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
allow

06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:08:43.600 --> 06:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
to be
incentivized

06:08:45.990 --> 06:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
incentivized
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
by this
 
06:08:47.520 --> 06:08:49.350 align:start position:0%
by this
process

06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:08:49.360 --> 06:08:51.510 align:start position:0%
process
of

06:08:51.510 --> 06:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
gaining funds
 
06:08:56.788 --> 06:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
which by the way
 
06:08:58.628 --> 06:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
come back and they do not go through the
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
budgetary process
 
06:09:02.470 --> 06:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
these funds go directly to the
 
06:09:02.480 --> 06:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
these funds go directly to the
department

06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's your county sheriff's your
 
06:09:07.590 --> 06:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
local police department
 
06:09:11.350 --> 06:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
this money is off budget
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:09:19.990 --> 06:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment which will support
 
06:09:22.868 --> 06:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
good law enforcement it will support
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
due process rights and protections for
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
our citizens this is
 
06:09:31.910 --> 06:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
language that has passed this body
 
06:09:33.670 --> 06:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
several times
 
06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
very strongly
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a message that needs to be
 
06:09:41.590 --> 06:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
delivered across the wall loud and clear
 
06:09:42.628 --> 06:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
so please
 
06:09:44.310 --> 06:09:44.320 align:start position:0%

06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
and let's get on with our day thank you

06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt floor
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendments one two four six
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative umberger requests a

i also come to order
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this amendment
 
06:11:47.350 --> 06:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
does not take anything away
 
06:11:49.190 --> 06:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
from the underlying bill
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
if i know that this amendment
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
adds due process rights
 
06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%

06:12:04.470 --> 06:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
that we are going to serve the people of
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state better by passing this please
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.830 --> 06:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative weiler is recognized for
 
06:12:22.230 --> 06:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
if i know this amendment is the same as
 
06:12:28.628 --> 06:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed out of here on march
 
06:12:28.638 --> 06:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed out of here on march
16th

06:12:30.310 --> 06:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
16th
 
06:12:32.708 --> 06:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that we have told
 
06:12:33.910 --> 06:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't excuse the
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
the other body
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't like omnibus bills with
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
different subject matters
 
06:12:45.750 --> 06:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that what i now say this is unnecessary
 
06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
since it's already the subject matter
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment is already in the other
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
body's hands when i now press the red
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
button so as to pass 1627 without
 
06:12:57.270 --> 06:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
muddying it
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt floor

amendment 1 2 4 6 h this is a division
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%

moves floor amendment 1248 which is
 
06:14:44.628 --> 06:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
found in your seat pockets and is
 
06:15:08.150 --> 06:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:15:12.628 --> 06:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks ago this body passed hb
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
1022 making ivermectin available via a
 
06:15:18.070 --> 06:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
standing order and i think that that
 
06:15:20.788 --> 06:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill is so important and historic that
 
06:15:25.030 --> 06:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
we should amend it on to hv1627
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
i'll briefly discuss the most recent
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
jama study that concluded that
 
06:15:32.070 --> 06:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
ivormectin did not work against covid19
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
besides the fact that this study treated
 
06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
only already critically ill patients and
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
ivermectin was not used as early
 
06:15:40.470 --> 06:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
treatment which is when proponents feel
 
06:15:43.110 --> 06:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
it is most beneficial the actual data
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
from the study showed a very different
 
06:15:47.590 --> 06:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
picture than the conclusion statement
 
06:15:49.350 --> 06:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the conclusion is rather
 
06:15:50.948 --> 06:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
laughable when you read the data from
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
the study
 
06:15:53.910 --> 06:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
the ivermectin study was split into two
 
06:15:55.350 --> 06:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
groups the vaccinated and the
 
06:15:55.360 --> 06:15:56.868 align:start position:0%
groups the vaccinated and the
unvaccinated

06:15:56.868 --> 06:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
06:15:58.708 --> 06:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
in the control arm of the study there
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
was only a 24 reduction in death from
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination alone but in the ivermectin
 
06:16:06.628 --> 06:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
arm of the study there was a 72
 
06:16:08.230 --> 06:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in death from in the
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and a 67 reduction in death
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the vaccinated
 
06:16:16.708 --> 06:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
but we've discussed covid and ivermectin
 
06:16:19.910 --> 06:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
at nauseum so let's move on shall we
 
06:16:23.190 --> 06:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
i did a brief search on the nih.gov

antiparasitic compound of wide use is

clearly a strong candidate for
 
06:17:22.708 --> 06:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
repositioning based on the fact that one
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
it is very safe causing almost no side
 
06:17:28.788 --> 06:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
effects and two it has proven anti-tumor
 
06:17:31.750 --> 06:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
effects in pre-clinical studies i could
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
go on from there but i'll stop it's
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
clear however
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
that there is a plenty of evidence to
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
take ivermectin out of the anti-parasite
 
06:17:44.788 --> 06:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
only box and be by being a cheap generic
 
06:17:47.830 --> 06:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
drug there is little profit in doing so
 
06:17:50.150 --> 06:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
with the politicization of this drug and
 
06:17:52.390 --> 06:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the general topsy-turvy world in which
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
we currently live where a fully fda
 
06:17:57.590 --> 06:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
approved drug is practically impossible
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
to get in this state for any off-label
 
06:18:02.470 --> 06:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
use despite the fact that normally
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
off-label prescribing is common practice
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
it is important we make sure our

come real close to the end of the
 
06:24:24.868 --> 06:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
calendar but yet we have a never-ending
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
pile of amendments for this bill in
 
06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
06:24:32.310 --> 06:24:32.320 align:start position:0%

move along with the day
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order

06:24:53.350 --> 06:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
once again
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.868 --> 06:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's not me
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's taking up all this time
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
it would be if
 
06:25:10.708 --> 06:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
it would really be wonderful
 
06:25:12.788 --> 06:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
if those amendments that are still on
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
the calendar were
 
06:25:14.840 --> 06:25:16.548 align:start position:0%

withdrawn
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:25:20.230 --> 06:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
we could go forward
 
06:25:23.110 --> 06:25:23.120 align:start position:0%

06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
of all members president had an
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
06:26:39.190 --> 06:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of

prout offers amendment
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
1252h which can be found in your seat
 
06:27:01.430 --> 06:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
pockets and is recognized to speak to
 
06:27:04.070 --> 06:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
and before everybody takes off i don't
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this amendment would attach
 
06:27:20.230 --> 06:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency reform bill that
 
06:27:23.590 --> 06:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
we passed in january to this bill
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
this state of emergency reform was a
 
06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
critical piece of the agreements that
 
06:27:28.708 --> 06:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
got us to a place where the budget would
 
06:27:30.390 --> 06:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
pass last year
 
06:27:32.468 --> 06:27:32.478 align:start position:0%
it differs from what was in hb2 last
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
year and is
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
now current law in that the default
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
thing that happens if nobody does
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
anything is
 
06:27:38.798 --> 06:27:40.708 align:start position:0%
anything is
nothing

06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
06:27:43.830 --> 06:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency ends
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
under the current law the governor is
 
06:27:47.110 --> 06:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
required to call this legislature into
 
06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
special session to determine if the
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency should end
 
06:27:53.510 --> 06:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
however he does not have that authority
 
06:27:55.510 --> 06:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
alone he must receive the approval of
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
the executive council to call us in a
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
special session
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
so what happens if the council
 
06:27:59.600 --> 06:28:01.190 align:start position:0%
so what happens if the council
disapproves

06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
disapproves
 
06:28:03.510 --> 06:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
the bill does not specify
 
06:28:05.670 --> 06:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
and the state of emergency continues and
 
06:28:05.680 --> 06:28:07.030 align:start position:0%
and the state of emergency continues and
continues

06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
continues
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:12.150 --> 06:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
gridlock it's often used as a negative
 
06:28:13.750 --> 06:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
term but it's a critical feature of our
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
system of government multiple branches
 
06:28:18.948 --> 06:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
of bodies of governments must agree
 
06:28:21.350 --> 06:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
to change the status quo
 
06:28:22.868 --> 06:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution uses the
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
phrase have a negative on one another
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
but it's the same thing
 
06:28:30.468 --> 06:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
and voters seem to know understand and
 
06:28:32.948 --> 06:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes it looks like they preferred
 
06:28:35.430 --> 06:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
we often seen the voters of this country
 
06:28:36.788 --> 06:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
seemingly intentionally split the
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
branches and bodies of the federal
 
06:28:40.150 --> 06:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
government among the parties and caused
 
06:28:43.270 --> 06:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:44.830 --> 06:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
why would that
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
be i think back to the phrase no man's
 
06:28:50.230 --> 06:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
life liberty or property are safe while
 
06:28:53.110 --> 06:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature is in session
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
we'll add my own extension unless it's
 
06:28:55.360 --> 06:28:57.670 align:start position:0%
we'll add my own extension unless it's
gridlocked

06:28:57.670 --> 06:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
gridlocked
 
06:28:59.110 --> 06:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's an important difference in
 
06:29:00.628 --> 06:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
how these methods of dealing with a long
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
lasting state of emergency differ what
 
06:29:04.868 --> 06:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
happens when there's gridlock
 
06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
what happens when the branches of
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
government disagree
 
06:29:09.990 --> 06:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
i argue that the most people would
 
06:29:11.430 --> 06:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
assume that we can't agree the
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
government does nothing new or special
 
06:29:17.670 --> 06:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
like the state of emergency
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
just like when we can't pass a law due
 
06:29:21.190 --> 06:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
to gridlock
 
06:29:22.948 --> 06:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
this isn't a referendum on how emergency
 
06:29:24.868 --> 06:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
powers were used in the past this isn't
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
a retroactive law
 
06:29:27.990 --> 06:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
nor is it meant to reflect on anyone
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently or holding or running for
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
office we went through 18 years after
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency reform in 2002

06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
what the district lines will be
 
06:39:47.910 --> 06:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily uncertainty
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
unexpected uncertainty
 
06:39:53.510 --> 06:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
it is unnecessary and unexpected because
 
06:39:57.030 --> 06:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
we currently have a single party
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
political party
 
06:40:02.070 --> 06:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
in our control in this state
 
06:40:04.468 --> 06:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
everyone except us
 
06:40:07.110 --> 06:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
who work together as a family to get
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
this done
 
06:40:12.150 --> 06:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
everyone except those who use the house
 
06:40:14.390 --> 06:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
proposed past
 
06:40:16.230 --> 06:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
they could stop making
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
campaign plans and base it on
 
06:40:22.468 --> 06:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
that everyone has
 
06:40:25.190 --> 06:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
participated in the discussion and hash
 
06:40:27.990 --> 06:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
things out behind the scenes
 
06:40:32.708 --> 06:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:35.030 --> 06:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
like we've always seen
 
06:40:37.510 --> 06:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
with so far too many other bills
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
06:40:41.590 --> 06:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
distinct lack of encouragement at the
 
06:40:42.948 --> 06:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
and any other communications until the
 
06:40:46.030 --> 06:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
06:40:46.040 --> 06:40:47.670 align:start position:0%
last minute
[Music]

06:40:47.670 --> 06:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
if at all from the executive branch
 
06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
and this house is just left to look
 
06:40:55.350 --> 06:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
foolish passing things that won't be
 
06:40:57.590 --> 06:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
06:40:59.590 --> 06:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
creating more work
 
06:41:03.350 --> 06:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
we should start sending a clear message
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we're tired of that
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
these are the districts we passed
 
06:41:15.670 --> 06:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
although thorough and thoughtful
 
06:41:15.680 --> 06:41:16.868 align:start position:0%
although thorough and thoughtful
considered

06:41:16.868 --> 06:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see them attached to
 
06:41:21.030 --> 06:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
quite a few things
 
06:41:23.510 --> 06:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe important things
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.948 --> 06:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
and send a message that enough is enough
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
this is the way
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
of doing business
 
06:41:36.390 --> 06:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker does the member
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%

speaker uh thank you representative
 
06:41:47.430 --> 06:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question you know we've been
 
06:41:49.190 --> 06:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
sitting here to all these amendments
 
06:41:51.510 --> 06:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
which you know i'm kind of shocked at
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
did all these amendments come forward
 
06:41:58.150 --> 06:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
because we wasted all this time on
 
06:41:59.910 --> 06:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that we already passed that
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
does not even take effect of 2025 is
 
06:42:04.150 --> 06:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
that what this is all about trying to
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
stop that amendment on something that
 
06:42:11.590 --> 06:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:11.600 --> 06:42:12.788 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:42:12.788 --> 06:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:42:12.798 --> 06:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
no
no

06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:23.590 --> 06:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
the member from hudson representative
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
proutz recognized to speak and support
 
06:42:33.430 --> 06:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:36.948 --> 06:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:39.030 --> 06:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with the previous speaker and
 
06:42:41.830 --> 06:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
i've seen it in my own town as it's been
 
06:42:43.350 --> 06:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the various plans have been published
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
flip-flopping between the districts
 
06:42:47.910 --> 06:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
going from evaluating candidates in one
 
06:42:49.830 --> 06:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
district doing endorsements planning
 
06:42:51.590 --> 06:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
house parties to now all of a sudden i
 
06:42:52.948 --> 06:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
have to switch gears and look at the
 
06:42:55.190 --> 06:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
other one
 
06:42:57.350 --> 06:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
the back and forth
 
06:42:59.670 --> 06:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
has been terrible for the politics in my
 
06:42:59.680 --> 06:43:00.708 align:start position:0%
has been terrible for the politics in my
town

06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
town
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
and terrible for planning for how to
 
06:43:04.390 --> 06:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
support the great candidates that we
 
06:43:05.430 --> 06:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
have running
 
06:43:07.030 --> 06:43:07.040 align:start position:0%

and i ask you to vote green on this
amendment

06:43:08.150 --> 06:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:43:10.070 --> 06:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
to send the message that that was not
 
06:43:11.590 --> 06:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
what we wanted
 
06:43:13.270 --> 06:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you does the member yield for a
 
06:43:13.280 --> 06:43:15.430 align:start position:0%
thank you does the member yield for a
question

06:43:15.430 --> 06:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:43:15.440 --> 06:43:16.468 align:start position:0%
question
yes

06:43:16.468 --> 06:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:43:21.270 --> 06:43:21.280 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for taking the
question

06:43:23.830 --> 06:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:43:27.030 --> 06:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
i've heard some talk about omnibus bills
 
06:43:29.110 --> 06:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
and uh with the adoption of the previous
 
06:43:31.190 --> 06:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that was non-germane is this
 
06:43:33.190 --> 06:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill already an omnibus bill and so
 
06:43:34.310 --> 06:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
therefore if you're planning on
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
supporting it you can support all of
 
06:43:42.788 --> 06:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:44.948 --> 06:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i would say
 
06:43:47.190 --> 06:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as it says before us uh as
 
06:43:49.190 --> 06:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
amended by the first amendment does
 
06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
contain more than one subject which is
 
06:43:52.708 --> 06:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
most people's definition of an omnisore
 
06:43:52.718 --> 06:44:04.948 align:start position:0%
most people's definition of an omnisore
spill

06:44:04.948 --> 06:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:06.708 --> 06:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
the member from goffstown representative
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
griffin is recognized to speak against
 
06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:20.390 --> 06:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
i am all for sending a clear message
 
06:44:22.830 --> 06:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
i'm all for
 
06:44:25.590 --> 06:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
that haven't had an opportunity to work
 
06:44:27.990 --> 06:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
with all of you but those of you who
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
have worked with me
 
06:44:32.390 --> 06:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
knows yes means yes
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
and no means no
 
06:44:36.830 --> 06:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
and you don't need to ask
 
06:44:40.070 --> 06:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
again pressing the red button means no
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
pressing the green button means yes
 
06:44:46.390 --> 06:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to send the bill to
 
06:44:48.628 --> 06:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
you again
 
06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
i have every confidence
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
that every member of this body who has
 
06:44:54.708 --> 06:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
worked with me is capable of
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
understanding me when i say i'm for
 
06:44:56.718 --> 06:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
understanding me when i say i'm for
something

06:44:57.910 --> 06:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:44:59.910 --> 06:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i have every confidence that the
 
06:45:02.310 --> 06:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
other body is capable of understanding
 
06:45:05.350 --> 06:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
that message when it comes over
 
06:45:07.990 --> 06:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that is part of what we do
 
06:45:11.110 --> 06:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
we are not here alone not alone in a
 
06:45:14.948 --> 06:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
seat of of one in a room of 400 and not
 
06:45:20.468 --> 06:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:23.430 --> 06:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to what we're talking about
 
06:45:25.030 --> 06:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
i heard issues in regards to
 
06:45:28.628 --> 06:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
redistricting well welcome to politics
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
every 10 years we redistrict and it's
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
not just new hampshire it's every state
 
06:45:34.948 --> 06:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the union
 
06:45:36.788 --> 06:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
and those districts change and they're
 
06:45:39.030 --> 06:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
not your district
 
06:45:42.390 --> 06:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
we don't start from incumbency
 
06:45:46.070 --> 06:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
we start with census data and go forward
 
06:45:48.310 --> 06:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we may not all agree on how to get
 
06:45:50.548 --> 06:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
there and we may not agree on the
 
06:45:52.548 --> 06:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
timetable and we may have a late
 
06:45:56.548 --> 06:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
timetable but it's not news
 
06:45:58.628 --> 06:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
because the secretary of state's office
 
06:46:01.750 --> 06:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
has a process for changing the filing
 
06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
period because it often happens that
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting affects the time period to
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
file for a district because we don't
 
06:46:16.468 --> 06:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:18.390 --> 06:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
in regards to what you're being asked to
 
06:46:21.270 --> 06:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
vote on today i have been placed in a
 
06:46:23.670 --> 06:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult position
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
because i really like this bill
 
06:46:28.070 --> 06:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
i really like the bill that this
 
06:46:32.948 --> 06:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
amendment represents which is hb 52
 
06:46:34.628 --> 06:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
which came out of the special committee
 
06:46:36.868 --> 06:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
on redistricting and i voted for yes is
 
06:46:36.878 --> 06:46:39.030 align:start position:0%
on redistricting and i voted for yes is
yes

06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the senate has voted excuse me the body
 
06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall is voted
 
06:46:45.350 --> 06:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes and is yes but we're here sending a
 
06:46:47.190 --> 06:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
message because there are other messages
 
06:46:48.868 --> 06:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
floating around in the political world
 
06:46:50.310 --> 06:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i've already moved on to the next
 
06:46:52.390 --> 06:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
step i don't know about you but i think
 
06:46:54.070 --> 06:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
i might know what's coming and i think i
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
might have to come back to this body
 
06:46:59.110 --> 06:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
with another cd map because the process
 
06:47:01.910 --> 06:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
has not ended yet
 
06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the sad thing is is that this
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
process today for addressing bills could
 
06:47:09.110 --> 06:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
have been much further down the path
 
06:47:11.510 --> 06:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
without multiple amendments creating
 
06:47:13.590 --> 06:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
indeed an omnibus bill
 
06:47:16.310 --> 06:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
when we are not capable of tabling any
 
06:47:18.468 --> 06:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
of these amendments without
 
06:47:20.390 --> 06:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
in fact tabling the underlying
 
06:47:22.548 --> 06:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
legislation which many of us apparently
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
thought was good because it already
 
06:47:27.510 --> 06:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.468 --> 06:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
so as i've sat here today looking around
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
going through this and by the way how
 
06:47:34.548 --> 06:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
many of you agree with me that the
 
06:47:37.590 --> 06:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
sconces on this wall are 55 as compared
 
06:47:40.628 --> 06:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
to the sidewall or 52.
 
06:47:42.070 --> 06:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know i can never get the same
 
06:47:44.150 --> 06:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
number the second time my eyes just
 
06:47:48.628 --> 06:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:49.990 --> 06:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's about as relevant to the
 
06:47:54.150 --> 06:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:56.708 --> 06:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
so i stand here and i apologize for
 
06:47:58.468 --> 06:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
taking up your time
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
and i i apologize
 
06:48:03.190 --> 06:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
i wish i could apologize for others in
 
06:48:05.510 --> 06:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
regards to taking up your time
 
06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i want to just thank you for having
 
06:48:09.830 --> 06:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of listening to me
 
06:48:11.350 --> 06:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i ask
 
06:48:13.270 --> 06:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
that you vote red

06:56:59.110 --> 06:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
report that will be available later this
 
06:57:01.910 --> 06:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
year to help us understand the financial
 
06:57:04.468 --> 06:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
impact of this piece of legislation
 
06:57:07.510 --> 06:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
and if i know that is the responsibility
 
06:57:10.468 --> 06:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
of the finance committee to evaluate the
 
06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
financial impact of legislation and in
 
06:57:16.070 --> 06:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
this case the committee was unable to do
 
06:57:17.110 --> 06:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
our job
 
06:57:21.670 --> 06:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
would i now vote yes to table this bill
 
06:57:23.270 --> 06:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is recognized for
 
06:57:25.430 --> 06:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry uh thank you mr
 
06:57:25.440 --> 06:57:26.708 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry uh thank you mr
speaker

06:57:26.708 --> 06:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
06:57:27.960 --> 06:57:27.970 align:start position:0%
if i knew that
 
06:57:27.970 --> 06:57:29.350 align:start position:0%
if i knew that
[Music]

06:57:29.350 --> 06:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:57:31.830 --> 06:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
upon listening to the minority of the
 
06:57:35.430 --> 06:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee that we adopted an amendment
 
06:57:39.510 --> 06:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do as they asked which was to cut out
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
the portion of the bill dealing
 
06:57:44.390 --> 06:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
with that would have had the financial
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
impact to take that issue off the table
 
06:57:49.830 --> 06:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
06:57:52.788 --> 06:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
that the remaining part of it is an
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
essential element that the courts have
 
06:57:57.910 --> 06:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
been begging for since 2018
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is a formula that would help
 
06:58:03.670 --> 06:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
establish fairness
 
06:58:05.430 --> 06:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a shared parenting
 
06:58:05.440 --> 06:58:06.708 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a shared parenting
agreement

06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
06:58:08.468 --> 06:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
and if i knew
 
06:58:11.510 --> 06:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
that family court is hell
 
06:58:13.910 --> 06:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we could make it a little less bad
 
06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
if we put this formula in place would i
 
06:58:17.120 --> 06:58:18.468 align:start position:0%
if we put this formula in place would i
now

06:58:18.468 --> 06:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:58:20.628 --> 06:58:20.638 align:start position:0%

06:58:22.868 --> 06:58:22.878 align:start position:0%

06:58:28.390 --> 06:58:28.400 align:start position:0%

07:00:22.468 --> 07:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:00:23.628 --> 07:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
07:00:26.548 --> 07:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
1647 is exactly the kind of bill that
 
07:00:28.788 --> 07:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
should come to the finance committee as
 
07:00:30.468 --> 07:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
a second committee
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and the house
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
passed new policy that has potential for
 
07:00:39.110 --> 07:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
financial impact on the state budget
 
07:00:41.590 --> 07:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
during division three work sessions on
 
07:00:44.070 --> 07:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill there was testimony on the
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
policy for members of the public
 
07:00:48.548 --> 07:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
but the department of health and human
 
07:00:51.590 --> 07:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
services could not give us information
 
07:00:53.430 --> 07:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
on the financial impact of this
 
07:00:53.440 --> 07:00:55.110 align:start position:0%
on the financial impact of this
legislation

07:00:55.110 --> 07:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
the department
 
07:00:58.708 --> 07:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
representatives informed us
 
07:01:01.670 --> 07:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
that they are now working on a report
 
07:01:04.230 --> 07:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
which will provide us with information
 
07:01:06.628 --> 07:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
that will be helpful in determining the
 
07:01:09.990 --> 07:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
financial impact of this policy change
 
07:01:12.310 --> 07:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
this bill should not move forward until
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
we understand the impact it will have on
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
our tanf
 
07:01:19.990 --> 07:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
food stamp medicaid and housing
 
07:01:22.310 --> 07:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
assistance expenditures
 
07:01:24.390 --> 07:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
the job of the finance committee is to
 
07:01:28.390 --> 07:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
figure out the cost of new policy
 
07:01:31.190 --> 07:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
more time and information are needed
 
07:01:33.510 --> 07:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
before we have adequate information to
 
07:01:35.270 --> 07:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation
 
07:01:38.708 --> 07:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
i urge members to vote no on this motion
 
07:01:40.948 --> 07:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
and to allow for a
 
07:01:42.310 --> 07:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
motion of
 
07:01:45.190 --> 07:01:45.200 align:start position:0%

07:01:49.270 --> 07:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
interim study to come forward thank you
 
07:01:50.708 --> 07:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
the member from where representative
 
07:01:52.948 --> 07:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
earth is recognized to speak in support
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:01.510 --> 07:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:02:03.670 --> 07:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
a number of study committees over the
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
07:02:08.468 --> 07:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
have looked at our child support laws in
 
07:02:11.830 --> 07:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
2015 the legislature authorized half
 
07:02:14.390 --> 07:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars to this to the carsey
 
07:02:17.110 --> 07:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
school for the most extensive study to
 
07:02:18.948 --> 07:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
review new hampshire's child support
 
07:02:18.958 --> 07:02:20.310 align:start position:0%
review new hampshire's child support
guidelines

07:02:20.310 --> 07:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
07:02:23.750 --> 07:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
their report was complete in 2018
 
07:02:26.230 --> 07:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
and stated quote
 
07:02:29.750 --> 07:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
as substantially equal parenting
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
increases in a number of cases
 
07:02:34.390 --> 07:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
a larger proportion
 
07:02:36.468 --> 07:02:36.478 align:start position:0%
of child support cases
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
must deviate from the guidelines to
 
07:02:42.310 --> 07:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
account for the sharing of expenses
 
07:02:44.948 --> 07:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
this results in a range of possible
 
07:02:44.958 --> 07:02:46.230 align:start position:0%
this results in a range of possible
outcomes

07:02:46.230 --> 07:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
07:02:48.948 --> 07:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
little predictability for parents
 
07:02:50.468 --> 07:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
entering the system
 
07:02:52.230 --> 07:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
and in some cases
 
07:02:54.868 --> 07:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
judgments that are inconsistent
 
07:02:57.270 --> 07:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
and not fair alternately
 
07:02:58.788 --> 07:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
to the obligate
 
07:03:01.350 --> 07:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
or obligor quote
 
07:03:02.468 --> 07:03:02.478 align:start position:0%
i don't know what those are either but
 
07:03:05.590 --> 07:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's basically one side of the other
 
07:03:08.948 --> 07:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the courts made it difficult
 
07:03:10.628 --> 07:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
to provide for shared child support
 
07:03:16.868 --> 07:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
when shared parenting is approved
 
07:03:19.510 --> 07:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the most extreme case
 
07:03:21.830 --> 07:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
this means that if one parent
 
07:03:24.310 --> 07:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
has one dollar more of income
 
07:03:25.750 --> 07:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
than the other
 
07:03:29.830 --> 07:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the parenting is being shared 50 50
 
07:03:32.468 --> 07:03:32.478 align:start position:0%
all of the child support goes to the
 
07:03:36.150 --> 07:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
parent with one dollar less income
 
07:03:39.270 --> 07:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
the parent with one dollar more income
 
07:03:41.430 --> 07:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
pays the other parent
 
07:03:44.150 --> 07:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
their half of the child support
 
07:03:45.830 --> 07:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
leaving them without the funds to
 
07:03:48.948 --> 07:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
support the child who was with them half
 
07:03:50.788 --> 07:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
the time
 
07:03:52.708 --> 07:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment we passed
 
07:03:55.830 --> 07:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
changes the income threshold
 
07:03:57.350 --> 07:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
below which
 
07:04:00.230 --> 07:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
a person qualifies to make a fixed
 
07:04:00.240 --> 07:04:01.750 align:start position:0%
a person qualifies to make a fixed
contribution

07:04:01.750 --> 07:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
07:04:04.150 --> 07:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
of fifty dollars per month
 
07:04:05.910 --> 07:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
to child support
 
07:04:08.468 --> 07:04:08.478 align:start position:0%
from one hundred and fifty percent of
 
07:04:10.628 --> 07:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level
 
07:04:13.350 --> 07:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
back to a hundred and fifteen percent as
 
07:04:15.430 --> 07:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
in current law
 
07:04:18.708 --> 07:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
this minimizes the fiscal impact to the
 
07:04:20.230 --> 07:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
07:04:23.430 --> 07:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
during the transition to the more fairly
 
07:04:27.350 --> 07:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
balanced child support allocations
 
07:04:29.430 --> 07:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
the next legislature
 
07:04:32.708 --> 07:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
will then have the quadrennial review
 
07:04:35.110 --> 07:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the child support system
 
07:04:36.708 --> 07:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
being done by the new hampshire

1950s for the new hampshire savings bank
 
07:07:48.628 --> 07:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
and later many years later the state

i understand a project usually goes

07:08:36.910 --> 07:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
07:08:39.590 --> 07:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
1.9 million and there was a capital

even recently
 
07:08:53.910 --> 07:08:53.920 align:start position:0%

07:08:58.868 --> 07:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
i think is something each of us needs to

i think is something each of us needs to
know

07:08:59.830 --> 07:08:59.840 align:start position:0%

07:09:03.030 --> 07:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
is it one month or one year
 
07:09:05.670 --> 07:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
two months or two years
 
07:09:09.110 --> 07:09:09.120 align:start position:0%

and all we have is totals i asked
 
07:09:26.070 --> 07:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
requested details of the 35 million of
 
07:09:28.150 --> 07:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be spent and as of
 
07:09:32.390 --> 07:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:34.868 --> 07:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
i need this kind of information to make
 
07:09:37.830 --> 07:09:37.840 align:start position:0%

07:09:45.670 --> 07:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i believe the time is not here and
 
07:09:48.230 --> 07:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
is not now
 
07:09:52.070 --> 07:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are in double-digit inflation
 
07:09:54.708 --> 07:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
many citizens in new hampshire
 
07:09:57.030 --> 07:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out how to pay
 
07:09:59.510 --> 07:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
their gas bills for the vehicle to get
 
07:10:01.990 --> 07:10:02.000 align:start position:0%

and electricity and heating bills
 
07:10:13.590 --> 07:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to hope
 
07:10:17.590 --> 07:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
inflation is going to lessen
 
07:10:20.948 --> 07:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
but currently do not believe it
 
07:10:23.830 --> 07:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
if we are going
 
07:10:25.110 --> 07:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
to have
 
07:10:28.548 --> 07:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars plus surplus
 
07:10:31.670 --> 07:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
then why don't we make plans
 
07:10:34.390 --> 07:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
to give much of it back to the citizens
 
07:10:35.830 --> 07:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
07:10:38.788 --> 07:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
and utilize the remainder of the surplus
 
07:10:40.788 --> 07:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
to possibly pay down some of new
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire's debts
 
07:10:44.868 --> 07:10:44.878 align:start position:0%

07:12:05.510 --> 07:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the parking garage and the
 
07:12:08.230 --> 07:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
need to replace replacement
 
07:12:10.150 --> 07:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
but the can has always been kicked down
 
07:12:11.350 --> 07:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
the road
 
07:12:12.708 --> 07:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
today we've reached the end of the road
 
07:12:14.948 --> 07:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
and action is required now
 
07:12:17.270 --> 07:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
those of us who park there have noticed
 
07:12:17.280 --> 07:12:18.468 align:start position:0%
those of us who park there have noticed
netting

07:12:18.468 --> 07:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
netting
 
07:12:20.868 --> 07:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
really heavy netting that hangs below
 
07:12:23.670 --> 07:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
the first and second floor decks
 
07:12:25.350 --> 07:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
the netting is there to keep chunks of
 
07:12:27.910 --> 07:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
the garage from falling onto the street
 
07:12:29.830 --> 07:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
or falling onto the floor the first
 
07:12:32.868 --> 07:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
floor deck or onto cars
 
07:12:34.628 --> 07:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
or onto people
 
07:12:36.150 --> 07:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
i've been watching that netting very
 
07:12:37.830 --> 07:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
carefully since this was brought to my
 
07:12:40.070 --> 07:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
attention and i try to drive a little
 
07:12:42.628 --> 07:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
faster to get to the second floor level
 
07:12:44.230 --> 07:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
although the really tight turns still
 
07:12:46.310 --> 07:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
slow me down
 
07:12:48.150 --> 07:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
further there's been an increasing
 
07:12:50.948 --> 07:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
number of reports of injuries
 
07:12:52.948 --> 07:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
to date at least these injuries have
 
07:12:54.708 --> 07:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
been relatively minor
 
07:12:56.628 --> 07:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
they involve scrapes and cuts from the
 
07:12:59.190 --> 07:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
railings trips and stumbles because of
 
07:13:02.310 --> 07:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
the uneven surfaces as i said the number
 
07:13:04.468 --> 07:13:04.478 align:start position:0%
of reports is increasing and we need to
 
07:13:07.030 --> 07:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
address this problem before it becomes
 
07:13:08.788 --> 07:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
more numerous
 
07:13:11.110 --> 07:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
as well as more serious
 
07:13:12.708 --> 07:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
some of you may have not realized as a
 
07:13:14.150 --> 07:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
speaker said before that we have been
 
07:13:16.468 --> 07:13:16.478 align:start position:0%
spending several million dollars
 
07:13:18.868 --> 07:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
for some years now in order to keep the
 
07:13:21.830 --> 07:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
garage usable and at some level safe
 
07:13:23.670 --> 07:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
i have to add
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
that there seems to be various levels of
 
07:13:28.868 --> 07:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
understanding as to what is safe
 
07:13:30.468 --> 07:13:30.478 align:start position:0%
sort of safe
 
07:13:32.628 --> 07:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
or just plain unsafe
 
07:13:34.628 --> 07:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
however you see it the millions are
 
07:13:36.788 --> 07:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
adding up quickly and are not doing
 
07:13:39.030 --> 07:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
anything to address the problem
 
07:13:40.788 --> 07:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
for these reasons this situation has
 
07:13:41.990 --> 07:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
reached the point where it must be
 
07:13:43.910 --> 07:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
considered an emergency and this
 
07:13:43.920 --> 07:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
considered an emergency and this
amendment

07:13:45.590 --> 07:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:13:47.750 --> 07:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment will lodge 35 million
 
07:13:49.990 --> 07:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to do four tasks one is to
 
07:13:51.990 --> 07:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
demolish the current garage
 
07:13:53.750 --> 07:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
two is to demolish the building now home
 
07:13:56.390 --> 07:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the department of justice
 
07:13:58.708 --> 07:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
three is to relocate the department of
 
07:14:00.708 --> 07:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
justice to a new location one already
 
07:14:02.788 --> 07:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
available and four to construct a new
 
07:14:04.628 --> 07:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
garage on the site of the current
 
07:14:04.638 --> 07:14:06.628 align:start position:0%
garage on the site of the current
location

07:14:06.628 --> 07:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
location
 
07:14:08.070 --> 07:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
let me add that many consider the
 
07:14:09.590 --> 07:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
current location of the department of
 
07:14:11.350 --> 07:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
justice to be somewhat unsuitable for
 
07:14:13.750 --> 07:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
the sensitive work that they do
 
07:14:15.750 --> 07:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
this new garage will also solve another
 
07:14:17.590 --> 07:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
problem with stores in that it does not
 
07:14:19.110 --> 07:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
have enough spaces for all the
 
07:14:21.270 --> 07:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislators who are assigned to park
 
07:14:21.280 --> 07:14:22.150 align:start position:0%
legislators who are assigned to park
there

07:14:22.150 --> 07:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:14:23.830 --> 07:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
you're on your own to find your own
 
07:14:26.948 --> 07:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
parking if you're a tad late for session
 
07:14:28.948 --> 07:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
the new structure will have enough space
 
07:14:30.628 --> 07:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
for all and it will provide far better
 
07:14:30.638 --> 07:14:31.670 align:start position:0%
for all and it will provide far better
access

07:14:31.670 --> 07:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
access
 
07:14:33.670 --> 07:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
for those with disabilities
 
07:14:36.150 --> 07:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
the new project will not be bonded but
 
07:14:38.548 --> 07:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
will use cash that is currently on hand
 
07:14:40.948 --> 07:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
by not bonding the project there will be
 
07:14:43.270 --> 07:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
no adverse effect on projects supported
 
07:14:46.468 --> 07:14:46.478 align:start position:0%
throughout the capital projects process
 
07:14:48.788 --> 07:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
it always stings when we have to spend
 
07:14:51.510 --> 07:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
money and 35 million dollars is a lot of
 
07:14:51.520 --> 07:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
money and 35 million dollars is a lot of
money

07:14:53.030 --> 07:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
07:14:54.628 --> 07:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
for some there are always going to be
 
07:14:56.310 --> 07:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
other projects that would seem to be
 
07:14:58.468 --> 07:14:58.478 align:start position:0%
more critical for others spending money
 
07:15:00.310 --> 07:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
on anything stings
 
07:15:01.910 --> 07:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
regardless this is a problem that
 
07:15:04.310 --> 07:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
requires our attention now
 
07:15:06.070 --> 07:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
at this time i don't have the details
 
07:15:07.750 --> 07:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
regarding the design i don't have a
 
07:15:09.910 --> 07:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
timeline i'm asking support of this
 
07:15:11.670 --> 07:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
amendment in order to finally get this
 
07:15:14.788 --> 07:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
long overdue process underway
 
07:15:17.910 --> 07:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
we do need to address this emergency
 
07:15:19.590 --> 07:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
before the situation becomes
 
07:15:21.910 --> 07:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
catastrophic which will be far more
 
07:15:24.468 --> 07:15:24.478 align:start position:0%
expensive not only financially but also
 
07:15:27.030 --> 07:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
on a human level i ask you please
 
07:15:29.030 --> 07:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
support this amendment thank you for
 
07:15:32.708 --> 07:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:34.468 --> 07:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
07:15:34.478 --> 07:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
is

07:15:35.750 --> 07:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is

07:15:47.270 --> 07:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:49.190 --> 07:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
07:16:35.350 --> 07:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:35.360 --> 07:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
just

07:17:10.230 --> 07:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:10.240 --> 07:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:17:35.190 --> 07:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:37.510 --> 07:17:37.520 align:start position:0%

that store street garage
 
07:18:00.468 --> 07:18:00.478 align:start position:0%
needs replacing

needs replacing
yesterday

07:18:01.830 --> 07:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
07:18:04.948 --> 07:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
or maybe five years ago
 
07:18:04.958 --> 07:18:06.310 align:start position:0%
or maybe five years ago
but

07:18:06.310 --> 07:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:18:09.110 --> 07:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
if i know that it has always been put
 
07:18:09.120 --> 07:18:10.150 align:start position:0%
if i know that it has always been put
off

07:18:10.150 --> 07:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
off
 
07:18:14.548 --> 07:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
because we have had higher priorities

07:32:05.430 --> 07:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
four amendment uh one two five three h
 
07:32:07.190 --> 07:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
is a friendly amendment that fixes an
 
07:32:09.110 --> 07:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence
 
07:32:10.708 --> 07:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
from the committee majority amendment
 
07:32:12.388 --> 07:32:12.398 align:start position:0%
that we just passed
 
07:32:14.070 --> 07:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
under that amendment edible cannabis
 
07:32:16.150 --> 07:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
products can no longer be sold in retail
 
07:32:16.160 --> 07:32:17.670 align:start position:0%
products can no longer be sold in retail
establishments

07:32:17.670 --> 07:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
07:32:19.430 --> 07:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
but the amendment also eliminated the
 
07:32:21.430 --> 07:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
existing cannabis decriminalization
 
07:32:21.440 --> 07:32:22.708 align:start position:0%
existing cannabis decriminalization
statute

07:32:22.708 --> 07:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:32:24.708 --> 07:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
the bill does that because if we're
 
07:32:26.150 --> 07:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
legalizing it we no longer need a
 
07:32:28.788 --> 07:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
decriminalization statute anymore
 
07:32:30.708 --> 07:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
but by removing retail sale of edible
 
07:32:32.310 --> 07:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis products from the bill and
 
07:32:34.868 --> 07:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
striking the decrim statute it puts
 
07:32:37.350 --> 07:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
edible cannabis in a legal limbo
 
07:32:40.788 --> 07:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:42.788 --> 07:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
it restores the personal possession
 
07:32:44.708 --> 07:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
limit for cannabis infused products at
 
07:32:47.990 --> 07:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
300 milligrams of thc for adults 21 and
 
07:32:49.510 --> 07:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
older that's the exact same standard
 
07:32:51.270 --> 07:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
that already exists under
 
07:32:51.280 --> 07:32:53.190 align:start position:0%
that already exists under
decriminalization

07:32:53.190 --> 07:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
decriminalization
 
07:32:55.030 --> 07:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
so again this is a fix
 
07:32:57.270 --> 07:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
no more no less and i ask you to pass it
 
07:33:05.830 --> 07:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:08.628 --> 07:33:08.638 align:start position:0%

the

07:34:57.990 --> 07:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:34:59.510 --> 07:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment is about as simple as you
 
07:35:01.430 --> 07:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
can imagine instead of having
 
07:35:03.590 --> 07:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission set up a number of
 
07:35:06.070 --> 07:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
state-run liquor stores around sorry a
 
07:35:07.670 --> 07:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
number of state-run
 
07:35:09.750 --> 07:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana stores around the state it
 
07:35:11.830 --> 07:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
would just have private business
 
07:35:13.750 --> 07:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
sell it and dispensaries sell it in
 
07:35:16.628 --> 07:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
towns where the voters had approved the
 
07:35:19.030 --> 07:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
sale of cannabis
 
07:35:22.070 --> 07:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment 1286h would simply remove from
 
07:35:23.430 --> 07:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill the requirement that the
 
07:35:26.388 --> 07:35:26.398 align:start position:0%
liquor commission buy sell inventory and
 
07:35:28.548 --> 07:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
advertise marijuana instead of just
 
07:35:30.150 --> 07:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
letting private sellers and existing
 
07:35:33.430 --> 07:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
dispensaries sell cannabis
 
07:35:35.030 --> 07:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
this would still be under the regulation
 
07:35:37.030 --> 07:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
and oversight of the liquor commission
 
07:35:38.628 --> 07:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
and there are no other major policy
 
07:35:41.030 --> 07:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
changes under the law
 
07:35:42.628 --> 07:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
other than medical marijuana all
 
07:35:44.708 --> 07:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis products under this amendment
 
07:35:46.070 --> 07:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
would simply
 
07:35:48.388 --> 07:35:48.398 align:start position:0%
be subject to the 8.5 percent meals and
 
07:35:49.670 --> 07:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
07:35:51.590 --> 07:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
generating an estimated 44 million
 
07:35:53.270 --> 07:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a year according to the tax
 
07:35:53.280 --> 07:35:54.548 align:start position:0%
dollars a year according to the tax
foundation

07:35:54.548 --> 07:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
07:35:56.150 --> 07:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
07:35:58.388 --> 07:35:58.398 align:start position:0%
uh following these sales
 
07:36:00.310 --> 07:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
sales estimates state municipal
 
07:36:02.468 --> 07:36:02.478 align:start position:0%
governments would bring in an estimated
 
07:36:04.868 --> 07:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 million dollars in additional
 
07:36:06.868 --> 07:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
business and property taxes without
 
07:36:08.388 --> 07:36:08.398 align:start position:0%
having the state
 
07:36:10.830 --> 07:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
take a huge risk on another state-run
 
07:36:13.110 --> 07:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
enterprise compare that with the rosie
 
07:36:15.510 --> 07:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
estimates in the majority report
 
07:36:18.548 --> 07:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
of 30 million dollars a year if this new
 
07:36:21.190 --> 07:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
state-run monopoly doesn't end up like
 
07:36:24.230 --> 07:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
every other state-run monopoly
 
07:36:27.990 --> 07:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
by the way every hypothetical dollar
 
07:36:30.468 --> 07:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
of revenue in this in
 
07:36:32.150 --> 07:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the uh criminal justice version of the
 
07:36:34.548 --> 07:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill is earmarked in the bill
 
07:36:37.110 --> 07:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh plus tens of millions more
 
07:36:38.788 --> 07:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
so that there
 
07:36:40.388 --> 07:36:40.398 align:start position:0%
really couldn't be any possible way that
 
07:36:42.310 --> 07:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
i can see that there'd be revenue left
 
07:36:44.150 --> 07:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
for the general fund
 
07:36:45.910 --> 07:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
but let me be absolutely clear this
 
07:36:47.750 --> 07:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment simply would have private
 
07:36:50.628 --> 07:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
establishments taking all of the risks
 
07:36:52.628 --> 07:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
to have them buy sell an inventory
 
07:36:54.788 --> 07:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis rather than one top heavy
 
07:36:57.910 --> 07:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:59.590 --> 07:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
doing the work without this amendment
 
07:37:01.350 --> 07:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
the state would have to expend
 
07:37:03.750 --> 07:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note
 
07:37:06.868 --> 07:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
up front 7.9 million dollars plus
 
07:37:08.628 --> 07:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
another nine million dollars a year in
 
07:37:10.070 --> 07:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
07:37:12.948 --> 07:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
then proposes to transfer hypothetical
 
07:37:16.948 --> 07:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
profits of 25 million dollars to dhhs
 
07:37:19.430 --> 07:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
and millions more to state agencies
 
07:37:22.070 --> 07:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
on a perishable inventory estimated at
 
07:37:24.310 --> 07:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand dollars
 
07:37:26.388 --> 07:37:26.398 align:start position:0%
i cannot understand any business model
 
07:37:27.830 --> 07:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
that could work out this way nor
 
07:37:27.840 --> 07:37:28.868 align:start position:0%
that could work out this way nor
understand

07:37:28.868 --> 07:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:37:30.868 --> 07:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
why any republican would vote for
 
07:37:32.468 --> 07:37:32.478 align:start position:0%
something that runs completely contrary
 
07:37:33.990 --> 07:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the spirit and letter of the new
 
07:37:36.310 --> 07:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire gop platform and everything
 
07:37:38.230 --> 07:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
that we stand for
 
07:37:40.230 --> 07:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
with without this amendment
 
07:37:43.190 --> 07:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
the bill simply proposes to trade one
 
07:37:45.590 --> 07:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
failed soviet era policy mass
 
07:37:47.670 --> 07:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
incarceration with another
 
07:37:49.430 --> 07:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
soviet agriculture
 
07:37:51.030 --> 07:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
who's going to stand in or soviet
 
07:37:52.788 --> 07:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
grocery stores i should say who's going
 
07:37:54.388 --> 07:37:54.398 align:start position:0%
to stand in line two hours waiting for
 
07:37:54.398 --> 07:37:55.350 align:start position:0%
to stand in line two hours waiting for
weed

07:37:55.350 --> 07:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
weed
 
07:37:57.430 --> 07:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
no one if you can drive 20 minutes to
 
07:37:59.110 --> 07:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
the next state since
 
07:38:02.230 --> 07:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis is is legal to buy in almost
 
07:38:04.388 --> 07:38:04.398 align:start position:0%
every other part of the northeast mr
 
07:38:05.910 --> 07:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
speaker if someone came to you with this
 
07:38:07.430 --> 07:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
business plan asking for tens of
 
07:38:08.948 --> 07:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for a completely
 
07:38:11.350 --> 07:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
untested and unfeasible business model
 
07:38:13.910 --> 07:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
with no realistic way to turn a profit
 
07:38:15.910 --> 07:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
on just seven hundred thousand dollars
 
07:38:18.548 --> 07:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
in perishable inventory unlike the
 
07:38:20.388 --> 07:38:20.398 align:start position:0%
state-run liquor stores
 
07:38:22.150 --> 07:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
would you write them a check for over 18
 
07:38:23.670 --> 07:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
07:38:25.590 --> 07:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
not on your salary you wouldn't
 
07:38:27.510 --> 07:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
well i only make 22 cents an hour in
 
07:38:28.708 --> 07:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
this position
 
07:38:30.548 --> 07:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
and if i were a
 
07:38:33.270 --> 07:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
venture capitalist who approved this
 
07:38:34.868 --> 07:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
business plan in the private sector i
 
07:38:37.190 --> 07:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
would find myself making zero cents an
 
07:38:40.230 --> 07:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
hour because i would be fired
 
07:38:41.910 --> 07:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
but let's just imagine
 
07:38:44.150 --> 07:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
that every socialist activist in new
 
07:38:46.788 --> 07:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
england came to new hampshire's stoner
 
07:38:48.788 --> 07:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
palace to finally see soviet-style
 
07:38:50.628 --> 07:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
socialism working for the first time
 
07:38:52.468 --> 07:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
ever in history after seeing new
 
07:38:55.030 --> 07:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire spend over 1 million dollars a
 
07:38:57.430 --> 07:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
year on advertising according to the
 
07:38:58.868 --> 07:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note coming straight from the
 
07:39:01.430 --> 07:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
07:39:03.350 --> 07:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
suppose these trotskyites love new
 
07:39:05.030 --> 07:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire socialism so much that they
 
07:39:07.030 --> 07:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
decide to settle down here and get all
 
07:39:09.750 --> 07:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:11.750 --> 07:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
sorry get all their friends to buy from
 
07:39:14.150 --> 07:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
stoners palace i cannot see any
 
07:39:16.468 --> 07:39:16.478 align:start position:0%
realistic way that a state-run monopoly
 
07:39:18.948 --> 07:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
could possibly compete with hundreds
 
07:39:21.270 --> 07:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
of rapidly evolving innovative cannabis
 
07:39:23.590 --> 07:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
sellers in the northeast and thousands
 
07:39:25.030 --> 07:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
of e-commerce
 
07:39:27.190 --> 07:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
sites all over the country
 
07:39:29.030 --> 07:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
in my two decades living in the live
 
07:39:31.910 --> 07:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
free or die state i have seen many bills
 
07:39:33.430 --> 07:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
both as a member and as a private
 
07:39:36.230 --> 07:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
citizen attempting to create state-run
 
07:39:38.468 --> 07:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
banks commuter rail and other state-run
 
07:39:38.478 --> 07:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
banks commuter rail and other state-run
enterprises

07:39:39.830 --> 07:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
enterprises
 
07:39:41.510 --> 07:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they have all been defeated here
 
07:39:44.310 --> 07:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
because there is no public support for
 
07:39:46.868 --> 07:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
that brand of socialism even from the
 
07:39:46.878 --> 07:39:47.830 align:start position:0%
that brand of socialism even from the
hardened

07:39:47.830 --> 07:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
hardened
 
07:39:49.910 --> 07:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
socialist activists the state-run liquor
 
07:39:51.590 --> 07:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
stores are the first thing that
 
07:39:53.670 --> 07:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
left-wing activists
 
07:39:55.110 --> 07:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
complain to me
 
07:39:57.670 --> 07:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
when they move here without amendment
 
07:39:57.680 --> 07:39:59.190 align:start position:0%
when they move here without amendment
1286

1286
 
07:40:00.948 --> 07:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
we'd be setting a dangerous precedent
 
07:40:02.310 --> 07:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
that private business will now be
 
07:40:05.030 --> 07:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
replaced with state-run monopolies by
 
07:40:07.270 --> 07:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
whomever future government governors
 
07:40:09.270 --> 07:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
appoint without our input and without
 
07:40:10.628 --> 07:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
our say-so
 
07:40:13.110 --> 07:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
consider the track record of cost of
 
07:40:16.070 --> 07:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
other state-run monopolies
 
07:40:17.430 --> 07:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
twenty years ago when i moved here
 
07:40:19.430 --> 07:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
people complained that public schools
 
07:40:21.110 --> 07:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
were charging seven thousand dollars a
 
07:40:23.030 --> 07:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
year per student now it's almost twenty
 
07:40:26.388 --> 07:40:26.398 align:start position:0%

nine thousand dollars per year per
 
07:40:30.388 --> 07:40:30.398 align:start position:0%

07:40:32.150 --> 07:40:32.160 align:start position:0%

07:40:36.230 --> 07:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
when they get out it costs over sixty
 
07:40:37.670 --> 07:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
one thousand per year to put them on
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
welfare in section 8 because they can't
 
07:40:41.110 --> 07:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
get a job with a modern diploma and a

and every single post on citizens count

that make future reforms and future

changes difficult or impossible for
 
07:41:39.350 --> 07:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
example even though the state could make
 
07:41:41.830 --> 07:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
two to three times we've been told
 
07:41:43.750 --> 07:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
two to three times as much revenue by
 
07:41:45.510 --> 07:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
re-privatizing the state-run liquor

liquor
 
07:41:50.150 --> 07:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
that can never happen now because no one
 
07:41:52.388 --> 07:41:52.398 align:start position:0%
can take on that multi-million dollar
 
07:41:54.230 --> 07:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
political juggernaut and the complex
 
07:41:57.110 --> 07:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
system of rsas that has grown up around
 
07:42:00.230 --> 07:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
the state-run liquor stores
 
07:42:01.990 --> 07:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and won't this state-run enterprise also
 
07:42:03.990 --> 07:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
become political will decisions about
 
07:42:05.910 --> 07:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
its operation be as practical as those
 
07:42:08.310 --> 07:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
made by private business

07:42:18.868 --> 07:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
hey i ran into trouble earlier so i'm

just going to delete that
 
07:42:22.070 --> 07:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
no i'm not going to say it it's just

funny

07:42:23.270 --> 07:42:23.280 align:start position:0%

07:42:33.990 --> 07:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
time already imagine what will happen if
 
07:42:38.310 --> 07:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
we have perhaps 30 plus bills a year

the bills introduced here
 
07:42:54.230 --> 07:42:54.240 align:start position:0%

now be forced to sell only to the state
 
07:43:05.110 --> 07:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
as business owners warned
 
07:43:07.830 --> 07:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
at the ways and means hearing
 
07:43:09.190 --> 07:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
many worried that they would be put out

the state
 
07:43:22.070 --> 07:43:22.080 align:start position:0%

only for the initial license
 
07:43:34.628 --> 07:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
not for continuation
 
07:43:36.388 --> 07:43:36.398 align:start position:0%
and will the one million dollars a year
 
07:43:38.830 --> 07:43:38.840 align:start position:0%

promoting drug use the criminal justice
 
07:43:59.510 --> 07:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee recently rejected a similar
 
07:44:01.030 --> 07:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill my bill
 
07:44:02.948 --> 07:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
on the argument that business might
 
07:44:05.190 --> 07:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
advertise glass pipes and scales
 
07:44:08.150 --> 07:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
criminal justice can't have it both ways
 
07:44:10.070 --> 07:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
state promotion of drug use at taxpayer
 
07:44:12.868 --> 07:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
expense is perhaps the most unpopular
 
07:44:15.750 --> 07:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
policy ever considered by the house yet
 
07:44:17.590 --> 07:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
is still on the bill
 
07:44:19.510 --> 07:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
many of my republican colleagues now
 
07:44:22.310 --> 07:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
support re-legalization only as a tool
 
07:44:25.030 --> 07:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce drug use not promoted at
 
07:44:26.788 --> 07:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayer expense
 
07:44:28.788 --> 07:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
we were told repeatedly by majority on
 
07:44:30.230 --> 07:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
criminal justice to vote down other
 
07:44:31.910 --> 07:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana bills because they had some
 
07:44:33.270 --> 07:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
big compromise bill that they were
 
07:44:35.670 --> 07:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
working on and this monstrosity and it
 
07:44:38.150 --> 07:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
is a monstrosity
 
07:44:41.750 --> 07:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
is it and it needs to be amended
 
07:44:43.830 --> 07:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
the vote in ways and means was certainly
 
07:44:47.030 --> 07:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
not unanimous it was 12 to 10.
 
07:44:49.030 --> 07:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
with many of those who voted for it who
 
07:44:52.548 --> 07:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
voted ought to pass with amendment
 
07:44:54.070 --> 07:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
admitting both before and after the
 
07:44:55.910 --> 07:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing that they hate this version but
 
07:44:58.230 --> 07:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
they felt that they couldn't change it
 
07:44:59.590 --> 07:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
07:45:01.590 --> 07:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
is the worst idea since congress spent
 
07:45:03.190 --> 07:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
eight hundred fifty six thousand dollars
 
07:45:04.628 --> 07:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
to find out how long it would take to
 
07:45:06.468 --> 07:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
train lions to walk on a treadmill it
 
07:45:07.910 --> 07:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
took eight months
 
07:45:09.270 --> 07:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't take eight months to figure
 
07:45:10.628 --> 07:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
out we need to hit the green cannabis
 
07:45:13.110 --> 07:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
button on the amendment 1286
 
07:45:14.868 --> 07:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
to remove the socialist big government
 
07:45:17.190 --> 07:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill and simply convert
 
07:45:20.070 --> 07:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
it into a simple revenue bill
 
07:45:23.030 --> 07:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
better to get 65 million dollars a year
 
07:45:25.270 --> 07:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
with no risk to the state than maybe
 
07:45:25.280 --> 07:45:26.070 align:start position:0%
with no risk to the state than maybe
gain

07:45:26.070 --> 07:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
gain
 
07:45:29.350 --> 07:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
or lose 30 million dollars a year we
 
07:45:31.750 --> 07:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't make changes
 
07:45:34.230 --> 07:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the house because the senate might
 
07:45:35.750 --> 07:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
want changes
 
07:45:37.270 --> 07:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
we pass
 
07:45:37.280 --> 07:45:38.708 align:start position:0%
we pass
sorry

07:45:38.708 --> 07:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:45:40.388 --> 07:45:40.398 align:start position:0%
those we do not speak of
 
07:45:42.230 --> 07:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
we pass the house position and let those
 
07:45:44.150 --> 07:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
we do not speak of propose their own
 
07:45:46.548 --> 07:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
changes on the other side of the wall
 
07:45:48.468 --> 07:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
when has the house ever caved into the
 
07:45:50.948 --> 07:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
senate to senate demands or speculated
 
07:45:52.548 --> 07:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
about senate positions
 
07:45:54.468 --> 07:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
when has the house ever changed
 
07:45:56.788 --> 07:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
legislation based on rumors about what
 
07:45:59.350 --> 07:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
the senate might add
 
07:46:01.510 --> 07:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
let senators speak for themselves press
 
07:46:03.670 --> 07:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
the green button and help us downsize
 
07:46:03.680 --> 07:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
the green button and help us downsize
government

07:46:11.270 --> 07:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:12.830 --> 07:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
a division has been
 
07:46:15.110 --> 07:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
requested members will start taking your
 
07:46:16.868 --> 07:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
seats we're down to the last speaker
 
07:46:21.270 --> 07:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:23.030 --> 07:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:46:25.110 --> 07:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to
 
07:46:25.120 --> 07:46:25.830 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to
the

07:46:25.830 --> 07:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:46:30.548 --> 07:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:32.230 --> 07:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take as much time to
 
07:46:33.510 --> 07:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
respond to every single point that was
 
07:46:34.788 --> 07:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
just made
 
07:46:36.468 --> 07:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
but i heard it was the one of the points
 
07:46:38.868 --> 07:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
was that it was the most unpopular
 
07:46:40.548 --> 07:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
proposal of all time i just want to
 
07:46:42.150 --> 07:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
point out we there was a division vote
 
07:46:44.310 --> 07:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
on the first go round and it passed this
 
07:46:49.830 --> 07:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
body by a vote of 235 yays to 119 nays
 
07:46:52.150 --> 07:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
so it did pass once already
 
07:46:54.388 --> 07:46:54.398 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe it's the most uh
 
07:46:56.468 --> 07:46:56.478 align:start position:0%
least popular of all time
 
07:46:56.478 --> 07:46:57.430 align:start position:0%
least popular of all time
but

07:46:57.430 --> 07:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:46:59.270 --> 07:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to being a nine and a half
 
07:47:01.590 --> 07:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
page floor amendment that has did not go
 
07:47:03.590 --> 07:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
through any committee if you go to the
 
07:47:07.270 --> 07:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:11.750 --> 07:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see where the rooms and meals tax
 
07:47:14.868 --> 07:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:17.670 --> 07:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
we uh i believe this body and it was
 
07:47:19.190 --> 07:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
something that we took a lot of pride in
 
07:47:20.708 --> 07:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
lowering the rooms and meals tax to
 
07:47:22.150 --> 07:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent
 
07:47:23.590 --> 07:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
so this would be raising the rooms and
 
07:47:25.030 --> 07:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
meals tax
 
07:47:27.030 --> 07:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
unrelated to canvas
 
07:47:29.830 --> 07:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
it would be increasing it back to nine
 
07:47:32.948 --> 07:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
with that being said by having cannabis
 
07:47:35.190 --> 07:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
be taxed under the rooms and meals tax
 
07:47:35.200 --> 07:47:36.788 align:start position:0%
be taxed under the rooms and meals tax
which

07:47:36.788 --> 07:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:47:39.830 --> 07:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
is neither a room nor a meal
 
07:47:41.670 --> 07:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
you are essentially
 
07:47:43.510 --> 07:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
starting to convert that
 
07:47:45.670 --> 07:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax into a full-on
 
07:47:49.190 --> 07:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
retail sales tax this is the beginning
 
07:47:51.190 --> 07:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
it will start with this floor amendment
 
07:47:51.200 --> 07:47:53.350 align:start position:0%
it will start with this floor amendment
today

07:47:53.350 --> 07:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:47:55.430 --> 07:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's where it will begin because now
 
07:47:57.350 --> 07:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
we have a retail product
 
07:47:59.270 --> 07:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we are selling
 
07:48:01.350 --> 07:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
in a retail store
 
07:48:03.190 --> 07:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
calling it we're trying not to call it a
 
07:48:06.150 --> 07:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
sales tax but it is a sales tax so
 
07:48:08.388 --> 07:48:08.398 align:start position:0%
eventually your rooms and meals tax will
 
07:48:10.310 --> 07:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
be a full-on retail sales tax that's
 
07:48:11.510 --> 07:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
what this
 
07:48:13.670 --> 07:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment would actually
 
07:48:13.680 --> 07:48:14.948 align:start position:0%
amendment would actually
do

07:48:14.948 --> 07:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:48:16.468 --> 07:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
and for that reason
 
07:48:16.478 --> 07:48:17.670 align:start position:0%
and for that reason
please

07:48:17.670 --> 07:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:48:21.270 --> 07:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
push that red button do not raise taxes

the house will come to order
 
07:49:49.830 --> 07:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
07:49:55.270 --> 07:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:58.548 --> 07:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
07:50:00.150 --> 07:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
07:50:07.590 --> 07:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:09.350 --> 07:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:50:11.190 --> 07:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that this amendment preserves
 
07:50:12.628 --> 07:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
the great progress
 
07:50:14.230 --> 07:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
this body has made in the last several
 
07:50:14.240 --> 07:50:15.030 align:start position:0%
this body has made in the last several
years

07:50:15.030 --> 07:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:50:17.430 --> 07:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
as it reduces the penalties for the use
 
07:50:19.350 --> 07:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
and possession of the plant that we seek
 
07:50:20.948 --> 07:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
to legalize
 
07:50:22.468 --> 07:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
if i know that putting cannabis under
 
07:50:23.750 --> 07:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax would mean
 
07:50:25.510 --> 07:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
revenue is estimated in the tens of
 
07:50:27.990 --> 07:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
millions plus an extra 20 30 million in
 
07:50:30.230 --> 07:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
business and property tax revenue
 
07:50:32.070 --> 07:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
if i know that this amendment eases
 
07:50:35.110 --> 07:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that members across the aisle
 
07:50:37.430 --> 07:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
may have about a liquor commission
 
07:50:39.350 --> 07:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
monopoly on cannabis
 
07:50:40.948 --> 07:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know that i
 
07:50:43.830 --> 07:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
like two-thirds of this body and 70
 
07:50:45.830 --> 07:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the state of new hampshire
 
07:50:48.468 --> 07:50:48.478 align:start position:0%

07:50:48.478 --> 07:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
just want to finally get cannabis
legalized

07:50:49.990 --> 07:50:50.000 align:start position:0%

07:50:51.910 --> 07:50:51.920 align:start position:0%

to move the money from the rooms and
 
07:51:11.990 --> 07:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
meals tax fund into the cannabis control
 
07:51:14.468 --> 07:51:14.478 align:start position:0%

this bill as written is nothing more
 
07:51:29.030 --> 07:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
than a gateway tax to a full-blown
 
07:51:31.830 --> 07:51:31.840 align:start position:0%

07:54:27.510 --> 07:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
07:54:29.350 --> 07:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative muller
 
07:54:34.310 --> 07:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:36.230 --> 07:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:54:37.590 --> 07:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
if i know that the ways and means
 
07:54:39.110 --> 07:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee worked very hard to put
 
07:54:42.070 --> 07:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
safeguards into 1598 but this bill has
 
07:54:44.310 --> 07:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
not proven its fiscal solvency and is
 
07:54:46.388 --> 07:54:46.398 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time
 
07:54:47.750 --> 07:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that new hampshire has
 
07:54:49.670 --> 07:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
already codified targeted solutions to
 
07:54:51.030 --> 07:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
address medical marijuana and
 
07:54:51.040 --> 07:54:52.388 align:start position:0%
address medical marijuana and
decriminalization

07:54:52.388 --> 07:54:52.398 align:start position:0%
decriminalization
 
07:54:55.110 --> 07:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
but full legalization has proven harmful
 
07:54:57.510 --> 07:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
to 18 other states
 
07:54:59.430 --> 07:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know that nashua and manchester
 
07:55:02.310 --> 07:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
already struggling with 110 percent
 
07:55:04.150 --> 07:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
increase in drug overdoses this past
 
07:55:07.590 --> 07:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
year alone and finally
 
07:55:09.750 --> 07:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
if i know that during a recent
 
07:55:11.910 --> 07:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on legalization our governor
 
07:55:14.468 --> 07:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
was quoted as saying quote i have talked
 
07:55:16.788 --> 07:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
to a lot of governors who said boy it
 
07:55:18.708 --> 07:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
has been a real problem
 
07:55:20.868 --> 07:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to
 
07:55:23.670 --> 07:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
table 1598.
 
07:55:25.350 --> 07:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
gee i recognize representative conley
 
07:55:28.150 --> 07:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
07:55:30.230 --> 07:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that this
 
07:55:32.150 --> 07:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill has already passed this house by an
 
07:55:34.788 --> 07:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
almost veto proof margin if i know that
 
07:55:36.070 --> 07:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would raise millions of
 
07:55:38.388 --> 07:55:38.398 align:start position:0%
dollars for property tax relief the
 
07:55:39.910 --> 07:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
state retirement system and law
 
07:55:39.920 --> 07:55:41.190 align:start position:0%
state retirement system and law
enforcement

07:55:41.190 --> 07:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
07:55:42.708 --> 07:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that
 
07:55:44.468 --> 07:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road for
 
07:55:45.750 --> 07:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
another year
 
07:55:47.670 --> 07:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
does a disservice to the residents of
 
07:55:49.910 --> 07:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state who just want us to get this
 
07:55:49.920 --> 07:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
the state who just want us to get this
done

07:55:51.670 --> 07:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
done
 
07:55:52.868 --> 07:55:52.878 align:start position:0%

07:55:54.230 --> 07:55:54.240 align:start position:0%

07:57:59.280 --> 07:58:02.468 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is that isn't that in
opposition

07:58:02.468 --> 07:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:04.388 --> 07:58:04.398 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker now i really will
 
07:58:05.590 --> 07:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
be brief
 
07:58:05.600 --> 07:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
be brief
uh

07:58:07.670 --> 07:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:58:10.548 --> 07:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to
 
07:58:12.948 --> 07:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1598
 
07:58:14.230 --> 07:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
07:58:16.230 --> 07:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
and for one very simple reason as i
 
07:58:19.030 --> 07:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned during my previous statements
 
07:58:22.310 --> 07:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the rough estimate of total sales
 
07:58:24.070 --> 07:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
by some outside groups would be about
 
07:58:26.468 --> 07:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
400 to 500 million dollars a year
 
07:58:29.670 --> 07:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
so that that's probably true but that
 
07:58:31.350 --> 07:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be not only larger than the entire
 
07:58:32.708 --> 07:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
prison industry would be many times
 
07:58:34.628 --> 07:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
larger than the entire prison industry
 
07:58:36.070 --> 07:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and as the figures that i brought up
 
07:58:39.030 --> 07:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
before that the cost per inmate has gone
 
07:58:40.628 --> 07:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
from in my time in new hampshire has
 
07:58:41.990 --> 07:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
gone from nine thousand dollars a year
 
07:58:43.670 --> 07:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
per inmate to sixty thousand dollars a
 
07:58:46.628 --> 07:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:48.548 --> 07:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
this is six times more expensive in the
 
07:58:50.468 --> 07:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
last twenty years the cost of government
 
07:58:52.948 --> 07:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
goes up and up and up and up and up
 
07:58:55.510 --> 07:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
if members have any thought of maybe one
 
07:58:57.350 --> 07:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
day legalizing or coming up with any
 
07:58:58.708 --> 07:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
other policy
 
07:59:00.948 --> 07:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely this would be
 
07:59:02.948 --> 07:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely the biggest most powerful
 
07:59:05.350 --> 07:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
political constituency that we would
 
07:59:07.430 --> 07:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
ever have to fight against to make any
 
07:59:10.788 --> 07:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
kind of political change in the future
 
07:59:13.590 --> 07:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you as every
 
07:59:13.600 --> 07:59:14.548 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you as every
single

07:59:14.548 --> 07:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
single
 
07:59:17.030 --> 07:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
activist every marijuana policy activist
 
07:59:20.868 --> 07:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:23.910 --> 07:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
group the dispensaries
 
07:59:25.830 --> 07:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
a marijuana policy project all of them
 
07:59:27.830 --> 07:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
asked they asked ways and means to vote
 
07:59:29.590 --> 07:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
this down to stop this because they know
 
07:59:31.590 --> 07:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
about the long-term the long-term
 
07:59:33.830 --> 07:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of going down
 
07:59:35.750 --> 07:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
this path i don't know of any other
 
07:59:38.388 --> 07:59:38.398 align:start position:0%
state that has done this with cannabis
 
07:59:39.990 --> 07:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
we have seen this with other types of
 
07:59:42.230 --> 07:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
state-run monopolies and
 
07:59:44.468 --> 07:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
it it should never be we'll never have a
 
07:59:47.430 --> 07:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
realistic chance to privatize this
 
07:59:49.830 --> 07:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
once this gets deep rooted
 
07:59:53.670 --> 07:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:54.788 --> 07:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
the member from sugar hill
 
07:59:56.388 --> 07:59:56.398 align:start position:0%
representative egan is recognized to
 
08:00:03.030 --> 08:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:04.628 --> 08:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:00:06.388 --> 08:00:06.398 align:start position:0%
i did come here with the intention to
 
08:00:08.468 --> 08:00:08.478 align:start position:0%
speak against this bill but my friends
 
08:00:11.270 --> 08:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
my colleagues i'm at a quandary
 
08:00:13.510 --> 08:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not a fan of big government yes i'm
 
08:00:15.190 --> 08:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
a democrat saying i'm not a fan of big
 
08:00:17.510 --> 08:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
government surprise surprise
 
08:00:20.230 --> 08:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not a fan of state-run monopolies
 
08:00:23.670 --> 08:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
but i am a fan of listening to the 70 70
 
08:00:23.680 --> 08:00:24.868 align:start position:0%
but i am a fan of listening to the 70 70
75

08:00:24.868 --> 08:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
75
 
08:00:26.868 --> 08:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
maybe 80 percent and growing
 
08:00:29.910 --> 08:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
constituents in our state that ask
 
08:00:31.110 --> 08:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
for us
 
08:00:33.270 --> 08:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
to legalize cannabis
 
08:00:35.350 --> 08:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
i've been very outspoken on both sides
 
08:00:37.430 --> 08:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the aisle about my interest to
 
08:00:39.430 --> 08:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis
 
08:00:43.110 --> 08:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
i say if not now then when
 
08:00:45.830 --> 08:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
we need to send a message to the body on
 
08:00:48.388 --> 08:00:48.398 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall for them to
 
08:00:51.190 --> 08:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
tell our constituents 75 80 percent of
 
08:00:51.200 --> 08:00:52.310 align:start position:0%
tell our constituents 75 80 percent of
them

08:00:52.310 --> 08:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
08:00:52.320 --> 08:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
them
that

08:00:53.510 --> 08:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:00:56.708 --> 08:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
they are not being heard
 
08:00:57.830 --> 08:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
let the
 
08:00:59.830 --> 08:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
body on the other side of the wall tell
 
08:01:03.430 --> 08:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
people that 80 percent of them their
 
08:01:06.548 --> 08:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
opinions do not matter
 
08:01:09.510 --> 08:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
i ask you to vote in favor of house bill
 
08:01:12.070 --> 08:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
1598 so that we can do the business that
 
08:01:14.070 --> 08:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
the people of the state of new hampshire
 
08:01:16.388 --> 08:01:16.398 align:start position:0%
sent us here to do which is to legalize
 
08:01:16.398 --> 08:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
sent us here to do which is to legalize
cannabis

08:01:17.590 --> 08:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
08:01:19.590 --> 08:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
create revenue for our state create
 
08:01:21.270 --> 08:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
economic development
 
08:01:23.590 --> 08:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
and begin to move on with other business
 
08:01:25.270 --> 08:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
that this body has
 
08:01:26.310 --> 08:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
08:01:28.548 --> 08:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
does the member yield for a question
 
08:01:29.990 --> 08:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
i do
 
08:01:34.868 --> 08:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:36.230 --> 08:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank the
 
08:01:38.708 --> 08:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
member for taking my question
 
08:01:40.388 --> 08:01:40.398 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding would you agree
 
08:01:42.868 --> 08:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
that this the type of state monopoly
 
08:01:44.708 --> 08:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill
 
08:01:46.388 --> 08:01:46.398 align:start position:0%
has not been tried in the other 18
 
08:01:48.788 --> 08:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized cannabis and
 
08:01:52.070 --> 08:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
thus would be risky bureaucratic costly
 
08:01:54.310 --> 08:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
and potentially turn this program into a
 
08:01:56.070 --> 08:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
boon goggle boondoggle for the state of
 
08:01:58.628 --> 08:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
08:02:01.510 --> 08:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for the question
 
08:02:03.510 --> 08:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
i do have an issue with that
 
08:02:06.468 --> 08:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
most all not most all states in the
 
08:02:08.388 --> 08:02:08.398 align:start position:0%
united states that have legalized
 
08:02:09.990 --> 08:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis have a cannabis control
 
08:02:11.670 --> 08:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
commission that allows them to have
 
08:02:14.468 --> 08:02:14.478 align:start position:0%
oversight over the industry
 
08:02:16.150 --> 08:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns with this bill is
 
08:02:18.070 --> 08:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we do not have that
 
08:02:19.590 --> 08:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's something that our
 
08:02:21.190 --> 08:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of the wall
 
08:02:24.388 --> 08:02:24.398 align:start position:0%
can take up when we send them this bill
 
08:02:26.468 --> 08:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
we do need to have
 
08:02:28.548 --> 08:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
a clear
 
08:02:30.548 --> 08:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
oversight of
 
08:02:30.558 --> 08:02:32.070 align:start position:0%
oversight of
regulation

08:02:32.070 --> 08:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
08:02:33.590 --> 08:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
separate from the folks that sell the
 
08:02:34.868 --> 08:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
product that's what we've been doing
 
08:02:36.708 --> 08:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
here in the united states for three
 
08:02:38.948 --> 08:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
almost 300 years we have regulation over
 
08:02:38.958 --> 08:02:41.110 align:start position:0%
almost 300 years we have regulation over
sales

08:02:41.110 --> 08:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
sales
 
08:02:43.190 --> 08:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
so there is a concern that i have that
 
08:02:44.548 --> 08:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
was probably one of the main concerns
 
08:02:47.910 --> 08:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i was not in favor of the state
 
08:02:51.590 --> 08:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
oriented business model that has
 
08:02:53.590 --> 08:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill has been built on
 
08:02:54.708 --> 08:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
08:02:57.030 --> 08:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
again at the end of the day as i sat
 
08:02:58.468 --> 08:02:58.478 align:start position:0%
here for the last
 
08:02:59.990 --> 08:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
three hours thinking about what i was
 
08:03:01.350 --> 08:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
08:03:04.388 --> 08:03:04.398 align:start position:0%
i thought who sent me here it's the fine
 
08:03:06.868 --> 08:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
people from sugar hill and franconia and
 
08:03:09.110 --> 08:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
lisbon and lyman and monroe who are
 
08:03:11.910 --> 08:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
farmers and hunters and hard-working
 
08:03:14.868 --> 08:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
north country folks who have said to me
 
08:03:16.868 --> 08:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again whether
 
08:03:20.628 --> 08:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
they're bankers or farmers or educators
 
08:03:20.638 --> 08:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
they're bankers or farmers or educators
that

08:03:21.510 --> 08:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:03:24.230 --> 08:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of legalized cannabis we
 
08:03:26.388 --> 08:03:26.398 align:start position:0%
look silly compared to maine and
 
08:03:29.350 --> 08:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and now vermont and canada
 
08:03:31.190 --> 08:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
and there are state-run stores in nova
 
08:03:34.070 --> 08:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
scotia that we can look as a model
 
08:03:36.150 --> 08:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day what is my job
 
08:03:37.510 --> 08:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
not to tell you
 
08:03:39.990 --> 08:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
what i think and what i feel but to do
 
08:03:42.548 --> 08:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
what the people voted me here to do
 
08:03:44.708 --> 08:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
which is to represent their viewpoint
 
08:03:47.350 --> 08:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
that 75 to 80 percent of them
 
08:03:49.990 --> 08:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
want legalized cannabis
 
08:03:55.430 --> 08:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:58.548 --> 08:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:03:59.670 --> 08:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
the member from londonderry
 
08:04:01.350 --> 08:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative baldassaro is recognized
 
08:04:02.628 --> 08:04:02.638 align:start position:0%

in my life and i've had it all around me
 
08:04:24.150 --> 08:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
many times i actually voted against

the way
 
08:04:35.110 --> 08:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
on my mind there because this could be
 
08:04:39.030 --> 08:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:41.510 --> 08:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine who passed away uh

many many years i won't you keep that in
 
08:04:52.708 --> 08:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
mind when we do cast his vote

he he really did support this here
 
08:04:59.030 --> 08:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
the marijuana bill we all talk about a
 
08:05:01.510 --> 08:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
monopoly of monopoly monopoly you know

something for 15 years that's all i
 
08:05:05.030 --> 08:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
heard the constitution says the monopoly
 
08:05:07.430 --> 08:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
i hear people reps come and go in here
 
08:05:09.750 --> 08:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
but you want to know something cable is
 
08:05:11.350 --> 08:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
a monopoly
 
08:05:14.548 --> 08:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
other areas here internet alcohol we
 
08:05:17.270 --> 08:05:17.280 align:start position:0%

08:05:23.270 --> 08:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to tell you one thing
 
08:05:24.548 --> 08:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
if you
 
08:05:26.070 --> 08:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
let this die
 
08:05:28.468 --> 08:05:28.478 align:start position:0%
and you're a big marijuana supporter
 
08:05:31.190 --> 08:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is the nose under the tent
 
08:05:33.510 --> 08:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
this is your opportunity to get the nose
 
08:05:36.388 --> 08:05:36.398 align:start position:0%
under the tent get something past where
 
08:05:37.990 --> 08:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here and i don't know how true it is
 
08:05:39.830 --> 08:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm hearing somebody's gonna let it
 
08:05:42.150 --> 08:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
go without a signature okay this is
 
08:05:44.628 --> 08:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
election year you finally have an
 
08:05:47.990 --> 08:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pass something
 
08:05:48.000 --> 08:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pass something
something

08:05:49.670 --> 08:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
08:05:52.230 --> 08:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
if you do not get this here going and
 
08:05:54.548 --> 08:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
this does not pass this year
 
08:05:57.350 --> 08:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
you get a governor who gets reelected
 
08:05:59.430 --> 08:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
election time's over you know all the
 
08:06:01.030 --> 08:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
game in this business
 
08:06:02.788 --> 08:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
you'll never get it again it will be
 
08:06:05.110 --> 08:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
vetoed and vetoed and vetoed
 
08:06:07.350 --> 08:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
so you might as well make a tough
 
08:06:09.910 --> 08:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
decision here today the house has voted
 
08:06:12.468 --> 08:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
this in many times do i like the state
 
08:06:15.590 --> 08:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
involved in this here hell no i don't
 
08:06:17.430 --> 08:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
but you want to know something
 
08:06:19.430 --> 08:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
you got no choice i either you want
 
08:06:21.750 --> 08:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana you don't you can't have the
 
08:06:24.788 --> 08:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
whole pie we have to take a little piece
 
08:06:26.548 --> 08:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
at a time
 
08:06:29.110 --> 08:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
later on you come back and you fix it
 
08:06:31.430 --> 08:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
you get add more to it you do whatever
 
08:06:33.590 --> 08:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
you got to do but you got to get the
 
08:06:37.030 --> 08:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
nose under the tent and if you don't
 
08:06:38.628 --> 08:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
then you failed
 
08:06:40.628 --> 08:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's you're not never going to have it
 
08:06:42.070 --> 08:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to lose sleep i'll be in
 
08:06:45.030 --> 08:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
florida where it's passed i think but
 
08:06:47.590 --> 08:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
so i recommend
 
08:06:49.910 --> 08:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you really deep
 
08:06:52.548 --> 08:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
think deep down inside your heart and
 
08:06:55.830 --> 08:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
realize do i want it or do i not
 
08:06:58.388 --> 08:06:58.398 align:start position:0%
do i care and listen to this garbage
 
08:07:00.468 --> 08:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
about it's a monopoly when it's all over
 
08:07:02.468 --> 08:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire monopoly we're a small
 
08:07:06.548 --> 08:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
state we do not have a tax revenue
 
08:07:09.350 --> 08:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you want sales tax payroll tax and
 
08:07:11.510 --> 08:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
vote this down
 
08:07:12.830 --> 08:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
vote it down
 
08:07:15.190 --> 08:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
eventually this state is going to run
 
08:07:17.270 --> 08:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
out of other people's money this is
 
08:07:17.280 --> 08:07:18.310 align:start position:0%
out of other people's money this is
choice

08:07:18.310 --> 08:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
choice
 
08:07:20.628 --> 08:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
money right that we got going on right
 
08:07:20.638 --> 08:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
money right that we got going on right
now

08:07:21.590 --> 08:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
08:07:24.310 --> 08:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
so if anything for the former minority
 
08:07:26.468 --> 08:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
leader i would say this should be at
 
08:07:29.030 --> 08:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
least over 300 or nothing or whatever we
 
08:07:31.910 --> 08:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
got here thank you
 
08:07:34.310 --> 08:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
chair recognizer representative connerk
 
08:07:39.190 --> 08:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:41.750 --> 08:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
08:07:43.750 --> 08:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm also torn
 
08:07:45.750 --> 08:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
because as many of you know i have
 
08:07:48.868 --> 08:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
favored cannabis legalization for years
 
08:07:50.548 --> 08:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
and i sponsored a bill to do so in the
 
08:07:50.558 --> 08:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
and i sponsored a bill to do so in the
past

08:07:52.150 --> 08:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
past
 
08:07:53.670 --> 08:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
my seat number
 
08:08:00.708 --> 08:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:02.310 --> 08:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i was informed that that was not a
 
08:08:03.910 --> 08:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
coincidence and now that i have your
 
08:08:05.590 --> 08:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
attention we can carry on with the rest
 
08:08:07.110 --> 08:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the information
 
08:08:08.948 --> 08:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is though i rise to
 
08:08:11.830 --> 08:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
point out the negative impact of hb 1598
 
08:08:14.388 --> 08:08:14.398 align:start position:0%
on the therapeutic cannabis program
 
08:08:16.628 --> 08:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i serve as the chair of
 
08:08:18.150 --> 08:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
08:08:19.590 --> 08:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
08:08:21.110 --> 08:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
that board is charged with medical
 
08:08:22.150 --> 08:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
oversight to the new hampshire
 
08:08:24.468 --> 08:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and this
 
08:08:25.910 --> 08:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
year the board knowing that there are a
 
08:08:27.910 --> 08:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
lot of various legalization bills coming
 
08:08:27.920 --> 08:08:28.788 align:start position:0%
lot of various legalization bills coming
up

08:08:28.788 --> 08:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
up
 
08:08:31.270 --> 08:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
passed a resolution that stated quote
 
08:08:33.590 --> 08:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
any bill legalizing cannabis for adult
 
08:08:36.070 --> 08:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
use in new hampshire should be evaluated
 
08:08:37.830 --> 08:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
to determine its impacts on the
 
08:08:39.830 --> 08:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
08:08:42.070 --> 08:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program is
 
08:08:44.468 --> 08:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
valuable and must be preserved
 
08:08:47.750 --> 08:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
if adult legalization passes
 
08:08:47.760 --> 08:08:48.548 align:start position:0%
if adult legalization passes
now

08:08:48.548 --> 08:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
now
 
08:08:50.310 --> 08:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the rest of my statement though i
 
08:08:52.708 --> 08:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
will be speaking for myself
 
08:08:54.628 --> 08:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
the board did not make a specific
 
08:08:57.910 --> 08:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation on hb1598
 
08:09:00.230 --> 08:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
as they did not have the opportunity to
 
08:09:04.708 --> 08:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:06.070 --> 08:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
now that i really have your attention
 
08:09:07.830 --> 08:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you the details about it the
 
08:09:09.468 --> 08:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
issue is that
 
08:09:11.830 --> 08:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
hb1598 will endanger the existence of
 
08:09:13.190 --> 08:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
08:09:15.110 --> 08:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
remember that the purpose of therapeutic
 
08:09:16.708 --> 08:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis is really very different than
 
08:09:18.868 --> 08:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis
 
08:09:20.868 --> 08:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's the alternative treatment center
 
08:09:23.750 --> 08:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time counseling patients
 
08:09:25.830 --> 08:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
reviewing their medical condition their
 
08:09:27.750 --> 08:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
previous treatments their previous
 
08:09:29.270 --> 08:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
experience with cannabis and their
 
08:09:30.948 --> 08:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
treatment goals
 
08:09:33.430 --> 08:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
they have a robust education program for
 
08:09:35.830 --> 08:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
their for their patients regarding risks
 
08:09:39.350 --> 08:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
safety dosing roots of administration
 
08:09:41.430 --> 08:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
the patient is then started at a low
 
08:09:43.990 --> 08:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
dose and under supervision is titrated
 
08:09:46.788 --> 08:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
slowly upward to reach the desired
 
08:09:48.628 --> 08:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic effect
 
08:09:51.670 --> 08:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
without the unwanted effect
 
08:09:54.548 --> 08:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
of intoxication
 
08:09:56.788 --> 08:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
as a result the atcs also have to stock
 
08:09:58.468 --> 08:09:58.478 align:start position:0%
a really broad range of products
 
08:10:01.030 --> 08:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
oriented to the medical population in
 
08:10:01.040 --> 08:10:02.110 align:start position:0%
oriented to the medical population in
particular

08:10:02.110 --> 08:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
particular
 
08:10:04.310 --> 08:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
non-intoxicating strains of cannabis
 
08:10:06.788 --> 08:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
with varying concentrations of thc and
 
08:10:09.110 --> 08:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
cbd along with different delivery
 
08:10:11.190 --> 08:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
methods such as topicals and
 
08:10:13.430 --> 08:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
suppositories which you don't find in a
 
08:10:15.750 --> 08:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
recreational store to meet the needs of
 
08:10:17.350 --> 08:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
different patients
 
08:10:19.430 --> 08:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
high potency products are going to be
 
08:10:21.110 --> 08:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
available for certain patients in
 
08:10:22.708 --> 08:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
certain conditions
 
08:10:25.750 --> 08:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
now all of these factors will create
 
08:10:28.468 --> 08:10:28.478 align:start position:0%
unique costs for the atc which will not
 
08:10:32.468 --> 08:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
be faced by their recreational stores
 
08:10:34.388 --> 08:10:34.398 align:start position:0%
okay minor problem except then when you
 
08:10:37.030 --> 08:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
combine that with a lack of taxation
 
08:10:37.910 --> 08:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
08:10:40.150 --> 08:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
intention of rock bottom prices to
 
08:10:42.548 --> 08:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
undercut the regional price of cannabis
 
08:10:45.030 --> 08:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to leave the atc's unable
 
08:10:47.670 --> 08:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
to compete on price
 
08:10:49.910 --> 08:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
patients will leave the program
 
08:10:51.510 --> 08:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be for the cheaper products that
 
08:10:53.910 --> 08:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
they can get at the recreational stores
 
08:10:55.830 --> 08:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
that'll jeopardize the atcs and the
 
08:10:57.990 --> 08:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program but
 
08:11:00.230 --> 08:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
importantly it will leave the patients
 
08:11:02.468 --> 08:11:02.478 align:start position:0%
without the full spectrum of products
 
08:11:03.590 --> 08:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
they need
 
08:11:05.830 --> 08:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
and without guidance and without
 
08:11:08.788 --> 08:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
education and without the supervision
 
08:11:10.788 --> 08:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
i had suggested at one point to the ways
 
08:11:12.468 --> 08:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
and means committee not to the whole
 
08:11:14.230 --> 08:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
committee but to a few select members
 
08:11:16.468 --> 08:11:16.478 align:start position:0%
that a solution might be
 
08:11:18.388 --> 08:11:18.398 align:start position:0%
to set aside some of the revenue from
 
08:11:20.948 --> 08:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
the recreational program to simply
 
08:11:24.150 --> 08:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
support the atc sufficiently to allow
 
08:11:26.548 --> 08:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
the atcs to meet the price point of the
 
08:11:29.350 --> 08:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
state recreational stores but such a
 
08:11:31.510 --> 08:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
safeguard was not inserted
 
08:11:35.590 --> 08:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
so in summary hb 1598 does not protect
 
08:11:37.830 --> 08:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
our therapeutic cannabis program it
 
08:11:41.110 --> 08:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
places it in jeopardy the profusion of
 
08:11:43.510 --> 08:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
floor amendments we see on this bill
 
08:11:45.590 --> 08:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
strongly suggests that this bill still
 
08:11:47.590 --> 08:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of work and it's for those
 
08:11:49.750 --> 08:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that i even though i like i'm in
 
08:11:51.910 --> 08:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
favor of legalization i still oppose
 
08:11:54.948 --> 08:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
otpa on this bill and suggest interim
 
08:11:56.388 --> 08:11:56.398 align:start position:0%
studies so we can work out these
 
08:11:58.468 --> 08:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
problems and come up with a good bill
 
08:11:59.750 --> 08:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't trust the people on the
 
08:12:01.510 --> 08:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall to fix all these
 
08:12:04.788 --> 08:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:11.350 --> 08:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:13.430 --> 08:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
08:12:13.440 --> 08:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in support
of

08:12:15.270 --> 08:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
08:12:17.510 --> 08:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
hb 5988 the committee's recommendation
 
08:12:19.510 --> 08:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass as amended
 
08:12:22.788 --> 08:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
in regards to the atcs there was no
 
08:12:25.590 --> 08:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
actual physical data or information
 
08:12:27.830 --> 08:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
presented to the criminal justice and
 
08:12:29.830 --> 08:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
public safety committee or to the
 
08:12:31.910 --> 08:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
house ways and means committee
 
08:12:34.070 --> 08:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
to suggest how many patients who are
 
08:12:37.430 --> 08:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
legitimately receiving medical treatment
 
08:12:38.948 --> 08:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
would all of a sudden
 
08:12:42.150 --> 08:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
stop receiving that legitimate medical
 
08:12:44.310 --> 08:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and all of a sudden resort to
 
08:12:47.110 --> 08:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
recreational drug use if hb 1598 would
 
08:12:49.030 --> 08:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
become law
 
08:12:50.948 --> 08:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
there was also no information presented
 
08:12:52.388 --> 08:12:52.398 align:start position:0%
to either committee
 
08:12:54.310 --> 08:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
about how many patients would have to be
 
08:12:54.320 --> 08:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
about how many patients would have to be
lost

08:12:55.430 --> 08:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
lost
 
08:12:58.150 --> 08:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
to the atcs in order for the atc to no
 
08:13:02.230 --> 08:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:04.708 --> 08:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
the only opposition that was really
 
08:13:06.868 --> 08:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
explained or that how it would hurt the
 
08:13:09.110 --> 08:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
adcs is that it
 
08:13:09.120 --> 08:13:09.830 align:start position:0%
adcs is that it
the

08:13:09.830 --> 08:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:13:12.388 --> 08:13:12.398 align:start position:0%
policy put forth by hp 1598 would
 
08:13:15.190 --> 08:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
compete with the existing monopoly that
 
08:13:16.708 --> 08:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
the atc's have
 
08:13:18.548 --> 08:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
on the medical industry
 
08:13:21.190 --> 08:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
as i said existing monopoly that exists
 
08:13:22.468 --> 08:13:22.478 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire state constitution
 
08:13:24.708 --> 08:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
does not permit a private monopoly such
 
08:13:26.388 --> 08:13:26.398 align:start position:0%
as the atc's have so if someone were to
 
08:13:27.350 --> 08:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
challenge that that would be an
 
08:13:29.110 --> 08:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
interesting to see how that would that
 
08:13:30.788 --> 08:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
would play out
 
08:13:33.830 --> 08:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
in respect to the revenue
 
08:13:35.670 --> 08:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i said this before i'm sure people
 
08:13:37.190 --> 08:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
have heard me say this
 
08:13:38.468 --> 08:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
and we've all probably heard it from
 
08:13:40.628 --> 08:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
other individuals
 
08:13:43.670 --> 08:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
property taxes with the exception of
 
08:13:46.310 --> 08:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
fuel tax right now property taxes is one
 
08:13:47.830 --> 08:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that we hear about the
 
08:13:47.840 --> 08:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that we hear about the
most

08:13:49.350 --> 08:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
most
 
08:13:52.150 --> 08:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
this is a opportunity for not just
 
08:13:53.670 --> 08:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
one caucus of the other this is an
 
08:13:56.868 --> 08:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this body today
 
08:13:58.708 --> 08:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
to actually deliver
 
08:14:00.388 --> 08:14:00.398 align:start position:0%
a reduction
 
08:14:02.388 --> 08:14:02.398 align:start position:0%
in on property taxes throughout the
 
08:14:04.628 --> 08:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
entire state it's not talk it's not a
 
08:14:06.628 --> 08:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
future promise it's not something that
 
08:14:08.150 --> 08:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
we'll put into the bill later it's
 
08:14:11.270 --> 08:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually in the bill it is in there
 
08:14:12.310 --> 08:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
08:14:14.468 --> 08:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
in order to deliver on that we need to
 
08:14:17.110 --> 08:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
on our part we have to push that green
 
08:14:20.070 --> 08:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
button to do this
 
08:14:21.990 --> 08:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
if you are not in if you don't want to
 
08:14:24.070 --> 08:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
support lowering property taxes or if
 
08:14:25.750 --> 08:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
you feel that lowering property taxes
 
08:14:27.670 --> 08:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
for some reason is not fair because some
 
08:14:30.070 --> 08:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
communities or some houses are valued
 
08:14:31.590 --> 08:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
more than other houses
 
08:14:31.600 --> 08:14:32.388 align:start position:0%
more than other houses
well

08:14:32.388 --> 08:14:32.398 align:start position:0%
well
 
08:14:34.628 --> 08:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps you push that red button
 
08:14:36.388 --> 08:14:36.398 align:start position:0%
but if you want to join me and actually
 
08:14:38.468 --> 08:14:38.478 align:start position:0%
deliver in lower property taxes
 
08:14:40.548 --> 08:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire state and not just
 
08:14:43.750 --> 08:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
talk about it join me push that green
 
08:14:45.110 --> 08:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
button and support the committee's
 
08:14:47.430 --> 08:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation about the passes amended
 
08:14:49.350 --> 08:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
 
08:14:49.360 --> 08:14:51.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
questions

08:14:51.190 --> 08:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:14:54.948 --> 08:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
no remember it does not yield
 
08:14:57.510 --> 08:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative palmola
 
08:15:01.270 --> 08:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:03.350 --> 08:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
08:15:05.990 --> 08:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
08:15:09.430 --> 08:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:25.910 --> 08:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:29.270 --> 08:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:32.628 --> 08:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to speak against the pending
 
08:15:35.670 --> 08:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion on house bill 1598
 
08:15:38.150 --> 08:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
08:15:39.990 --> 08:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
i want to begin by
 
08:15:42.308 --> 08:15:42.318 align:start position:0%
agreeing with many who have spoken
 
08:15:46.708 --> 08:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:46.718 --> 08:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
by

08:15:48.070 --> 08:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
08:15:49.990 --> 08:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
saying in different words what they've
 
08:15:52.548 --> 08:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
said decades of experience
 
08:15:53.910 --> 08:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
have proven
 
08:15:55.990 --> 08:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that legal prohibition of
 
08:15:59.110 --> 08:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis fosters a harmful
 
08:16:00.548 --> 08:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
black market
 
08:16:02.708 --> 08:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
and high levels of arrests
 
08:16:04.868 --> 08:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
of marginalized people
 
08:16:07.350 --> 08:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
maine massachusetts and vermont and many
 
08:16:11.030 --> 08:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
other states have moved to legalize
 
08:16:14.230 --> 08:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
with this context and background within
 
08:16:17.110 --> 08:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
common sense regulatory frameworks
 
08:16:19.910 --> 08:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does need to join this
 
08:16:19.920 --> 08:16:20.948 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does need to join this
movement

08:16:20.948 --> 08:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
movement
 
08:16:23.030 --> 08:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
away from prohibition
 
08:16:25.830 --> 08:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
to best practice legalization of the
 
08:16:28.308 --> 08:16:28.318 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale of cannabis for
 
08:16:32.468 --> 08:16:32.478 align:start position:0%
recreational adult use in new hampshire
 
08:16:35.030 --> 08:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately however
 
08:16:37.270 --> 08:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill sets up a legalized
 
08:16:39.510 --> 08:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
legalization structure
 
08:16:42.308 --> 08:16:42.318 align:start position:0%
that is unlikely to work
 
08:16:44.468 --> 08:16:44.478 align:start position:0%
although the amendments just adopted are
 
08:16:44.478 --> 08:16:45.990 align:start position:0%
although the amendments just adopted are
welcome

08:16:45.990 --> 08:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
08:16:46.000 --> 08:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
welcome
the

08:16:47.030 --> 08:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:16:50.070 --> 08:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
i suggest that house bill 1598's
 
08:16:52.948 --> 08:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
fundamental structural defects
 
08:16:54.308 --> 08:16:54.318 align:start position:0%
go deep
 
08:16:56.388 --> 08:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
and cannot be fixed by piecemeal
 
08:16:56.398 --> 08:16:58.230 align:start position:0%
and cannot be fixed by piecemeal
amendment

08:16:58.230 --> 08:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:17:02.150 --> 08:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
the bill's chosen model for legalization
 
08:17:06.070 --> 08:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
is unprecedented in the united states
 
08:17:07.510 --> 08:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
08:17:11.510 --> 08:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
a government-owned retail monopoly

which is officially neutral on this bill
 
08:18:02.070 --> 08:18:02.080 align:start position:0%

08:19:30.868 --> 08:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
appear to me to demonstrate that

flexible vertical marketing integration

supply chain
 
08:19:58.388 --> 08:19:58.398 align:start position:0%
will likely prevent

adopted whatever it was an hour ago or

08:20:23.670 --> 08:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
so

we've gotten over that hurdle and

sponsors
 
08:21:40.308 --> 08:21:40.318 align:start position:0%
suggested that implementation of this
 
08:21:43.350 --> 08:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
model in new hampshire could generate
 
08:21:46.388 --> 08:21:46.398 align:start position:0%
about 250 million dollars annual net
 
08:21:48.788 --> 08:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state

liquor commission testimony before the

ways and means committee
 
08:21:56.468 --> 08:21:56.478 align:start position:0%

states and people in the industry
 
08:22:02.708 --> 08:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
convinced the committee that net annual
 
08:22:05.750 --> 08:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
revenue after full implementation
 
08:22:09.030 --> 08:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
would more likely be about one-tenth of
 
08:22:11.670 --> 08:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
that original estimate
 
08:22:13.388 --> 08:22:13.398 align:start position:0%
considering the exclusion of
 
08:22:16.308 --> 08:22:16.318 align:start position:0%
cannabis-infused food or drink products
 
08:22:18.548 --> 08:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
we now estimate that
 
08:22:20.388 --> 08:22:20.398 align:start position:0%
in the best case
 
08:22:23.030 --> 08:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
net revenues will more likely level off
 
08:22:24.788 --> 08:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
at between 20 million
 
08:22:26.788 --> 08:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
and 30 million dollars
 
08:22:28.868 --> 08:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
at the end of a transition period of at
 
08:22:30.468 --> 08:22:30.478 align:start position:0%
least four years
 
08:22:32.788 --> 08:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
that will be needed for rulemaking

and product and store development
 
08:22:39.830 --> 08:22:39.840 align:start position:0%

de-prioritizes funding for drug misuse

08:23:41.430 --> 08:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me representatives of these
 
08:23:41.440 --> 08:23:42.388 align:start position:0%
excuse me representatives of these
centers

08:23:42.388 --> 08:23:42.398 align:start position:0%
centers
 
08:23:45.190 --> 08:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
did testify to ways and pains that they
 
08:23:46.788 --> 08:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
may not survive
 
08:23:49.590 --> 08:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
if the house bill 1598 model is
 
08:23:49.600 --> 08:23:51.270 align:start position:0%
if the house bill 1598 model is
implemented

08:23:51.270 --> 08:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
08:23:53.270 --> 08:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for these centers has
 
08:23:55.990 --> 08:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
further advised that the amended bill's
 
08:23:57.830 --> 08:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
limited allowance for
 
08:23:57.840 --> 08:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
limited allowance for
for-profit

08:23:59.190 --> 08:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
08:24:01.510 --> 08:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
components of alternative treatment
 
08:24:03.350 --> 08:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
centers will not work
 
08:24:05.670 --> 08:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
in short the amended bill fails to put
 
08:24:08.628 --> 08:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
in place safeguards to ensure survival
 
08:24:09.990 --> 08:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's alternative
 
08:24:12.628 --> 08:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis centers
 
08:24:14.868 --> 08:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i feel that
 
08:24:19.030 --> 08:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
i i believe that house bill 1598 is not
 
08:24:22.628 --> 08:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time it needs more work
 
08:24:24.708 --> 08:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
interim study would be a good option to
 
08:24:26.788 --> 08:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
help move legalization in a better
 
08:24:28.708 --> 08:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
direction and i hope that you will join
 
08:24:31.750 --> 08:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
me in voting against otpa thank you mr
 
08:24:32.948 --> 08:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
speaker does the member yield to
 
08:24:32.958 --> 08:24:35.270 align:start position:0%
speaker does the member yield to
questions

08:24:35.270 --> 08:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
08:24:38.070 --> 08:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
member does not yield
 
08:24:40.230 --> 08:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
08:24:42.548 --> 08:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
08:24:47.270 --> 08:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:48.548 --> 08:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you
 
08:24:50.468 --> 08:24:50.478 align:start position:0%
colleagues i promise i'll keep this
 
08:24:52.070 --> 08:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
really really short
 
08:24:53.510 --> 08:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
the representative from sugar hill was
 
08:24:58.150 --> 08:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
exactly correct the 2022 unh poll says
 
08:25:01.350 --> 08:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
74 of new hampshire residents support
 
08:25:04.308 --> 08:25:04.318 align:start position:0%
legalization that poll went on and said
 
08:25:06.308 --> 08:25:06.318 align:start position:0%
61 percent
 
08:25:10.708 --> 08:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
of that poll supports this bill
 
08:25:12.388 --> 08:25:12.398 align:start position:0%
what does this bill do pretty
 
08:25:14.628 --> 08:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
straightforward legalization is what
 
08:25:16.548 --> 08:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
everybody's looking for this truly not
 
08:25:18.788 --> 08:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
decriminalizes but
 
08:25:22.070 --> 08:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
stops new hampshire from prosecuting
 
08:25:24.388 --> 08:25:24.398 align:start position:0%
and arresting our citizens for
 
08:25:27.430 --> 08:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
possession and use of cannabis
 
08:25:28.868 --> 08:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
what else does the bill do it does set
 
08:25:31.510 --> 08:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
up a state monopoly uh readily admitted
 
08:25:33.030 --> 08:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
it allows the state to be able to sell
 
08:25:34.708 --> 08:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis certain counties products what
 
08:25:37.030 --> 08:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
does that do to revenue no one talked
 
08:25:39.510 --> 08:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
about revenue revenue estimated from and
 
08:25:41.270 --> 08:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very conservative estimate the
 
08:25:43.430 --> 08:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
revenue for gross sales by the new
 
08:25:45.990 --> 08:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire liquor commission was 250
 
08:25:48.308 --> 08:25:48.318 align:start position:0%
million dollars in sales in the state of
 
08:25:50.070 --> 08:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that is a conservative
 
08:25:53.110 --> 08:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
number of that 250 million dollars 50
 
08:25:54.868 --> 08:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
million dollars would be estimated as
 
08:25:57.350 --> 08:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
profit we should be used to run the
 
08:25:59.510 --> 08:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
state stores their first their operating
 
08:25:59.520 --> 08:26:00.548 align:start position:0%
state stores their first their operating
costs

08:26:00.548 --> 08:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
costs
 
08:26:03.830 --> 08:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill allocates 4.6 million dollars
 
08:26:05.590 --> 08:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
to the state liquor stores so they can
 
08:26:07.910 --> 08:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
open up their first three or four stores
 
08:26:09.830 --> 08:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then from those three or four sales
 
08:26:11.350 --> 08:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
stores they'll use their revenue to be
 
08:26:13.110 --> 08:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to open up any future stores that
 
08:26:14.070 --> 08:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
they need
 
08:26:15.910 --> 08:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
it requires the new hampshire liquor
 
08:26:17.590 --> 08:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
commission to pay back the citizens of
 
08:26:20.468 --> 08:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire 4.6 million dollars back
 
08:26:23.510 --> 08:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the general fund within five years so
 
08:26:25.110 --> 08:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer is not on the hook for
 
08:26:27.990 --> 08:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
anything to start this project
 
08:26:29.750 --> 08:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
lastly what does it do to the remaining
 
08:26:32.070 --> 08:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
revenue after operational expenses and
 
08:26:33.350 --> 08:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
paying back
 
08:26:35.670 --> 08:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire the 4.6
 
08:26:39.430 --> 08:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars this bill gives direct
 
08:26:42.468 --> 08:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
tax relief to every property owner in
 
08:26:44.948 --> 08:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
the state 50 percent
 
08:26:48.830 --> 08:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
of all net revenue must go against the
 
08:26:51.670 --> 08:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
363 million dollar swept tax that we ask
 
08:26:53.350 --> 08:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
every citizen to pay
 
08:26:55.510 --> 08:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
it directly goes against that to lower
 
08:26:58.548 --> 08:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
the taxes for every single property
 
08:26:58.558 --> 08:26:59.430 align:start position:0%
the taxes for every single property
owner

08:26:59.430 --> 08:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
owner
 
08:27:00.868 --> 08:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
08:27:02.628 --> 08:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
additionally what else does it do gives
 
08:27:05.830 --> 08:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
30 percent to pay off the new hampshire
 
08:27:07.230 --> 08:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
08:27:10.548 --> 08:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
4.9 billion dollar debt
 
08:27:12.308 --> 08:27:12.318 align:start position:0%
the faster we can pay that debt off the
 
08:27:14.230 --> 08:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
less our citizens are paid in interest
 
08:27:16.308 --> 08:27:16.318 align:start position:0%
and the less our towns in our state and
 
08:27:18.308 --> 08:27:18.318 align:start position:0%
city employees will pay for retirement
 
08:27:20.230 --> 08:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
contributions it automatically will
 
08:27:21.990 --> 08:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
raise their pay if we get this paid off
 
08:27:22.000 --> 08:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
raise their pay if we get this paid off
faster

08:27:23.270 --> 08:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
faster
 
08:27:25.910 --> 08:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
lastly it gives money to the
 
08:27:27.670 --> 08:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
08:27:29.750 --> 08:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
for drug and alcohol cessation programs
 
08:27:31.510 --> 08:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
it gives 10 percent of the revenues or
 
08:27:33.990 --> 08:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars whatever is less so
 
08:27:35.190 --> 08:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
if we get to the point where we're
 
08:27:38.548 --> 08:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
making 300 million dollars in net profit
 
08:27:39.750 --> 08:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
08:27:41.910 --> 08:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
services will get 25 million dollars
 
08:27:44.548 --> 08:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
lastly gives five percent to police
 
08:27:46.548 --> 08:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
officers first responders for training
 
08:27:48.388 --> 08:27:48.398 align:start position:0%
to teach them to become drug recognition
 
08:27:50.150 --> 08:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
experts to deal with the incidents on
 
08:27:52.070 --> 08:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
the job that they'll have to deal with
 
08:27:54.070 --> 08:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we acknowledge there may be some
 
08:27:55.830 --> 08:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that they'll be able to better deal with
 
08:27:57.990 --> 08:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
them and then it gives five percent to
 
08:27:59.670 --> 08:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
children's mental health programs
 
08:28:01.750 --> 08:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
through dhhs
 
08:28:04.708 --> 08:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
so again this is a win across the board
 
08:28:07.030 --> 08:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
for all the citizens of new hampshire
 
08:28:07.040 --> 08:28:08.150 align:start position:0%
for all the citizens of new hampshire
all

08:28:08.150 --> 08:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
all
 
08:28:10.948 --> 08:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
all advocacies are taken care of we gave
 
08:28:13.110 --> 08:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
in this bill the atcs which are
 
08:28:15.670 --> 08:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about lost revenue we gave
 
08:28:17.110 --> 08:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
them the ability because we found out
 
08:28:18.150 --> 08:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire banking
 
08:28:20.388 --> 08:28:20.398 align:start position:0%
association that not-for-profits can own
 
08:28:22.628 --> 08:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
for-profit entities underneath them so
 
08:28:24.468 --> 08:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
we gave them the ability to file for a
 
08:28:26.708 --> 08:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
for-profit entity underneath them and
 
08:28:28.628 --> 08:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
allow them to apply for cultivation
 
08:28:30.468 --> 08:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and transportation
 
08:28:32.628 --> 08:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
licenses from the liquor commission
 
08:28:35.190 --> 08:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
again this is a make hole provision we
 
08:28:36.468 --> 08:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
recognize we'll be in a little bit of
 
08:28:37.830 --> 08:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
direct competition with the medical
 
08:28:39.830 --> 08:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana industry or correction the
 
08:28:41.990 --> 08:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
08:28:42.000 --> 08:28:43.510 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
industry

08:28:43.510 --> 08:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
industry
 
08:28:45.990 --> 08:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we will we made provisions for that
 
08:28:47.750 --> 08:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
to give them an additional revenue
 
08:28:49.670 --> 08:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
stream to help offset any potential
 
08:28:52.868 --> 08:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
losses they may have again this bill was
 
08:28:55.270 --> 08:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
was thoroughly vetted i think i had
 
08:28:57.190 --> 08:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
drafted close to seven different
 
08:28:59.510 --> 08:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendments that were incorporating at
 
08:29:01.750 --> 08:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
least two dozen
 
08:29:04.388 --> 08:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
different uh requests from both sides of
 
08:29:06.788 --> 08:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
the aisle and they were all incorporated
 
08:29:08.948 --> 08:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
into this bill you see the bipartisan
 
08:29:10.308 --> 08:29:10.318 align:start position:0%
nature of this bill when you look at the
 
08:29:12.548 --> 08:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative from dover's and mine
 
08:29:15.030 --> 08:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix the accidental
 
08:29:16.948 --> 08:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
illegalization of the
 
08:29:20.150 --> 08:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the um edibles uh i was ready to do
 
08:29:21.750 --> 08:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
for representative marsha's bill uh
 
08:29:23.190 --> 08:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
08:29:25.270 --> 08:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
pi if needed because again it made the
 
08:29:26.868 --> 08:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
bill better it doesn't matter which side
 
08:29:28.548 --> 08:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
of the aisle the amendment came from if
 
08:29:30.150 --> 08:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
it made the bill better it was
 
08:29:32.468 --> 08:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this bill this bill is
 
08:29:34.070 --> 08:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
a great bipartisan bill and i'd ask you
 
08:29:35.990 --> 08:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
to please vote green
 
08:29:38.230 --> 08:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's remember yield to questions

08:29:53.110 --> 08:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
08:29:56.468 --> 08:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
real question that i i would like asked
 
08:29:58.948 --> 08:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
did anyone consider
 
08:30:03.670 --> 08:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
if the state establishing these centers
 
08:30:06.868 --> 08:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
to sell what is now a federally illegal
 
08:30:06.878 --> 08:30:08.070 align:start position:0%
to sell what is now a federally illegal
drug

08:30:08.070 --> 08:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
drug
 
08:30:10.548 --> 08:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
would put the federal funding that new
 
08:30:12.388 --> 08:30:12.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire gets
 
08:30:15.830 --> 08:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
in many many ways in jeopardy
 
08:30:17.030 --> 08:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question what i would
 
08:30:19.030 --> 08:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
tell you is this is that from the new
 
08:30:20.628 --> 08:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire banking commission we heard
 
08:30:22.468 --> 08:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
that the department of treasury has a
 
08:30:24.788 --> 08:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
department called fincin i think it has
 
08:30:26.708 --> 08:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
to do with financial crimes
 
08:30:29.350 --> 08:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
fincin from the banking industry gave
 
08:30:31.510 --> 08:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
every new hampshire bank directions on
 
08:30:33.510 --> 08:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
how to deal with cannabis related funds
 
08:30:36.230 --> 08:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
which are legal federally so apparently
 
08:30:37.350 --> 08:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government's already kind of
 
08:30:38.388 --> 08:30:38.398 align:start position:0%
made up their mind they're not doing
 
08:30:40.150 --> 08:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
anything with this with these bills with
 
08:30:43.750 --> 08:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
with the states so um and so i guess the
 
08:30:45.030 --> 08:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is every
 
08:30:46.548 --> 08:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
indicator from the federal government is
 
08:30:48.308 --> 08:30:48.318 align:start position:0%
that they are not going to prosecute or
 
08:30:50.230 --> 08:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
come after the state any state that has
 
08:30:52.150 --> 08:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
legalization at this point this member
 
08:30:56.468 --> 08:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:58.868 --> 08:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you
 
08:31:00.150 --> 08:31:00.160 align:start position:0%

08:31:00.160 --> 08:31:02.150 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i'll be very
quick

08:31:02.150 --> 08:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
quick
 
08:31:05.830 --> 08:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
if we make laws in this body and we feel
 
08:31:07.910 --> 08:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that those laws need to be changed like
 
08:31:09.750 --> 08:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
edibles need to be added in a year or
 
08:31:12.468 --> 08:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
two or other provisions that we may need
 
08:31:15.270 --> 08:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
to oversee to improve the law that we
 
08:31:18.230 --> 08:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
created would we be able to do that
 
08:31:20.628 --> 08:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you sarah
 
08:31:25.670 --> 08:31:25.680 align:start position:0%

and the refusal to sell recreational
 
08:33:35.670 --> 08:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
edibles required by this bill
 
08:33:40.708 --> 08:33:40.718 align:start position:0%

08:34:25.430 --> 08:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
monopoly model this year will make it
 
08:34:28.230 --> 08:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
much harder to replace with one that
 
08:34:31.830 --> 08:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
works next year even if we could get the
 
08:34:33.990 --> 08:34:34.000 align:start position:0%

on new hampshire counties and towns

testified that many small towns in new
 
08:39:32.798 --> 08:39:33.910 align:start position:0%
testified that many small towns in new
hampshire

08:39:33.910 --> 08:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
08:39:37.350 --> 08:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
will need to purchase equipment
 
08:39:38.948 --> 08:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire county attorneys
 
08:39:41.190 --> 08:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
testified they will need to purchase
 
08:39:43.990 --> 08:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
additional equipment and hire additional
 
08:39:48.230 --> 08:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:39:50.070 --> 08:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
since the state of new hampshire is not
 
08:39:52.788 --> 08:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
funding these additional costs
 
08:39:54.388 --> 08:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
it is my position
 
08:39:56.468 --> 08:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
that this downshifting of cost to the
 
08:39:58.230 --> 08:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
towns and counties
 
08:40:00.868 --> 08:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
is a violation of article 28a of the new
 
08:40:02.868 --> 08:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
08:40:04.948 --> 08:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
and that is that is why i cannot support
 
08:40:09.430 --> 08:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:12.230 --> 08:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
i tried to make that point in the past
 
08:40:13.750 --> 08:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i failed
 
08:40:15.910 --> 08:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i do appreciate the opportunity to
 
08:40:15.920 --> 08:40:16.708 align:start position:0%
and i do appreciate the opportunity to
fail

08:40:16.708 --> 08:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
fail
 
08:40:19.750 --> 08:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:22.070 --> 08:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution says thou
 
08:40:24.788 --> 08:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
shalt not downshift
 
08:40:26.150 --> 08:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
08:40:28.308 --> 08:40:28.318 align:start position:0%
try not to downshift unless you think
 
08:40:31.670 --> 08:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's for a really good idea
 
08:40:34.150 --> 08:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
in closing please allow me to quote from
 
08:40:37.670 --> 08:40:37.680 align:start position:0%

thank you mr

thank you mr

08:41:10.708 --> 08:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
08:41:14.230 --> 08:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
was looked at by finance
 
08:41:16.788 --> 08:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
and we had some concerns
 
08:41:20.230 --> 08:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we might be passing some costs on
 
08:41:23.030 --> 08:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
as the bill came to us
 
08:41:26.150 --> 08:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
it had severe restrictions
 
08:41:30.708 --> 08:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
on what was an exception to the bill
 
08:41:34.788 --> 08:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
finance addressed those restrictions
 
08:41:38.308 --> 08:41:38.318 align:start position:0%
they removed financial impact
 
08:41:40.308 --> 08:41:40.318 align:start position:0%
as a restriction
 
08:41:43.430 --> 08:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
and allowed it as a restriction
 
08:41:46.150 --> 08:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
and they removed it as a pro
 
08:41:48.628 --> 08:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited and they allowed it as a
 
08:41:48.638 --> 08:41:51.270 align:start position:0%
prohibited and they allowed it as a
restriction

08:41:51.270 --> 08:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
08:41:54.788 --> 08:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
we considered those small towns
 
08:41:54.798 --> 08:41:56.308 align:start position:0%
we considered those small towns
and

08:41:56.308 --> 08:41:56.318 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:41:58.548 --> 08:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
we also
 
08:42:00.628 --> 08:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
worried about whether they had the
 
08:42:00.638 --> 08:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
worried about whether they had the
equipment

08:42:02.230 --> 08:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
08:42:04.468 --> 08:42:04.478 align:start position:0%
and the costs that it would be for them
 
08:42:05.910 --> 08:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
08:42:08.788 --> 08:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
and therefore we basically created a
 
08:42:08.798 --> 08:42:09.910 align:start position:0%
and therefore we basically created a
bill

08:42:09.910 --> 08:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
08:42:11.990 --> 08:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
with exceptions that i think you can
 
08:42:16.388 --> 08:42:16.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:19.270 --> 08:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any
 
08:42:23.030 --> 08:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
town that will be impacted by this bill
 
08:42:26.030 --> 08:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mandate that you do
 
08:42:29.510 --> 08:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
interrogations it says if you do
 
08:42:29.520 --> 08:42:31.590 align:start position:0%
interrogations it says if you do
interrogations

08:42:31.590 --> 08:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
interrogations
 
08:42:32.948 --> 08:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
they need to be
 
08:42:35.990 --> 08:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
recorded electronically
 
08:42:39.190 --> 08:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say video recordings
 
08:42:41.750 --> 08:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
it just says they needed
 
08:42:43.708 --> 08:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
to be recorded
 
08:42:43.718 --> 08:42:45.430 align:start position:0%
to be recorded
electronically

08:42:45.430 --> 08:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
08:42:49.190 --> 08:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and there is exception in the bill
 
08:42:50.788 --> 08:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
08:42:54.308 --> 08:42:54.318 align:start position:0%
exceptions for many many causes
 
08:42:56.708 --> 08:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
including financial
 
08:42:59.670 --> 08:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
causes or lack of equipment
 
08:43:02.948 --> 08:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
so i believe that this is a good bill
 
08:43:02.958 --> 08:43:03.670 align:start position:0%
so i believe that this is a good bill
it

08:43:03.670 --> 08:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:43:06.388 --> 08:43:06.398 align:start position:0%
brings transparency
 
08:43:09.430 --> 08:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the interrogation process
 
08:43:13.430 --> 08:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
it protects the person in custody
 
08:43:16.070 --> 08:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
it protects the police
 
08:43:19.590 --> 08:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
it is overall a very good bill most of
 
08:43:22.468 --> 08:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
our large cities are already doing
 
08:43:24.868 --> 08:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
what this bill is asking
 
08:43:26.868 --> 08:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
