00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
and uh call this a quorum
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
and um there's uh money is
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford and this is
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
and so we're here for uh HB uh 618 which
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
is relative to wage garnishment which
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'll support uh payments
 
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.290 align:start position:0%
I'll support uh payments
um

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone that wants to speak to
 
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone that wants to speak to
this

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh bill at this time okay
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh the niche you and I okay
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you had a chance to
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
look at it very much it it does break it
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
breaks down into really two sections
 
00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
um your first section
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
which to move from your two months which
 
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
is now one month
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
in order to uh be in a rear edge
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
would uh trip some federal is that what
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
they is that what we had said at the
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
last committee meeting in March because
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that well are we
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
personally the system is one month oh I
 
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
see it now for in a rearage uh the bill
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
asked to go with two months
 
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay well no I wouldn't have I don't
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
think I'd have an issue with it however
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
it does trip these Federal issues which
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
a researchers
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay so let's title 4D
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Security Act of 75. so I just want to
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
take some notes So So currently
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.469 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
would go to two months
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
but then there's possible that it could
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
interfere with federal law yes
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
and we can't do that
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
well we can however it if you look at
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
the analysis on the back page it'll trip
 
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
all these
 
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.670 align:start position:0%
all these
um

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
possibility of losing Federal funding
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
of 13.6 million in federal funds and
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
then 1.2 million dollars incentive funds
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
and 1.9 million of TANF law Grant
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
twelding so those would go to the
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in a rearage
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
no this is B to the state this is the
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
funding I actually could be reduced Okay
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
the reason I know this because I dealt
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
with wage assignment in the past and
 
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
they brought in it and we didn't like
 
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 align:start position:0%
the new laws they were coming forward
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
because it was mandatory
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
and they came up from Boston and said uh
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
you do this we're taking 21 million from
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
you now I I think it was 20 months the
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
whole but what does the state do with
 
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
run their operations
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to do that well why
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't you child support uh system is
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
funded two-thirds by the federal
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
government okay and you know and New
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire puts in the third
 
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire puts in the third
one

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
oh yeah she emailed us this
 
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
oh yeah she emailed us this
um

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
if this is going to the state
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
but it's blocked because we changed this
 
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
what is the state doing with this money
 
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:13.940 align:start position:0%
that we would no longer be able to do
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't get this money
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I think you'll find there
 
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.249 align:start position:0%
um I think you'll find there
um

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
their Computing systems depend on this
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
money I believe
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.209 align:start position:0%
as well as
um

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.250 align:start position:0%
um
enforcement

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
um probably their attorneys some of it
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
but they would they the the federal
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
government has the right to reduce what
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
they give them because they're out of
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
compliance now with federal law sure if
 
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
we go to two months right so then that
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
makes me think that we shouldn't do that
 
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.810 align:start position:0%
makes me think that we shouldn't do that
okay

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
what do you think I agree with you at
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
this point anyway so we're gonna
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I have my philosophies today
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this is the time or
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
place to do it sure in there power ever
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
moving to the second part which is here
 
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
moving to the second part which is here
okay

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
in number uh paragraph three
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh they're talking about creating a
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
standard form
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
um to Enlighten people about what they
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
can do because we have it in the law
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
but apparently people aren't being told
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
this is the law
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
and not everybody has an attorney I
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
recall that from from March okay yeah
 
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.150 align:start position:0%
recall that from from March okay yeah
which

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me that does sound good
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
so and that's why we retained this was
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to I I recall this now
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
um because we wanted to change a little
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
this so we want to keep this as the one
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
month but we want to keep this part
 
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of things we have done that in the
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
past we've told them to Enlighten the
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
public as they come in and right so I
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
was surprised to find that this didn't
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
happen yeah so can we get them isn't
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
that a process that they can draft that
 
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.730 align:start position:0%
that a process that they can draft that
now

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
um to change this part too yeah we could
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
just have them
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
leave it leave it as is right this would
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
be a new paragraph added that would be
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
an amended one here I believe so is does
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
that come to You Christina are you the
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
one that drafts this to no okay do you
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
have to take it down let's go downstairs
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
and we'd bring back a uh an amendment an
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
amendment okay or can we email it to
 
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.930 align:start position:0%
amendment okay or can we email it to
them

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:50.210 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
okay so what we want to do we just want
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation to the club uh
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
sure other members right and that's fine
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
um because we can do that at the
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
executive section so what we want to do
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
we want to remove
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
section two about
 
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.530 align:start position:0%
section two about
income

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.470 align:start position:0%
income
assignment

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to but we want keep three
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
yeah they'll have to make a little
 
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
changes because this is we don't want to
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
say final divorce because it's not it's
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
not about divorce it's about
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
children sure
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
um right and not and not every situation
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
is a divorce it's just a child support
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
right exactly so I put down bio before
 
00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:38.569 align:start position:0%
right exactly so I put down bio before
final

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
or the that's it could be final I guess
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:48.740 align:start position:0%
um change right yeah
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
during the process and I I am not sure
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
where the process begins now
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
for child support they have referees Now
 
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
for child support they have referees Now
help

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
to buy them before hearing
 
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
to buy them before hearing
okay

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
um but this part everything else was
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
good here if they just if they take all
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
this out then this is all right number
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
one a would probably say but they would
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
they'll know what to do they should just
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
because this is the notification
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
shall notify each party of their income
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
assignment wages right for child support
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
will be automatic under the RSA unless
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
both parties come to an agreement other
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
another category down here income
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
assignment yeah the Department of Health
 
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
assignment yeah the Department of Health
change

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
Support Services shall develop a
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
standard form right that's kind of
 
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
standard form right that's kind of
interesting

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
how they did that she does 1A
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
do we want this to change to be instead
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Bureau of
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think it's I think that
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
is correct because they come on to
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oh okay I
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
think the vision is okay I don't I don't
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
so let me let me just write the question
 
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
so let me let me just write the question
if

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
where's that here
 
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
where's that here
three

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:27.980 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
um and then and then that's it right
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's then oh what was it what did we
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
want down here
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
um well it's interesting because when
 
00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:44.339 align:start position:0%
you that's me really this amendment
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
conflicts with Federal 45 uh the one
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
that we talked about 100 what could we
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
have right which is up here and number
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
two that we're eliminating which states
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
that the income of the non-custodial
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't become which is this is
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
what flagged us to need to put into
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
something it demonstrates what happened
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the past it hasn't been corrected for
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
environment at the federal level yes
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
because they're still calling people
 
00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:11.459 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents right and we don't
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
do that anymore right a person that pays
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
non-custodial oh yeah which I always
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great offense to because it means
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
in a sense you're not really apparent
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and it and it has someone has to
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
pay so yeah but well both people should
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
see the child so yeah and we've come a
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
long way if a lot of people don't think
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
so but we really have in
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
this whole methodology part though this
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
is this part all in the this isn't in
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
the uh right but it doesn't go into the
 
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.730 align:start position:0%
the uh right but it doesn't go into the
RSA

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
no right okay this is just for our
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
right unless you're okay so I can send
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
and I'll send you
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll
 
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:09.500 align:start position:0%
Cc or to it um so OLS
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:18.620 align:start position:0%
and then house bill
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to do exactly what we
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
divorce

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.689 align:start position:0%
 
section

00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
10 entirely
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
and then three i a
 
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
and then three i a
change

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
at the final divorce
 
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.269 align:start position:0%
at the final divorce
hearing

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.650 align:start position:0%
hearing
two

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
i n b four
 
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.569 align:start position:0%
i n b four
here

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
all right okay let's see who would
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
please make the following change
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
you wanna okay
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
yep uh remove section
 
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.689 align:start position:0%
yep uh remove section
two

00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:37.699 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay happens three or one three one a
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
we wanted to change
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
the name it you know just a consistency
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
section two remove three a change
 
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.890 align:start position:0%
section two remove three a change
right

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
calmer after the three
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
is it well it's three and then it goes
 
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.340 align:start position:0%
down yeah all right yeah so three eyes
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
I don't know we can always check with
 
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.250 align:start position:0%
I don't know we can always check with
them

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah you've captured it is that all of
 
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.890 align:start position:0%
yeah you've captured it is that all of
it

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
well I put down standard form because I
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
don't know why it needs
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
if it's just a form you know it doesn't
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
need do we need a tone that needs to be
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
standard I think I think so but okay I
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
think just standard form meaning goes to
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
everybody why don't you can you uh CC
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
Matt Hayes you have this uh address
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
over at child support
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I only have who comes
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
up in the
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
in your email thing right Christine
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
would know you want me get it from her
 
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.270 align:start position:0%
would know you want me get it from her
sure

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
she'll come back she will yeah you're
 
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.430 align:start position:0%
she'll come back she will yeah you're
confident

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
confident
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
she always does she just gonna show up
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
too I know you should late though so
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
that could be most anytime right right
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hayes is who
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
he's the uh the child support attorney
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
that comes here that's been assigned to
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
the legislature got it well there's also
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh Susan uh person
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
who he works for and then of course is
 
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.130 align:start position:0%
who he works for and then of course is
the

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
I think a woman that runs the whole
 
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.430 align:start position:0%
I think a woman that runs the whole
thing

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
but we yes ordinarily would use Matt
 
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.169 align:start position:0%
but we yes ordinarily would use Matt
Hayes

00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
yep oh I'm sorry
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
sure no problem so because the the
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
current bill you need to see the bill or
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
you got in front of it now okay good
 
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay so the way the current bill is
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
written it conflicts with federal law
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
and it would deny and that's what he was
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
explaining to me in the beginning that
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
um that there would be a conflict with
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
with federal law and that would
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
um prohibit some State funds from coming
 
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
um prohibit some State funds from coming
in

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
so uh so what we wanted to do and this
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
is the whole reason why we retained it
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
in committee was because we wanted to
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
fix these little issues
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
um so what we want to do is remove
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
section two entirely
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
because switching it from it's currently
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
one month if we switch it to two months
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's when we start this conflict with
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.409 align:start position:0%
federal law
um

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
for Section 1A so I'm a little out of
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
order but
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
um it's just a wording issue where we
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
just want to fix the language
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
um no no I'm I'm up here oh you still
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
are up there yeah so one one a I'm sorry
 
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.289 align:start position:0%
are up there yeah so one one a I'm sorry
um

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
we just want to just take out the word
 
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
divorce in divorce hearing because not
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
every child support hearing goes in line
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
with a divorce like it it could and it
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
frequently does but there can also be
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
like engaged couples that break up or
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
boyfriend girlfriends that that break up
 
00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
boyfriend girlfriends that that break up
um

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then down in three one a again it's
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
more just a language thing
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
for the same rationale as one one a
 
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
for the same rationale as one one a
uh

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
we don't want it to say final divorce
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
hearing we wanted to say by and before
 
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.650 align:start position:0%
hearing we wanted to say by and before
hearing

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
just because it might not be a divorce
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
situation and we don't want there to be
 
00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:19.730 align:start position:0%
situation and we don't want there to be
um

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.409 align:start position:0%
um
confusion

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
as to you know if there if someone was
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
in like a boyfriend girlfriend and they
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
need to and they need to get child
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
support we don't want them to be like oh
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
they don't fit under this law because
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's not divorced so we just want to
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
clean up a little bit of language but
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's about
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
creating a form
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
to inform
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
people of this situation under under
 
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.750 align:start position:0%
people of this situation under under
this

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
weird assignment and so that's why
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
instead of just instead of just voting
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
the bill down last uh spring we decided
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
to retain it because these were just a
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
few like minor little issues so
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah of course so but the process I
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
guess is that we have to get OLS to
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
amend it and then present the new
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
Amendment yeah
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
um but but that was what we were going
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
to decide to do
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and then what do we need Christina
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
for she's back
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh Christina do you have an email
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
address for Matt Hayes and we'll send it
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
over to Child Support
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
um through him because he's the one to
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
sign for this committee
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
do you know who I don't have his I don't
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
we want to send him what our intent I'm
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you have his email
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
address so I could send it to him
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
because we're going to send this to OLS
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
the changes we want and then with the
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
same time we'll send it to
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
the way we keep everybody in hope that
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is why I bring my computer to these
 
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.510 align:start position:0%
this is why I bring my computer to these
so

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
and then once I get the email from her
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
with his email address then I can send
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
this to OLS we can have it drafted and
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
we'll have it ready to go to present for
 
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.350 align:start position:0%
we'll have it ready to go to present for
um

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
to present for executive session that's
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
essentially it
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
um did anybody have any feedback
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
do you have any feedback
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any other recommendations
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
who okay
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
we need to fill out our form yep that's
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:40.909 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
we're not doing anything yeah we're
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
going to do a
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
um adoption of amendment
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:55.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
so I sent that all right
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:06.059 align:start position:0%
my language
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
in sections
 
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
again because it's sent it's that's not
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
in a draft anymore
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
because I sent it oh you did oh yeah
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
I have a setting on that it delays my
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
scent items for like 10 seconds so that
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
so that if I have like oh I wanted to
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
add something I could just undo it and
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
then add that last like thought that
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
comes in after geez I may want it yeah
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually not it's a good
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
feature to have
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
so that I can undo things I only have
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
like 10 seconds to do it but if if one
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
more thing then I don't have to send
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
multiple emails I better do about five
 
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.169 align:start position:0%
multiple emails I better do about five
minutes

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
changes to languages in sections one and
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
three and then remove
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have a motion to that this will be
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
ought to passed once amended yeah okay
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
so moved by representative Moulton
 
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:12.980 align:start position:0%
second did by representative big fur
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
Okay and then we will
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
adopt emotion
 
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
to be adopted
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
at exec session
 
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.289 align:start position:0%
at exec session
later

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
good yeah we'll just take a vote uh you
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
know me uh make the motion to amend it
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
as as you wrote it
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
which is in your I didn't get an email
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
now right right but we have to get the
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
amendment back so that I can put the
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's currently being amended well you
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
already said we did a motion well we
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
kind of did yeah that's why I just think
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:25.130 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the amendment
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
number yet so we can't adopt an
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
amendment that we don't have then let me
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
speak to what uh just say what you think
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
pass it that uh we're going to ought to
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
pass it we're going to make a motion to
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment once we get
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment back but we are sending
 
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:51.500 align:start position:0%
and the amendment will remove
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
section two and we're changing language
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
to sections one and three that I read
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
out loud
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
I will second that okay perfect all in
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
favor all in favor aye
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:08.029 align:start position:0%
there we go
um

00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairman I guess that's you
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
did you get her did she get you that one
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
from that age she did oh okay yeah yeah
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
cannot recommend I mean you could put it
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
in an amendment if you want well we're
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
just filling this out you can't make a
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
formal recommendation you can't oh okay
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
you can't do that because you don't have
 
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.149 align:start position:0%
you can't do that because you don't have
four

00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
we do have a corner we've got two out of
 
00:28:33.419 --> 00:28:34.190 align:start position:0%
we do have a corner we've got two out of
three

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh you've technically have four because
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative discipline is on the city
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
oh she is I believe she was she was
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be taken off
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
oh no so unfortunately you do not
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
perform that does not mean that you
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
could meet at any time between now and
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
the exact session even if it's half an
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
hour before okay uh but you can't make
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
it official uh recommendation
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
okay well I just in that case I'm going
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
to forward this to so D Simone you could
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
still uh
 
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.590 align:start position:0%
still uh
um

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
but she couldn't reply to you because
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
um that's a it depends on if you're
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
reporting to everyone so I'm not I'm
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
just sending it to those two
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
we still need you
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
yes you can still make the amendment but
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
hold on to it
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
wait executive session
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah you can meet half an hour
 
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:34.940 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
we made this out does that mean we
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
should not make it out
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's okay but you can't you
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
cannot recommend OTP okay because you
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
can't make you do all that stuff no
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
decision you can keep it hang on to it
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
oh really but we don't turn it into you
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
well you can't because you don't have a
 
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:54.260 align:start position:0%
porn you can't make that recommendation
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay we thought we had a quorum because
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
we did we thought that D Simone was
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
taken off so we thought we had two out
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
bit of time so you could do it anytime
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
between now and before the executive
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
session to make that whole
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation but feel free to get your
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment please
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
what you mean to have another meeting or
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
like a mini meeting I guess but that's
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
why I'm emailing it to them so they can
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
at least read it and review it yep
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's far language that's good
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
okay we've done iPad so as long as as
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
long as you are not communicating via
 
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.370 align:start position:0%
long as you are not communicating via
email

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
you can certainly
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can't reply to a four monthly sure
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
so if it's all four of you that's not
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay but this is not public interest
 
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's complicated so it's like I just
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
want to communicate with people who
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
aren't here so no I only emailed it to
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%

number of mental health providers and

doctors because they were concerned
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
about two things one was that it
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
introduces a new standard for abusive
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
neglect reporting that's inconsistent uh
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
with HIPAA right now state law says a
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
reason to suspect abuser neglect uh you

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
their do their stuff and HIPAA the
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
health information Privacy Act says if
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
you have a reasonable belief that
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
there's abuser neglect that's when you
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
either contact dcyf and or consider
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would be appropriate
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
to release records and then this bill
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
will change that language to clear and
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
convincing and I just can't get behind
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
making that change because I don't see
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
how that's in the best interest of kids
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
so that's where I'm at
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay how about you uh representative
 
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.450 align:start position:0%
okay how about you uh representative
Nelson

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I am in support of
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
the bill but I'm willing to
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
um discuss some sort of compromise
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
um if if we are amenable to that I uh do
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
you feel that it's important for parents
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to have access to medical
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
records with certain exceptions because
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility for the
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
well-being of their child I know that
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
there was some concern and some
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
discussion in the Senate hearing about
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
access to Patient portals
 
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
and being able to refill unnecessary
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
prescriptions and have information that
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for making important
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
Health Care decisions that minor might
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
not be prepared to make
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and and that's that's pretty much it
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much so
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
all right so I've spent a lot of time
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
recently taking a look at this bill in
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
great detail and doing some research and
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
I have seen that this bill has come up a
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
number of times uh last year we had a
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
house bill back in 2022 we had House
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 1345 which was essentially uh the
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
same as the Senate bill before us and
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
that was uh interim studied uh in the
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
Senate this year we have a very similar
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 406 that is over in
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services it's nearly
 
00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:02.540 align:start position:0%
identical to the bill that we have here
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
that too has been retained the bill
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
before us has been retained there has
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
not been a clear consensus with these
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
three bills in the last two years that
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
convinces me that this is something that
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
really is uh we should be moving forward
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
with to be honest I'm not even sure why
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
we need this bill in the first place
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
there was a question that was asked of
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsor uh the question was uh
 
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
why do we need this the sponsor Senator
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
Innis said simply it's a statement that
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
reinforces and reinfirms what already
 
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.890 align:start position:0%
reinforces and reinfirms what already
exists

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
so that in and of itself tells me that
 
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
all of the protections that parents need
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
to have do in fact exist and of course
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
HIPAA is the overriding factor which um
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
decisions are made regarding
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality looking back at the
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
house bill 406 representative uh Cole
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
fault simply said that there's nothing
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire statute that
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
specifically asserts a parent's rights
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
to access and that's true we don't
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
because once again HIPAA uh oversees
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
everything he cited very specific
 
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:18.500 align:start position:0%
instances where Health Care Providers
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
cannot under HIPAA release certain
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
information so that in and of itself
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
tells me that every protection that
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
parents need to have in fact exists and
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
so the bills that have come before us
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill here the house bill and of
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
course the bill from two years ago are
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
all moot
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
but all of that being said
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
we still have the house bill 406 I
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
reached out to members of Health and
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services I sent an email to the
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee did not get a response I
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually made a phone call last evening
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
to two members and spoke to them
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
directly and they said they do not know
 
00:54:01.089 --> 00:54:01.099 align:start position:0%
yet when that bill will come up to their
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and so I think we can see
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
what they have to recommend and so at
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
this moment I have to be honest and say
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry I voted to retain this
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill but right now I am looking at itl
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
so we would go forward then we have
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
three out of four members and so our
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is going to be to itl
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh without objection I say
 
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
we move forward with that and close uh
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
we all in favor
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
do we need to take a
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
quick okay we just go forward uh an
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
official vote will be fine okay so I uh
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
would you like to make a motion uh sure
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'll move that we recommend itl I just
 
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that representative
 
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that representative
Nelson's

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
is recorded thank you very much for that
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
okay so I will second that and we will
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
take we'll take a vote
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess no no go right ahead if you
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
would like to speak I just wasn't sure
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
we're gonna vote yeah no I think that
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate since we've made the
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation to itl but uh
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond is correct that
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
all positions should be reflected in
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
that vote
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Raymond uh yes I
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
vote Yes to itl representative Nelson no
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
and and I will vote uh yeah so that the
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
vote will be two to one itl is our
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation okay thank you very much
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
folks all right that was short and sweet
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to call the
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%

FN

and uh previously to our
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the information on the bill
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
and we had some data provided to us
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
through the great work of our
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
Christina Dyer and uh was sent to all
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
members for us to be prepared to
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
address what our intent would be in
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
terms of recommendation for action or
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise on 535
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
so that being said I'll open open the
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%

the table and you'll be recognized
immediately

01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%

so that being said and take advantage of
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
everyone's time uh do we have some
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
comments from our members
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we could all agree that
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
there are
um

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
that attorneys in some of these
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
proceedings are necessary
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
um you know and that would be my
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
interest at least uh closing out this
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
term uh is to get a consensus with
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
both parties uh that that's absolutely a
 
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.570 align:start position:0%
both parties uh that that's absolutely a
necessity

01:34:58.570 --> 01:34:58.580 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
and looking uh you know I'd be looking
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
to Define uh in a small
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
in a small way uh whom we could first
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
um get attorneys uh require attorneys to
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
get appointed to
 
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.890 align:start position:0%
get appointed to
um

01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know then has the terms go on we
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
could redefine or add more I mean of
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
course this is a fiscal note added to it
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we're coming up with the policy if
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
the policy is too grandiose uh the
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee may not
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know may not be on board with us
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
um and that would be a on you know that
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh too bad because we you know the
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
policy is the policy so uh that you know
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking for uh
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.219 --> 01:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
in all proceedings of judicial branch
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
Family Division A minor child who was
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
subject to such perceiving shall be
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
entitled to representation so I I I am
 
01:36:07.689 --> 01:36:07.699 align:start position:0%
not in agreement with that
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
my agreement would be with respect to
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
the uh family Family Court division
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
um for abuse and neglect uh children
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
only would be the first recommendation
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
any other any initial comments from from
 
01:36:31.199 --> 01:36:32.990 align:start position:0%
any other any initial comments from from
members

01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
well I'll just add one thing if I may is
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
and just in reading the bill
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
find myself seeing where the word May
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
and shall uh are present
 
01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.110 align:start position:0%
and shall uh are present
and

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
specific to uh
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
to abuse and abuse
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
or neglect
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
is where the shell comes in but
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
when that's not there it has it has the
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
May and that and I mean for me that's an
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
inherent contradiction
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of um the uh well Mike from
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
a holistic approach to the
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
case being the whole case being heard in
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
court and for the appropriate uh
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
decisions to be made so that all
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
information has been presented at the
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
same or at the same hearing at the same
 
01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
same or at the same hearing at the same
time

01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
so and then the concern here was would
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
is this when there was
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
parents coming without representation
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
for themselves and then de facto for
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
that for the child
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
and this could open up a tremendous I
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
mean a very large
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
would it not open up a very large cost
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
item that we would need to fund
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
for this because as parents coming just
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
heard in previous testimony they're on
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
their own when they come to the cases in
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
some cases and children and family law
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
but that's what my concern my uh my when
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
I say concerned this may and shell that
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that should be
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
these this should be split up in in this
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
case in in what we're talking about here
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:22.139 align:start position:0%
of ghostman
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
um so one thing to consider is we're not
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal here we're policy
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
um and to make sure that we're focused
 
01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
on the policy piece
 
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:34.970 align:start position:0%
on the policy piece
um

01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
but also to include
 
01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.229 align:start position:0%
but also to include
um

01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
representation for children that may be
 
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.629 align:start position:0%
representation for children that may be
placed

01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:45.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
at a group home or out out of in an
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
outside facility
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
um that they are entitled as well to
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
legal counsel if I mean that's in a
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
neglect or abuse case but
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
that they should have access
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
if there's a contingency of them being
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
placed outside of into a group home or a
 
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
would that would that be before the fact
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
or uh meaning before a court case that
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
there that the child would already be
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
in residency as a group home
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
or that would be a determination of the
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
I think if it's determination if they're
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
going to be going versus I mean
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
so that they have
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
um representation once they are in there
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
I mean currently right now we have
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
kids that are not being represented but
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
going forward if we have this they would
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
have representation if there were issues
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
any any further comments on
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
what Grossman had to say
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative so just a clarification
 
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.169 align:start position:0%
representative so just a clarification
so

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh for abuse and neglected cases uh you
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
would you would want to Shell for
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
um any child that has the potential of
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
that would be adding additional language
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
would not uh specifically or where would
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
that would be changing online five at
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
the court shell appointed attorney to
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
represent yourself the child
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh any recommendation of the guardian of
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
lineup yeah that would that would have
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.129 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
yeah actually uh if if uh either Casa or
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
the child law the uh children's Law
 
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.450 align:start position:0%
the child law the uh children's Law
Center

01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
Center
 
01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.770 align:start position:0%
Center
um

01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's Jim and I don't know if they could
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
come up and
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
give us their recommendations
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and if you would just characterize
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
that question one more time
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
so they can specifically answer it
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh so with I'll spell 535 language so
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
we're looking to change this
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
lines three to five uh the May appoint
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
an attorney representing interest of a
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
child but that's just uh involving all
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
neglected and abuse children under the
 
01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
chapter so
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
um representative Grossman uh
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
was looking any child any abuse of
 
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:03.860 align:start position:0%
neglected case
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that has the potential or actual outside
 
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.229 align:start position:0%
that has the potential or actual outside
placement

01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
placement
 
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's it'll be a shell for uh attorney
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
representation right
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm Marcia sink I am the CEO of Casa
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and Caroline Delaney

host City with me is one of our staff
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at Casa so thank you for the
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
um

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
that piece of a child who is in
 
01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:38.780 align:start position:0%
placement out out of state
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was additional language that was
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
possible that was proposed that would
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
expand that in a way that we feel we
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
would not support and that is that a
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
child at risk of placement we currently
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
have about
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
well in any given Year we're serving
 
01:43:00.609 --> 01:43:00.619 align:start position:0%
about 1600 children
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
who are in our abuse and neglect court
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
system and
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
um every you know so many of those
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
children are at risk of placement in and
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
out of state facility so it would open
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
up a very broad opportunity for that
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
appointment we are really supporting a
 
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
slight change to our current Statute in
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
169 C
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
which would allow broader appointment
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
for Council we agree that there there
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
are certain cases where absolutely our
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
our children and youth need an attorney
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
appointed and typically for very
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
specific or unique purposes
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
um educational severe educational
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
neglect cases Refugee and immigrant
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
cases where we need expertise from
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys on those types of cases are
 
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
residential out of state placements also
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
we feel that those kids that were
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
brought to light recently by the office
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate but we so we would
 
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
like to go back to the current statute
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
what we would suggest is going back to
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
the current statute providing a slight
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment which would say
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
specifically that at any point during
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
the proceedings any party to the case
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
could request the appointment of council
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
for a child and it would be at the
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court to make that
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
appointment and it's it's a change in
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
that that it currently only allows the
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem who may be who the
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
child's best wishes may be in conflict
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
with are their best interests may be in
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
conflict with what the child wants and
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's only at that dispositional phase of
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
the proceedings all the child you know
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
the whole process for our for our kids
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
is that's the only opportunity for that
 
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
appointment what we're suggesting is
 
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
that we open up that opportunity that
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
again that any party could request
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
an attorney at any point during any one
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
of the proceedings so it could be after
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
the dispositional hearing when a child
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
is placed in a facility where we think
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
they need a attorney representation or
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
or any party on the case could make that
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify yeah currently the
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
gal can request counsel and that's right
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
now the only component we have had other
 
01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:38.900 align:start position:0%
parties make that request and depending
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances is it the
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion it is at the Court's
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
discretion correct and some of our
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
judges in fact when we have requested an
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
attorney after the dispositional hearing
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
have said
 
01:45:58.570 --> 01:45:58.580 align:start position:0%
we need one but the the statute current
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
currently reads that you've sort of
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
missed that window of opportunity so
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
this would allow the court to make that
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
determination at any point in the
 
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:15.229 align:start position:0%
determination at any point in the
proceedings

01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
we also feel I mean just to sort of add
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the resources that we have in the
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
state are so limited and I know that
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
there is sort of a larger push to have
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
more appointment their mandatory
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
appointments for our kids and the
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
potential cost of that and the resources
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
that we would use
 
01:46:40.570 --> 01:46:40.580 align:start position:0%
um we just think could be used for
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed trauma-informed
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
therapists for our kids or other
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
services that families can access to you
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
know potentially
 
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:50.750 align:start position:0%
know potentially
um

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
help rectify the situation that is at
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
hand and I our kids are so trauma
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
um damaged and there's so many
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
um as we all know lack of resources to
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
provide to them right now we'd love to
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
see those resources that potential
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
resources for appointment of council to
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
be used for other purposes
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the and I think that the other thing
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we see is on some of our cases when
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
there are attorneys appointed they're
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
doing an extraordinary job and others
 
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
they are really delaying the process and
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
permanency for our kids is delayed
 
01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
because of continuances and and appeals
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
that are made so we would just add that
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
that smaller piece but it is but it is a
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.649 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the
 
01:47:47.699 --> 01:47:48.410 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the
um

01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
so so you're looking at
 
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.129 align:start position:0%
so so you're looking at
um

01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.330 --> 01:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation of a guardian ad litem
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
the court May appoint you're saying uh
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
add any party of the case the court
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah we were suggesting just striking
 
01:48:11.689 --> 01:48:11.699 align:start position:0%
um where the child's expressed interests
 
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
conflict with the recommendation for
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
dispositional orders of the guardian ad
 
01:48:17.219 --> 01:48:18.229 align:start position:0%
dispositional orders of the guardian ad
litem

01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
litem
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that under this chapter it would read
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
the court May appoints an attorney to
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
represent the interest of the child in
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
any case brought abuse or neglect
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
brought pursuant to the chapter
 
01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.870 align:start position:0%
brought pursuant to the chapter
so

01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
and and just to clarify our attorney our
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
parents on all of our child abuse and
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
neglect cases are appointed counsel if
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
they are the petitioned party so they do
 
01:48:57.410 --> 01:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
well if I'm if I'm if I may ask it is
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
current the current language just
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
specific to the 535 bill in in the
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to 169 C 10.
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
we you're in support of the language as
 
01:49:14.639 --> 01:49:16.189 align:start position:0%
we you're in support of the language as
presented

01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
except you're striking part of it no
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're not in not in 535 we're just oh
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not for 5 35 at all not
 
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
as it currently reads so not 535 at all
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
no sir yeah I like to talk in how we are
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
today not what happens tomorrow but oh
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay so it's like right now as the way
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh has is is was retained
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
that language I apologize okay no I want
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
to make sure I want to learn anytime you
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
speak I want to make sure I learn it
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
correctly here uh from you the thing um
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
in the note section when I say note the
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
methodology of the 535 Bill I'm assuming
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
you read that yeah I don't have it in
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
front of me but yeah well let's see just
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
go from maybe memory here but you know
 
01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
where it says that
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
went in here
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
of the the changes
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
doesn't change it it's not really making
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
any change of the the Court's ability to
 
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh determine representation for a child
 
01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
and what I wanted to confirm for myself
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
is as a child is under 18.
 
01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:32.420 align:start position:0%
we typically yes
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
typically a night well at the moment I
 
01:50:39.169 --> 01:50:39.179 align:start position:0%
mean yes under 18 but if a child is in
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
the child if there is an open case a
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
child can extend their jurisdiction if
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
they have not graduated from high school
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so some of our are developmentally
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
just delayed uh young adults so
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction can be extended to 21.
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay just one final one it was just
 
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
with under the proposed amendment is
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
that it was still stating that the
 
01:51:05.209 --> 01:51:05.219 align:start position:0%
decision of whether to appoint a child
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm just doing the narration here
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
a child and attorney remains in the
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court and is not
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory quote in all cases and I say
 
01:51:15.770 --> 01:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
in quote to highlight that
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
that appears in my my opinion to be
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
where much conflict takes place is a
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
judge will say he's a dog on he or she
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
has a dog on Monday and a cat on Tuesday
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
on how they determine who gets
 
01:51:27.659 --> 01:51:28.790 align:start position:0%
on how they determine who gets
representation

01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
and should we have more or should we not
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
use the word shell more in these part in
 
01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
use the word shell more in these part in
this

01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
the evolution of this policy versus the
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
May what would be your recommendation we
 
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the shall appoint
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
um unless it's it's really carved out in
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and what what a unique circumstance
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
be a definitive
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
evidentiary proof of abuse and neglect
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
we feel very strongly that a child and a
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
child's attorney should not be part of
 
01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
the adjudicatory hearing at least the
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
initial draft of the language that we
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
had seen was upon the filing of a
 
01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.290 align:start position:0%
had seen was upon the filing of a
petition

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
petition
 
01:52:18.590 --> 01:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is well there
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
are a few reasons
 
01:52:23.209 --> 01:52:23.219 align:start position:0%
um if you have a child who is I mean
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
let's start with a child is
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
the victim of trauma regardless of
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the home it could be
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
domestic violence substance misuse
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
parents mental health a child should not
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
be responsible
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
um for being part of the process that
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
might of it throw their their family
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
into this system it should not be the
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
child's responsibility to
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be part of the family
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
history going forward that a parent
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
might if a child is being honest about
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on what's going on in the
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
home that child could be responsible
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
for wow now dcyf is involved with our
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
family and the tension that could come
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
from that in addition I mean we've got
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
the potential of a child being
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
influenced by a parent to
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
perjure themselves to not give accurate
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony or to tell their attorney not
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
to give don't downplay don't tell them
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the home and just
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
already for a child who's undergoing so
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
much it's so tumultuous and scary that
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
we should not have a child be part of
 
01:53:32.689 --> 01:53:32.699 align:start position:0%
this system that the adults the the
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
people who have reported and are the
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
witnesses should be the ones responsible
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
so from Casa's perspective not having a
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
child have that responsibility so in
 
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
terms of the timing of if counsel were
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
appointed for the child that that
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
Council does not participate in proving
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
or disproving the petition that has been
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
filed regardless of the child's position
 
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
because a three-year-old might say I
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
want to go home I miss my mom but you
 
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's debatable and don't and I'm not
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
going to be funny but but that's what
 
01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
this is about and what by about meaning
 
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
what the subject matter and I'm just
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
looking for guidance from our members
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
here is what is this appropriate
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
language Where We Are
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the May in the show
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
or is what or how or how it's
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
operating now is that
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
the pro uh acceptable to in this case to
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
Casa I think that as as we said earlier
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
we're not in support of House Bill 535
 
01:54:49.619 --> 01:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
we're not in support of House Bill 535
um and

01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
but we do recognize There's an
 
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity within our current statute
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
to expand that opportunity for
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for our courts to appoint an
 
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
attorney in in other circumstances so
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:55:11.930 --> 01:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
we're just suggesting and again we're
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting as an aside to House
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 535 that there is an opportunity
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
for expand our current statute to be
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
more inclusive and to be able to provide
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
a broader opportunity for our courts to
 
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
appoint attorneys for children in this
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
one and that statute is 169. 169 c yeah
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay 10 10 10. all right thank you
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
in my notes I didn't hear any non-profit
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
that was in support of
 
01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital 535 has written
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
so it's up to this subcommittee if we
 
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
want to do a deep dive and completely
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
put in language that's not in here that
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the committee I
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't know where you want to go with
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
that I like I said earlier I agree
 
01:56:05.699 --> 01:56:06.350 align:start position:0%
that I like I said earlier I agree
um

01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know I agree where a child shouldn't
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
be in the uh in the system making you
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
know even hearing those arguments with
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
parents and their attorneys
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that attorneys are
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
needed for the best interest of the
 
01:56:24.169 --> 01:56:24.179 align:start position:0%
child I know Casa has the best interest
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
on a child
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
um but I do feel that I believe that
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
children would
 
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:32.570 align:start position:0%
children would
um

01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
would feel more empowered knowing that
 
01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
whatever the result I had somebody who
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
was responsible to take care of me you
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
know uh which which I agree with so
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
I mean the more I look at what we're
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
discussing the change is a total
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
upside down
 
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
from this bill and I don't know if the
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wants to get into that
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
discussion to change the bill or wait
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
for legislation to come forward
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
next year or this year or 24 actually to
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
address this that that would be up to
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
the committee I I would say we I tell it
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
and because there is in my opinion too
 
01:57:18.169 --> 01:57:18.179 align:start position:0%
much language that needs a change on
 
01:57:18.179 --> 01:57:21.649 align:start position:0%
much language that needs a change on
this

01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
think it's just now we can this is
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
different it's my first time on this
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
kind of committee we can just discuss
 
01:57:31.370 --> 01:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
things right like right now so one of
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
the things I think it's important to
 
01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
keep in mind on this may shall language
 
01:57:38.770 --> 01:57:38.780 align:start position:0%
is that when when kiddos you know
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
abusers will use whatever they can to
 
01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
weaponize and they'll make it look like
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're the victim in the meantime but
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
coming out for these children
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're going to have to
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
have representation and we're not
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to the discretion of the
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
Court looking at the entire case and how
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's going it actually could be a bigger
 
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
problem because say you have an
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old and you automatically you
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
know put them and make them involved in
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
all this that eight-year-old doesn't
 
01:58:04.609 --> 01:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
know anything different like what they
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
have at home is their normal so it's not
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
like they're going to come out and say
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this is abuse they don't get it
 
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
and so it really further weaponizes the
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
system unfortunately it's I think it's
 
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
meant you know it's in good faith to try
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
to make it better but it's one of those
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
cases where it can really further
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
weaponize it
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I actually
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Seidel uh had fantastic
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
questions uh and we've got great answers
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
and that's when I was looking at this
 
01:58:45.179 --> 01:58:46.609 align:start position:0%
and that's when I was looking at this
saying

01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
that uh or answer it yourself the
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
current language needs a lot of change
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
as far as gossip is concerned in in HB
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
535 yeah yes oh yeah great and I would
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
ask the children Law Center to come
 
01:59:11.689 --> 01:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
forward and ask if that's the same case
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
um OCA
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh Waypoint whomever wants to come up
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
with that same case and and I'm under
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
the impression that the answer will be
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes it needs a lot of change so we'll be
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
up to this subcommittee do we want to do
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
get something in this to have it
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
acceptable to us to bring It Forward
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we want to dig that deep
 
01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:37.370 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we want to dig that deep
into

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
um you know into fixing this bill
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay as a subcommittee and then bringing
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
it to the full committee which they
 
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
didn't have the opportunity that we're
 
01:59:47.699 --> 01:59:49.129 align:start position:0%
didn't have the opportunity that we're
having

01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:59:51.970 --> 01:59:51.980 align:start position:0%
discussing this
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I do I'm in concert with
 
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative long I believe what this
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
needs is a Cooperative collaboration
 
02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
with the Intelligentsia that we have
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
and to have a study committee on this
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
and the study committee is to give it
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
the time to do a bill that can be vetted
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately and you know for the
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
nuances it's not saying I don't I would
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
say everyone wants to do the right thing
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
the first time but it's to know what
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
what the collateral effects if now you
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
say open a door but when where and how
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
fast so it's uh that's what I I would
 
02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
offer us to consider is a recommending
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
02:00:34.609 --> 02:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
not that a study committee be
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
or with reference
 
02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
represent Greg in what she put forward
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
and with representative long and I do
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
agree that we're dealing with children's
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
lives and I do think we need to look at
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
this a lot more closely before moving
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
forward so I do concur with you that we
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
should do a lot more research before
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative question uh I don't know
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
could we could we
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
asked to study for a study Commission on
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
so it will be amended to be a study
 
02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
so it will be amended to be a study
committee

02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
for a study commission I I'm not sure if
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
we could do that in the second year
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
okay so this has to be
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass ritl has amended
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:42.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman thank you is it
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
um do we know if
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
discuss that here if there is any are
 
02:02:00.770 --> 02:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
any lsrs that have been filed related to
 
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:03.300 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
because I think a study committee
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
I just would hate to keep putting it
 
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
farther down hoping that potentially if
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
there is some legis an LSR currently
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we could do some work this
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
session to get it going versus a study
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
committee which would just take longer
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
for these kids yeah so so uh that there
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
is uh however I'm not sure if the house
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
is going to accept it because we have a
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill uh with the same language I I know
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was turned down on a OLS filing
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
because there are Bills currently
 
02:02:44.089 --> 02:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
retained that address that subject
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay I and I absolutely understand the
 
02:03:03.890 --> 02:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
non-profits this is an opportunity we we
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
some of us clearly know where we want
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys and and I get that this is an
 
02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:11.219 align:start position:0%
opportunity and it's exciting that we
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
could revamp this bill to get what we
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
really want
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
however the more I think of it
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has the knowledge this
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
is going to go to the full committee
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
which they're not going to have what we
 
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
have and and
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think that would make it more
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
complicated and and I wish to remain on
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
the safe side uh to get both parties
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing yes this is absolutely needed
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
here's where we're going to start uh
 
02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:43.139 align:start position:0%
then then have a battle over this uh and
 
02:03:46.570 --> 02:03:46.580 align:start position:0%
not set the policy in my opinion where
 
02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
anything further from Casa
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center I think I can
 
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
probably speak loud enough do you need
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
me to
 
02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
me to
okay

02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:24.830 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm I'm happy to answer any
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
questions I I um
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
I I would say that our so the children's
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
Law Center provides legal representation
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
to children involved in in child welfare
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
proceedings and at-risk children
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
generally but we do provide
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
representation to kids in 169 C
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
proceeding so so we have that experience
 
02:04:53.229 --> 02:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
I I take it that the committee is
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
we are we are not interested in
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
advocating for counsel for children in
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
other types of Family Division
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
proceedings so so my comments are just
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
about 169 c
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I I without I'm not an expert on
 
02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
legislative procedure but I I will say
 
02:05:14.770 --> 02:05:14.780 align:start position:0%
that I do think the this this
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
um could work on an amendment that is a
 
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
relatively robust Amendment to the
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
existing legislation
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
um if it
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
felt that it wanted to do the work now
 
02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
and could bring it back to the main
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
committee I this is an issue that should
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
be addressed sooner than later by the
 
02:05:44.330 --> 02:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislature children you have made
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
children parties to abuse and neglect
 
02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
proceedings and as a matter of law they
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
are also victims but they are the only
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
party that does not currently have the
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
representation of counsel children have
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
extensive legal rights in 169 per C
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings they have legal rights that
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
are afforded to them in the child
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
protection act itself they have legal
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
rights through 170 g21 which is the
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
Foster children's Bill of Rights and
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
they also have due process rights so
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
they have constitutional rights but they
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
don't currently have a legal
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative to advocate for those
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
rights there are are 36 or 37 other
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
states Who currently afford children the
 
02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
right to counsel in abuse and neglect
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
proceedings so there is a robust data
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
and research and and track records
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
established in other states I I
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that you don't need
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
a study commission we can certainly
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
provide you with research and data the
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the thrust of which is that the
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
best practices are to provide counsel
 
02:07:04.689 --> 02:07:04.699 align:start position:0%
for children
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to speak further about other
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
details to address some of what Marty
 
02:07:14.639 --> 02:07:15.669 align:start position:0%
details to address some of what Marty
sink

02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
sink
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
said if you would like I I think that a
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
fully discretionary
 
02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
fully discretionary
um

02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:28.609 --> 02:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
the amending the the current bill such
 
02:07:31.129 --> 02:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
that I I think this is what Casa has
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
recommended that the right to council
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
would be entirely discussion
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary so so that that's a
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
contradictory statement so it wouldn't
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
be a right to counsel but the the
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
ability to appoint counsel being
 
02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
entirely discretionary in my view would
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
not get us very far uh children uh
 
02:07:55.129 --> 02:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
children don't know to ask for lawyers
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and so I worry that a uh although a
 
02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
fully discretionary a judge's ability to
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
in any case uh is a is a step
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
further than
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the way the statute is currently worded
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
it it is a very very small step uh and I
 
02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
think the legislature can do better
 
02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so right from
 
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
the get-go we have already have
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
conflicts between entities that have the
 
02:08:28.739 --> 02:08:29.689 align:start position:0%
conflicts between entities that have the
best

02:08:29.689 --> 02:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
the best of children in mind and I
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with all of your
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
entities that you do have the best
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
interests of the child of mine and then
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I love your advice to me I lean
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
heavily on that Vice
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
um so you consider you you called for a
 
02:08:46.139 --> 02:08:47.209 align:start position:0%
um so you consider you you called for a
robust

02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
robust
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment what are we talking about two
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
or three pages
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
no I I think we've got it down to a page
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh in in your opinion how much of
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
this current language in here would
 
02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:01.970 align:start position:0%
this current language in here would
change

02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
and 535. so I don't have a I I worked
 
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with I don't have a copy of
 
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
it in front of me but I I know that it
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
was a relatively minor change to the
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:17.659 align:start position:0%
um the the way
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
the way I see it there would probably be
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
if we do a Carvel that would provide the
 
02:09:27.649 --> 02:09:27.659 align:start position:0%
absolute right to counsel in certain
 
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
cases so council at risk of placement
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
and we could we could probably drill
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
down on what risk means that would be uh
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
additional language
 
02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.430 align:start position:0%
additional language
um

02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh there might be addition there might
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
be other language that makes uh that
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that makes provides a path for a child
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be advised about the right to counsel
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that might be an extra provision
 
02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.330 align:start position:0%
so that might be an extra provision
um

02:09:58.330 --> 02:09:58.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
we also would want to suggest to the
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislature for inclusion in this
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that the attorney have the
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
right to access records it is currently
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult for us to access our own
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
clients records in these proceedings and
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
so that would be something we would want
 
02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature to consider but this is
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
these are I mean this is discrete
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
language I'm just sort of giving you the
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
bullet point list currently the statute
 
02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
allows uh attorneys well children who
 
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
have attorneys appointed for them allows
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
the attorneys to petition the court for
 
02:10:39.649 --> 02:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
funds for services other than Council
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
that is Money Paid through the Indigent
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
defense fund
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
we'd like the legislature to include in
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation a procedure that allows
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys to make that request without
 
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
input from the other parties in the the
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
same way that those requests are made
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
made in delinquency and adult criminal
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
legal proceedings so those are some of
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
the bullet points
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I believe there was five or six
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
changes that's not currently in here
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's right so
 
02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:15.229 align:start position:0%
that's right so
um

02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
it may be simple to delete a line but
 
02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
but you're adding five or more which
 
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing that there's a consensus
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
on with all the entities that have the
 
02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:26.990 align:start position:0%
on with all the entities that have the
best

02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
interest on a child in mind so that's
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
what the complication is because my
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
02:11:33.659 --> 02:11:34.189 align:start position:0%
understanding is
um

02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this retained bills
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
be out
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
by uh November 15th or November 17th
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know and I don't know if the
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee has a hole
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
um could do their due diligence and all
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
02:11:56.209 --> 02:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
I understand the urgency
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
I understand there is language there's
 
02:12:03.530 --> 02:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
other language in the other 35 States
 
02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.370 align:start position:0%
other language in the other 35 States
um

02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
you know but again we're dealing with
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hospital 535
 
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the subcommittee whether
 
02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
we feel that
 
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
redo it
 
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
or you know and I'd be in favor of
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
redoing it
 
02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
if it was a lot if it was
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
related to me a little simple you know
 
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
simplified which I'm not hearing that it
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
is uh and you know uh
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
due diligence of the full committee I
 
02:12:38.689 --> 02:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
think would be missing and I would be
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
afraid uh that we may not be heading
 
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
down the right Road and that would be
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
that would be you know a complication uh
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah I personally I believe again
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're on itl 535 and uh
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
get bills in for this year
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
um to the to the Senate no uh for the to
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
Ms Wilford one uh
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
question mark a comment and ask your
 
02:13:18.179 --> 02:13:19.669 align:start position:0%
question mark a comment and ask your
guidance

02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the in uh line three on the bill
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
where it said this isn't where it's uh
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
the changes on this on this effort was
 
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
in cases involving a neglected or abused
 
02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
in cases involving a neglected or abused
child

02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:13:31.199 --> 02:13:32.330 align:start position:0%
child
only

02:13:32.330 --> 02:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:13:35.530 --> 02:13:35.540 align:start position:0%
it wasn't talking uh across the board
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
would that not be a defect in the bill
 
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.069 align:start position:0%
would that not be a defect in the bill
inherently

02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
inherently
 
02:13:45.010 --> 02:13:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.169 --> 02:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
again children playing a role in in the
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
cases come for children and family law
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
aren't that aren't there are those
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
neglected and abused but we'll have that
 
02:13:58.850 --> 02:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh label put on them put on them in that
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
case but there's also other other
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
challenges like uh that could be taking
 
02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
place and I don't have the legal correct
 
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
legal terms to use
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
but do we need more of an more of an
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
open description than uh and and then
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
what we have here which just says in
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
cases of neglected and abused
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
well if you're not neglected or abused
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
but there's other uh it could be medical
 
02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
issues you know that dealing with with
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
um a child a uh a minor let me let me
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
see if I
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'll answer the question the way I
 
02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
understand it and you you tell me if I'm
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not giving you the the answer no I
 
02:14:39.649 --> 02:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
want your answer not what I'm telling
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
you it should be no well so uh
 
02:14:43.679 --> 02:14:47.050 align:start position:0%
you it should be no well so uh
so

02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
my organization provides representation
 
02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
in abuse and neglect cases and and so
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
that is our Focus we we
 
02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.050 align:start position:0%
that is our Focus we we
um

02:14:56.050 --> 02:14:56.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:58.609 --> 02:14:58.619 align:start position:0%
our clients typically are growing up in
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
poverty there's a very large
 
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:01.850 align:start position:0%
poverty there's a very large
intersection

02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
between children growing up in poverty
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the abuse and elect and neglect
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
process children in in the legislature
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
has identified children as parties in
 
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect proceedings and and I
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that that that is
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in other areas of
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
family law and so I can't I can't tell
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
you much there but my impression is that
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
children probably are not parties to
 
02:15:29.930 --> 02:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
those proceedings in abuse and neglect
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
cases the the caption of the case is the
 
02:15:35.930 --> 02:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
child's name in the interest of child's
 
02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:36.950 align:start position:0%
child's name in the interest of child's
name

02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and so what what other states have
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
determined and what we think is the best
 
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
practice is that children who are
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
victims of abuse and neglect who will
 
02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
have decisions made in their cases which
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
which carry out over the course of well
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
it should be 12 months but typically
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
much longer in abuse and neglect
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings that children have the
 
02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have legal counsel and
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
legal advocacy in those cases which will
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
determine the balance of the course of
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
well that's a debating point and you
 
02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
know and I what's debating on it is what
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
is the primary issue that can be proved
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh but and by proving in a court
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
environment and uh and
 
02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's not necessarily abuse or
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
neglect I mean again with that's that
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
particular Silo as I'll call it but
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
there's medical issues developmental
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities and so on when they're
 
02:16:33.049 --> 02:16:33.059 align:start position:0%
doing their best but it's not happening
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and they meaning the parent
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
parents or parent and it's just looking
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
here when do they have a a court
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
represent representative for that
 
02:16:42.599 --> 02:16:44.089 align:start position:0%
represent representative for that
specialty

02:16:44.089 --> 02:16:44.099 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and not not for a crime per se but for a
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
specialty and not just seeing how broad
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
this this broader this could be
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes it could be I mean that's an access
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
to Justice question uh probably and
 
02:16:59.929 --> 02:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
there are many gaps in our legal systems
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
where we don't provide attorneys who
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful for people who
 
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
need them but this we've identified as a
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
very particular and acute need for
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
representation right I did consider I
 
02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
did consider you my access to Justice by
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
the way so from what I was hoping you
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
provide some guidance in that regard uh
 
02:17:21.530 --> 02:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
when I um offer I mean I'm just going
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
back to my history I've been been here
 
02:17:30.049 --> 02:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
over 20 years and uh in in terms of uh I
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
say a study committee not just a code
 
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
word for it needs more work okay and uh
 
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
and this and and I'm one that does so
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
let's get it done while we're young so
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's that to have it done before
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
the end of the of the term and it's
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
either a recommendation you know uh for
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
what the wording is or it's continued
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
for a build to be file filed for the
 
02:17:54.169 --> 02:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
next session in the fall I think of 24.
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
but uh not for me I'm not about delayed
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
taxes or anything it's just say we we
 
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
have tremendous assets you being one
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
that to help on this and then but to do
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
it right the first time and uh and and
 
02:18:09.290 --> 02:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
again that's why it was bringing up the
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
term study committee uh so that this
 
02:18:14.929 --> 02:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
would continue but that's with support
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the recommendation of of all members
 
02:18:19.969 --> 02:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
here but I saw that this does need more
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
work and has long pointed out well don't
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
have to repeat what the gentleman said
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's work is needed on this and
 
02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.019 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
the classic case it's not ready for
 
02:18:32.929 --> 02:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
prime time and uh so the night no no
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're not supporting the bill is
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
written would that be a correct
 
02:18:38.089 --> 02:18:38.099 align:start position:0%
statement that's correct thank you
 
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
Joanna finally okay
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
got an answer of yes from you uh but
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
anyway that was it uh for myself that
 
02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:47.870 align:start position:0%
anyway that was it uh for myself that
representative

02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman so my question would
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
be if there's a way because
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
we have two wonderful organizations here
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
that are thinking in what I'm saying is
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
thinking a little differently but is
 
02:19:00.770 --> 02:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
there a way to find a common area where
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
we can make some changes to moving
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
forward but still keep it on the table
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
so that we still can add to it so we're
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
not waiting a whole nother you know year
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
or so but we could somehow find a
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
compromise that's going to meet the
 
02:19:18.290 --> 02:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
needs of the children and start the
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
process moving forward and then still
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
come back and and think about how could
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
we make this better
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
is is that a possibility
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
I I think that's always possible
 
02:19:30.599 --> 02:19:31.490 align:start position:0%
I I think that's always possible
um

02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
when we have we have had we've had had
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
discussions with Casa and I should point
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
out that New Hampshire legal assistance
 
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
is also here as is the disability rights
 
02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:41.629 align:start position:0%
is also here as is the disability rights
Center

02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
Center
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
um and so we have engaged in those
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
conversations I don't think it's out of
 
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
the question that we could could
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
continue to have conversations
 
02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.730 align:start position:0%
continue to have conversations
it

02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
it is a possibility we have not yet uh
 
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
we have not yet found
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
Common Ground entirely
 
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
but not entirely but at least a starting
 
02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
but not entirely but at least a starting
point

02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
well I think we agree that the we agree
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
with Casa that the fully a Court's
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
ability fully discretionary ability to
 
02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel is
 
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
is a step in the right direction we just
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a step far enough and I
 
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
think that Casa would say that what we
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
are proposing is a step too far uh and
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where the
 
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
so we can find that middle ground to
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
start just to get the ball going and
 
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
then come back so we don't end up with
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
something where we're asking too much
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
that is a good plan I'm sorry
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm done
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment
 
02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
sorry back to this one so I think that
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
that is I think we're all working
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
towards a progressive language and stuff
 
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
I just don't think we're going to find
 
02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
it in 5 35 I mean it basically is like a
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
a gutting of this of what um
 
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Hill wanted in the
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
beginning too so I just think yes I
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
agree we need legislation and there are
 
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
ways to go about it that's
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
more amicable I think but I I'm
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
continuing on with what representative
 
02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
long said that this I think this should
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
be itl I think it just is a full
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
skeleton project at this point with uh
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
so far two people disagreeing with the
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
anything further Miss waffle no thank
 
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
you so much all right thank you for your
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
time today
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so so uh I I see I
 
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
believe where representative ball is
 
02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:44.690 align:start position:0%
believe where representative ball is
going

02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's a small bite that
 
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
we could do
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
02:21:54.650 --> 02:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
not a lot of changes
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I can only speak for myself I'd
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
be willing to meet two or three times
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
before the end of October on this
 
02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to get that simple language
 
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
that could be easily
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you know easily explained to the full
 
02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.510 align:start position:0%
um you know easily explained to the full
committee

02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
instead of uh all the vessels that that
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
you wanted to add to it which I'm open
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
to and I agree that it may be in the
 
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
if we if we could get agreement with
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
those involved with
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
you know something that starts this off
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
because I think that if we can get a
 
02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.730 align:start position:0%
because I think that if we can get a
positive

02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
positive
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
policy on this
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh in January because I believe that's
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
when it would come to the house floor by
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
both parties agreeing I think that
 
02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
starts us off in the right direction for
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
the for
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
24 to get some tweaks
 
02:22:58.370 --> 02:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I don't know if that would
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
be possible Mr chairman or or you know
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
what what the rest of the committee is
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
thinking that this time
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
my view is with with the respect to
 
02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative long that I would not
 
02:23:17.809 --> 02:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
want to support that uh that's a death
 
02:23:20.929 --> 02:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
of a Thousand Cuts in my view and uh is
 
02:23:23.929 --> 02:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
to do it I'm not just I like to walk the
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
talk but let's do it right the first
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
time and that's why I was recommending
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
the the study committee that we really
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
look at the bill that 535 be in the
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we can utilize it do
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
something to be voted on before the end
 
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
of the term
 
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh but quite a lot to do like just part
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
of it and then see how it works out that
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
will be a delayed tactic not not by us
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
but by others in the next term and
 
02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
we then this will be continued on at you
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
know ad hominem and I that's why I would
 
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:56.570 align:start position:0%
know ad hominem and I that's why I would
not

02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:23:58.370 --> 02:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
I would ask we not consider that
 
02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
strategy it's either we do a total
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
revamp of the bill I mean uh as opposed
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
to it yelling which means it's it's on
 
02:24:08.570 --> 02:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
the Hiatus and until a new bill uh is
 
02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:09.950 align:start position:0%
the Hiatus and until a new bill uh is
generated

02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
generated
 
02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:11.819 align:start position:0%
but still work has to be done as to how
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
would that bill and the wording of that
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
bill be brought to the table
 
02:24:18.889 --> 02:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
and they'll collaboratively
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
so I mean so that that's where I
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh I I
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
I could agree with uh with what they
 
02:24:34.910 --> 02:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
just said however studying a house bill
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh 535 is like uh I'm gonna turn my uh
 
02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
63 Dodge Dart that has flat tires
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
the engines
 
02:24:48.770 --> 02:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
burnt uh into a Ferrari
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
um because this isn't not the place to
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
start we we all agree that this isn't
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
the place to start so that that's
 
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.170 --> 02:25:02.180 align:start position:0%
you know again
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's two choices in my mind one is to
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
itl 535
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
or the other one is to get a uh much
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
smaller agreement with everybody
 
02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um that the concept
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
of uh attorneys for uh abuse of
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
neglected children
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
um is a concept that we all agree with
 
02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:25.100 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know the health session in January
 
02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
which I'm thinking this will be coming
 
02:25:35.210 --> 02:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
up and then uh work towards uh better
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
language uh as we move forward
 
02:25:40.370 --> 02:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
um so that and that would be up to the
 
02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
um so that and that would be up to the
uh

02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh to the subcommittee um you know I
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean as far as I'm concerned uh
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
hey thank you did the uh Disability
 
02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.070 align:start position:0%
hey thank you did the uh Disability
Rights

02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
02:26:00.530 --> 02:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
folks have any comment to make or would
 
02:26:04.849 --> 02:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I wanted to take advantage of you
 
02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
Center I think that Lisa Wilford
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
actually spoke for the group that I'm
 
02:26:20.809 --> 02:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
involved with the juvenile rights policy
 
02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
group and that consists of Waypoint the
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
ACLU New Hampshire legal assistance the
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
children's rights the children's Law
 
02:26:28.319 --> 02:26:29.690 align:start position:0%

Center

02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
Center
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
um who am I missing new Futures uh I
 
02:26:34.270 --> 02:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
think I got like everyone got everyone
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I mean
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
we really think that there needs to be
 
02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the changes that Lisa Wilford outlined
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
we need to have a right established for
 
02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
children to have counsel when they're at
 
02:26:48.170 --> 02:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
risk of placement in congregate
 
02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:49.450 align:start position:0%
risk of placement in congregate
facilities

02:26:49.450 --> 02:26:49.460 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
Bledsoe is a good example of what
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
terrible things happen when children are
 
02:26:57.710 --> 02:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
sent out of state and children need to
 
02:26:59.770 --> 02:26:59.780 align:start position:0%
have someone in their Corner an attorney
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
and we understand that the judge's role
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
is to make a decision about what's in
 
02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child that
 
02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
Casa's role is to present to the court
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
about what's in the best interest of the
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
child it's also in the best interest of
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
the child to enable them to have a voice
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
in these proceedings that really
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
directly impact their lives
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
so it's a step forward to expand
 
02:27:29.690 --> 02:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
discretion for a court appointment but
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's really not what's in the best
 
02:27:33.889 --> 02:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
interest of the children
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
in our state who are at risk of
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
placement at some pretty
 
02:27:39.889 --> 02:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
challenging facilities where they're
 
02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
even if it's a good facility they're
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
being separated from their friends their
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
schools their families and to have
 
02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
someone in their corner to assist them
 
02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
is really important it's also what Most
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
states do across the country I think New
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of only a handful that
 
02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee a right to counsel for
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
children independency cases
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
so maybe this isn't the vehicle to do
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:28:07.010 --> 02:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
we really hope that this committee and
 
02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
that the legislature will fully consider
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the importance of guaranteeing a right
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
to counsel for really vulnerable
 
02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:15.469 align:start position:0%
to counsel for really vulnerable
children

02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
thanks what was your full name again
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's always Ms Rosenberg to me you can
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you any anything oh
 
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Rosenberg thank
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
you oh Karen I should say and um legal
 
02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
assistance did they would you give any
 
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
comments to what we haven't given
 
02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:40.910 align:start position:0%
comments to what we haven't given
comments

02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
um my name is Michelle wonger and I'm
 
02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire legal assistance and
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
I I Echo everything uh my colleagues
 
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
from the disabilities rights Center and
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the children's Law Center have said I
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
think what's really interesting about
 
02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:56.060 align:start position:0%
this issue is there's so much agreement
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the benefits that Casa brings to
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
the table
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and then there's also agreement that
 
02:29:03.889 --> 02:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
they're in in certain certain
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances that they really need is a
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
need for Council to bring a legal
 
02:29:10.969 --> 02:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
perspective to the child and I think
 
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
there was a conversation earlier about
 
02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
about attorneys sort of getting in the
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
way of finding permanency for kids and I
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
think what's challenging about that
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
perspective is that
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
if a child has counsel the council's job
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
isn't to blindly say child you want to
 
02:29:31.730 --> 02:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
go home that's what I'm going to argue
 
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
you for that's not what an attorney does
 
02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
what an attorney does is talk to the
 
02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
child about their perfect world and
 
02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
really flush out what the child wants
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
why they want it and then talk to the
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
child about options as an attorney who
 
02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
has represented kids in all kinds of
 
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
different Juvenile Justice cases
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
attorney can do is know about all of the
 
02:30:00.530 --> 02:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
options available to a child and then
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
what their legal rights are to pursue
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
those options and then use the law to
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
pursue those options for them and when a
 
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
child is in court and they're told that
 
02:30:13.130 --> 02:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
the only options for you are to go home
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
to an unsafe environment or go to a
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
facility like Bledsoe and nobody knows
 
02:30:22.969 --> 02:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
all their rights to other legal options
 
02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
and how to vigorously pursue those legal
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
options that child is at a disadvantage
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
so under current Supreme Court law we
 
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
think the bare minimum is that there is
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
a full discretionary right to council
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
which must include notification to a
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
child of their right to request counsel
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
but we think that that leaves a child
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
children at a severe disadvantage to
 
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
actually access counsel and reap the
 
02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
benefits of legal advocacy to not only
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
pursue their desires but truly be
 
02:31:00.349 --> 02:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
counseled on the array of legal options
 
02:31:02.889 --> 02:31:02.899 align:start position:0%
available to them and how to move those
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
those desires forward and so that's the
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
reason why we're in support of an
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
expanded legislation we're happy to
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
continue working with Casa to find
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
Common Ground there was a time we
 
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
thought that might be close and you know
 
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
I think things have moved in the right
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
direction but I'm still optimistic that
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is space for common ground and I
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
hope to continue working through this
 
02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
process with them ideally this session
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
either here in this committee or in the
 
02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:34.190 align:start position:0%
either here in this committee or in the
Senate

02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.410 --> 02:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
any questions representative law
 
02:31:39.250 --> 02:31:39.260 align:start position:0%
uh so Michelle do you think House Bill
 
02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
535 is the
 
02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:45.010 align:start position:0%
535 is the
legislation

02:31:45.010 --> 02:31:45.020 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
I was disappointed to hear that perhaps
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
another bill couldn't be brought in this
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
in this session if that one were to die
 
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
um but no I don't think that that's my
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
favorite vehicle to bring this forward
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if there's another vehicle to bring
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
this forward in a way that you know
 
02:32:04.969 --> 02:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
isn't years down the road I would I
 
02:32:06.410 --> 02:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
would love to look at those options
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
right so so and just to confirm uh you
 
02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
actually you also agree with the urgency
 
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
of something going I do I believe that
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
the current law is not compliant with
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
federal law because it does not allow a
 
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
judge to exercise full discretion and
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
appointment of counsel and if that were
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
to taken on appeal to the New Hampshire
 
02:32:31.790 --> 02:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I think that the current
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
law would likely be invalidated very
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
with anyone else like to offer some
 
02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:44.929 align:start position:0%
with anyone else like to offer some
comments

02:32:44.929 --> 02:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.939 --> 02:32:51.889 align:start position:0%
 
nope

02:32:51.889 --> 02:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
I know we've been mentioned a couple
 
02:32:55.969 --> 02:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
times here today my name is Alyssa
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
Matthew I'm the attorney for the office
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
of child advocate
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
um we work closely with all of the
 
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
groups that are here today we don't sit
 
02:33:05.450 --> 02:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
specifically on that policy group but we
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
have certainly talked to all of these
 
02:33:09.650 --> 02:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
different groups after the Bledsoe
 
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
report we've also talked with a number
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
of legislators including chairman
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson and representative long
 
02:33:19.010 --> 02:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to mention from the
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
office of child Advocates view we agree
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
with the idea that the Court's ability
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
to appoint counsel should be expanded to
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
any point in a Judicial proceeding in
 
02:33:32.330 --> 02:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect Arena as has been
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
stated here and should not be predicated
 
02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
just on a conflict with Casa beyond that
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of great ideas in the
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
room the one that the office of child
 
02:33:43.969 --> 02:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
advocate feels quite strongly about
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
based on our Bledsoe report is the need
 
02:33:49.309 --> 02:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
for children in the abuse and neglect
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
Arena that are currently in residential
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
placement or at risk of residential
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
placement shall have attorneys
 
02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
based on what we saw from that Bledsoe
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
report one of the boys that were in that
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
facility did in fact have a casa and
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
Casa had a very difficult time accessing
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
that child that we believe an attorney
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
would not have had quite the same
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
barriers and that was a 169 C case so I
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to bring that for forward
 
02:34:17.809 --> 02:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
that those are the pieces that the
 
02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate feels very
 
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
strongly about that residential
 
02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
strongly about that residential
placement

02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
placement
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
peace and we do believe though there are
 
02:34:27.410 --> 02:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
guard rails potentially definitions
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
around what at risk of residential
 
02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:30.770 align:start position:0%
around what at risk of residential
placement

02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
placement
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
could mean
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
um perhaps HP 535 is not the vehicle
 
02:34:37.490 --> 02:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
there has been some legislation put
 
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
forth around our recommendations from
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Bledsoe report by the house and
 
02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
discussions with other representatives
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
think anything further
 
02:34:53.210 --> 02:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
okay we thank you very much for your
 
02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:56.090 align:start position:0%
okay we thank you very much for your
comments

02:34:56.090 --> 02:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else would like to offer
 
02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.389 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else would like to offer
their

02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:34:59.399 --> 02:35:01.849 align:start position:0%
their
comments

02:35:01.849 --> 02:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I think it it stops this vehicle
 
02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
which has been determined by many here
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
to not be the right vehicle but it
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that's the only you
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
know thing that we have for this session
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
or whatever but I do I do think
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
back to Pat's you know analogy of the
 
02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
cars and stuff we can't take this
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
clunker in I just think it's like it's
 
02:35:48.889 --> 02:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
just too much I think this one has to be
 
02:35:50.809 --> 02:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
ideal I don't think that
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
um this is in the best interest of
 
02:35:53.929 --> 02:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
anyone to try to work with this
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully disagree with with
 
02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that the longer we've put
 
02:36:10.670 --> 02:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
this off the more children are at risk
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
for having greater issue in what they've
 
02:36:14.809 --> 02:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
been going through without legal
 
02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
representation I think there is some
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
some work that we could do on this as it
 
02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
it is needed without
 
02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
causing other further issues and further
 
02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:28.849 align:start position:0%
causing other further issues and further
delay

02:36:28.849 --> 02:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
delay
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
the only concern I have is like
 
02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative ball had said because
 
02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note that we cannot
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
present anything with the physical note
 
02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.090 --> 02:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
coming so I'll uh
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
if you'll accept the motion I'll move
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we recommend to the full committee
 
02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:55.969 align:start position:0%
that we recommend to the full committee
itl

02:36:55.969 --> 02:36:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:58.490 --> 02:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
here we have relate them
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have a motion to itl do we have a
 
02:37:09.170 --> 02:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
is there any further comment from
 
02:37:10.859 --> 02:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
is there any further comment from
members

02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
then I'll call for the vote
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:24.650 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
yes

02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
Greg yes
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative long yes
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative ball
yeah

02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
so in terms of recommending Ito
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is not a recommendation for us
 
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
to take the place of that is
 
02:37:59.330 --> 02:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
to utilize representative long
 
02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that is to have a couple
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
more meetings on this
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
but the attempt of having an amendment
 
02:38:08.809 --> 02:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh done on this bill
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
and to see if we can be successful this
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
in this term
 
02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh and that's such your recommendation
 
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
was one that is uh achievable within the
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
so if I may yeah representative long
 
02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so yeah I
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
I agree that that's possible with this
 
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's not the full alphabet in my opinion
 
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
it has to be uh for the due diligence of
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
the whole the committee as a whole uh
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
because this will be coming to the floor
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh of the whole committee at the end of
 
02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
August I believe
 
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know to take a smaller bite that
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
everybody could agree with
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think would be
 
02:39:11.330 --> 02:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
better for my best interest in getting
 
02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
attorneys for children
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I I don't like the three to three
 
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh and it's a party division this is not
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
a party issue and I don't want that
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
perception to be out there
 
02:39:26.809 --> 02:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
um so if we could get the groups
 
02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
together to make some recommendations to
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
us that could
 
02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:32.330 align:start position:0%
us that could
again

02:39:32.330 --> 02:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:39:34.969 --> 02:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
uh helping this issue if if that's at
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
all possible then I'd be willing to meet
 
02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
a couple times to see if we can't get
 
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
that done so
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
um I is there a motion needed uh missed
 
02:39:44.939 --> 02:39:45.830 align:start position:0%
um I is there a motion needed uh missed
wire

02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
wire
 
02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
on on uh
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
or or do we just adjourn uh to uh meet
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:59.399 --> 02:40:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:02.399 --> 02:40:06.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative ball
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if we can request
 
02:40:13.010 --> 02:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
that those who spoke submit their
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
a request yes as you're a representative
 
02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
ball asking for the guidance in a
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
written format and therefore when we
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
have our next meeting
 
02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
as I'll say
 
02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
I'll say in two weeks just to give time
 
02:40:37.969 --> 02:40:37.979 align:start position:0%
for for those who made their comments
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
today so we can have it emailed to us
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and then all members can be
 
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
prepared so that when we meet again uh
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be fully loaded with the
 
02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
information and then with what
 
02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations to make for a amendment
 
02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
to this bill and and then we can take at
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
that time a definitive uh vote of either
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
recommend the uh the change in the
 
02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:03.770 align:start position:0%
recommend the uh the change in the
language

02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh or or to ytl
 
02:41:08.809 --> 02:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
to see if see if this goal could be
 
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
attainable in that in that time frame
 
02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:13.130 align:start position:0%
attainable in that in that time frame
so

02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
no ball I'm sorry website long thank you
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
um she has a very large influence wow my
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
hair looking that good all right
 
02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
I know it does yeah yeah I I like when I
 
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
heard some of the discussion
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
um for example uh it seemed like there
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
was a connection with respect to those
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
that are in placement
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
however not uh those with the potential
 
02:41:45.650 --> 02:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
of being in placement so I mean
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
something that we could
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
grab onto
 
02:41:53.809 --> 02:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
um because the the whole you know what
 
02:41:56.090 --> 02:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
what some entities want
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
I can agree with that
 
02:42:00.650 --> 02:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think there's the time
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
frame with which to uh with which you
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
know the rest of the committee will have
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and and absorbing it
 
02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:42:12.969 --> 02:42:12.979 align:start position:0%
any anything that can be agreed upon
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
potential language on uh you know
 
02:42:17.929 --> 02:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
Crossing out whatever needs to be
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
crossed out adding whatever you you all
 
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know I think that gets us on the
 
02:42:27.770 --> 02:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
upper leg with respect to uh partisan uh
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
making it not partisan and uh best
 
02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so that would be
 
02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:43.750 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so that would be
appreciated

02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
is there a question from the audience
 
02:42:50.570 --> 02:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
you may approach the mic so we
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:55.429 --> 02:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we would like we
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
would be happy to meet with a group and
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
see what we can
 
02:43:00.290 --> 02:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
um come to agreement on
 
02:43:02.330 --> 02:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and bring that to the committee I
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're in agreement with
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
that agreement
 
02:43:07.730 --> 02:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
going back to the table
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
and working with
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
our partners in this
 
02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
and then bring something forward and
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
just an amendment which would be an
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
which I I'm assuming as it needs to be
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
in the form of an amendment for to 535
 
02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:25.250 align:start position:0%
in the form of an amendment for to 535
yes

02:43:25.250 --> 02:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:43:25.260 --> 02:43:26.210 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
and that that would be uh legal
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
assistance developmental disability casa
 
02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:33.530 align:start position:0%
assistance developmental disability casa
casa

02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
casa
 
02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
in office of child advocate sure so
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh children excuse me children law as
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
well so we have those entities
 
02:43:45.050 --> 02:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
I mean just getting together so there'll
 
02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
be some language that can be provided
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
then to us I think we can make yeah sure
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's either it's possible or
 
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:54.889 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's either it's possible or
if

02:43:54.889 --> 02:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's either possible or not but let's
 
02:43:58.130 --> 02:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
see if we can make something happen that
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
being said would a um
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
oh do you want to schedule another
 
02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
meeting that's right I was going to see
 
02:44:08.750 --> 02:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
what was rational based on the schedules
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
here would be like two weeks from now
 
02:44:15.050 --> 02:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
now for us to have a meeting again
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to have the narratives from
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
from you so we could have have them read
 
02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
and be prepared for if I'm correct the
 
02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
deadline would be November 17th that you
 
02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
bring this to
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
so my name is Chairman I've
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative long yes so I'm looking
 
02:44:49.490 --> 02:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
at uh we do have some subcommittee
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
meetings uh CFL subcommittee meetings on
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 10th
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
um but I I only got one maybe I'm
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'm on just that one committee yeah
 
02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.809 align:start position:0%
I'm on just that one committee yeah
subcommittee

02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
well before we then get to the date what
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh I would be an assumption of when uh
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
you would have a document of the
 
02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation ready for ready to
 
02:45:33.170 --> 02:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
provide to the subcommittee prior to and
 
02:45:34.969 --> 02:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
then we would meet after that I don't
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
want to make the decision for all of us
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
yeah but um just a guess but two to
 
02:45:40.849 --> 02:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
three weeks all right so with this then
 
02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:45.720 align:start position:0%

02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
during that week and the question to see
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%

02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:59.990 align:start position:0%

meeting so we'd be fully prepared to
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%

for that
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
that agreeable to all members sure
 
02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that's agreeable because it doesn't
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
happen without you folks making that
 
02:49:28.969 --> 02:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
