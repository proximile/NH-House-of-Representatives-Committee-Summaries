good morning uh it's 1002 and we'll go
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
ahead and get the division three work
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
session started here
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have several topics today to get to
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
know the department better
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
they're listed in the calendar
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
the first step is going going to be the
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner but let's
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
take also come on up we'll also just of
 
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.189 align:start position:0%
take also come on up we'll also just of
note

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
um at 2 30 we're going to begin a work
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
session on HB 49 and I just was informed
 
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
that that may have some conflict with
 
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
the Democratic caucus at three
 
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I I just heard the data and so I'm
 
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 align:start position:0%
still processing what the implications
 
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
are I I want to respect your need to
 
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.890 align:start position:0%
are I I want to respect your need to
caucus

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
and balance that with the need to try to
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
move the bill and the difficulty of
 
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
getting division one and three together
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's what I'm going to be
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about in background and we
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
could talk maybe at lunch or something
 
00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
about your thoughts on that
 
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.010 align:start position:0%
about your thoughts on that
um

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right so we're missing uh
 
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative hole I talked to him
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
today so I think he's alive and uh
 
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren is recovering
 
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.610 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren is recovering
she's

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
she's
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
oh okay good good good good
 
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 align:start position:0%

um our objective is to provide you with
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
an oversight of all of the various
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
operations that are performed within the
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner if you turn
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
to page two of the document in front of
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
you we'll be starting off with a
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
division of finance and procurement and
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
then I have Melissa sear here the chief
 
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
legal officer to discuss the office of
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%

Resources will follow that and then Mike
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
Lawless with the employee assistance
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
program that that's what we intend to
 
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
cover today on Friday we'll be
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
discussing or presenting on facilities
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity I.T and the
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
division of program quality and
 
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.650 align:start position:0%
division of program quality and
integrity

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
so that's all good um at what point do
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
you expect us to go uh taking plunges
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
into the the Budget prior to the release
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the governor's budget we we were
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
heavily in the overview and no money
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
discussion pretty much now we're heavy
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
into the money discussion so what how do
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
you see the interplay between this
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
presentation and uh the the budget
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of us sure So within
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:48.139 align:start position:0%
um we we have identified the specific
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
accounting information that we'll be
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
referring to as as we go through this so
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
the and my objective is to make it clear
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
to the committee so that you can tie the
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
activity or the operational function to
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
that specific account so rather than
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
simply going through the governor's
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
budget book without a lot of contacts
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be trying to do is
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
really tie the function to the dollars
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the accounting unit that that's my
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
goal and you know please let me know if
 
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
if we need to make modifications along
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
the way all right I'm ready excellent
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page three of the
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
presentation in front of you
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
um in I I have a high level overview of
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
the division of finance and procurement
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
Mission and the division of finance and
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
procurement it actually falls within one
 
00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:36.979 align:start position:0%
single accounting unit
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
and we have both the financial functions
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
as well as the Contracting and
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
procurement functions
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page four
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
that is where you'll see the accounting
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
unit it's 56.76 and in the governor's
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget it is on page
 
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.610 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget it is on page
1071.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
and this is that's genius by the way
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for putting the page numbers
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
on there absolutely absolutely
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
um and and as I said no if you could
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
just pause for like 30 seconds because I
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at the numbers get
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
get my right side of the brain ready or
 
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
so in 1071 I'm reading
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
office of business operations is but I'm
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
not seeing anywhere where it says
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
division of finance and procurement is
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
is the division within this office yeah
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
the the entire division is within that
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and and this is where
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is where through these
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
presentations what what I want to try to
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
do is is connect that gap between the
 
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
the traditional
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit name and then the
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
so go ahead
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
of course so if if you turn to page five
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
um what I've tried to do here is really
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
chunk out the various functions that
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
occur within accounting unit 5676
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
um on the far side
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
um think expenditures and and this is
 
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:45.500 align:start position:0%
where a vast majority of the FTE
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
work and and this is really the the
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
finance team and within
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
within the uh within our division we
 
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.069 align:start position:0%
within the uh within our division we
have

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um Finance directors in each Finance
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
director oversees a specific division
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
area so we have a finance director that
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
oversees uh the division of long-term
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
supports and services and the division
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
of economic stability we have a finance
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
director director that oversees the
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and families
 
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.140 align:start position:0%
and and and and so forth and so on
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
and um they're responsible for a variety
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
of functions on a day-to-day basis and
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
this includes our Surplus deficit
 
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:28.700 align:start position:0%
projections our AP management uh
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
Contracting invoices day-to-day account
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
management audit activities year
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
enclosed statutory reporting
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and and the list really continues
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
this is where a bulk of the financial
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
work this is where the where the
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
financial work really takes place we
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
also have a revenue and Reporting side
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
of the house as well one of the key
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
functions there is our CMS 64 report
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's a quarterly report
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
that that we provide to the federal to
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
to the federal government there's also
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the year over 200 various
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
reports are filed yes
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm looking at page 1072 and I'm
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
looking at uh kind of the middle of the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
page where it talks about numbers of
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
positions permanent classified
 
00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:19.579 align:start position:0%
unclassified total number of positions
 
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
and so I read 158 is is what is in the
 
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:26.300 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:29.899 align:start position:0%
do these numbers on page
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just doing a crosswalk make sure
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
give you some quick math here they they
 
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
give you some quick math here they they
should

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay so so this so This slide represents
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
uh the 24 25
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
request correct and then
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
um because and it's it's not a it's not
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
huge but this is a a gain of uh of maybe
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent and Manpower over the
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
so are you also able to highlight for us
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
on Slide Five what where where the
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
additions are going so the the rate
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
setting team came over to the division
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
of finance and procurement that was
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
previously within within the division of
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there are also a few
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
conversions of full-time temporary
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions that were converted to
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent positions
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
um the presentation that I've provided
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the slides I can't
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
remember which one we had a net
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
reduction across the department of of 20
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
positions total
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
okay so to summarize
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
um this is this isn't creeping
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy this is the movement of
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
functions and that you've actually taken
 
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:57.740 align:start position:0%
a scalpel to reducing some of the ftes
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
that that that's what's being
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
represented here on page five yes and
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
and so if if I can speak to slide five
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
just to kind of talk about what's
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
changed all right so so on the revenue
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
and Reporting they also one of their key
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
functions is the drawdown of federal
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
funds and then
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
um a another unique feature about HHS is
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have a public assistance cost
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
allocation plan and uh we have a few
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
folks that manage that and what that
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
represents is it's several hundred Page
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
Long document and it articulates to the
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
federal government the methodology that
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
we use to allocate federal funds so
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
there's random moment studies that we
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of for personnel that
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
are working on certain functions so that
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
we we can pay then have a certain Grant
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's random time studies
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
um as well there's a whole series of
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
methodologies in that team oversees that
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
the rate setting to your point uh is is
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
a function that we moved into finance
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
and and formalized previously
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
um there was a there was a function
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid team but what we
 
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.550 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid team but what we
discovered

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
discovered
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
was a real need to establish
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
standardized approaches across the
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
department for rate setting
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
methodologies because it's not just
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
within the division of Medicaid that
 
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
that applies so why why would that I'm
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to come to represent Waller in
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay the governor's asked for uh 3.1
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
percent in Medicaid is is is that what
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
this group of rate setting is meant to
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
do is to take a look at that 3.1 percent
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh and offer Alternatives
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
or what I I if if it's just implementing
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent across the board it doesn't
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
seem like you need five people for that
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
no um that the the organizational change
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
really had nothing to do with that at
 
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.810 align:start position:0%
really had nothing to do with that at
all

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
um on on a daily on a daily basis
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
whenever we have state plan Amendment
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
changes to the Medicaid Program or
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
waivers these are the individuals that
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
are deeply involved in that work
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll be talking about uh
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment providers and when
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
when Joe ribson from the division of
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
children youth and family comes and this
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
team has been deeply involved in looking
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
at the rates within the contracts as
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
um that that provision that we will
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
likely see within hb2 that was reference
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
by the governor really has nothing to do
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
with the organizational design of this
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
but they would certainly be involved in
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
any of that work okay representative
 
00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:36.069 align:start position:0%
any of that work okay representative
Wallner

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you get it closer to you if you
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
would mind yeah thank you
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
so this is um
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
I've seen the budget quite a few times
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
so over the years I think there's been a
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
different way of doing this and I
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
remember in the past
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
each division
 
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.769 align:start position:0%
each division
had

00:16:57.769 --> 00:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
a finance I don't know if it was called
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
a finance director or someone who was
 
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
did the finances
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think maybe in the last budget we
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
Consolidated to every all the division
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
Finance people being under this
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
group so so historically there was a
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
finance director that was tied directly
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
to the division directly and within the
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
program a number of years ago probably
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago it's it's been a
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
few biennia
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
um where we've centralized that that
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
Financial function
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and and part of that is I mean it's
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
really by intentional design so that we
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
can have consistent policies and
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
procedures consistent approaches across
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
the department because if we're working
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
in silos then then naturally we would
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
have different different outcomes
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that my question is so we moved from
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
them being attached to the divisions and
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
the work of those specific divisions to
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
now coming into a finance department
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
what is the word I mean how how do they
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
work with the division how do they what
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
kinds of day-to-day activity they're so
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
they're no longer we won't find Finance
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
people in each division's budget is that
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct so
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors are not supervising the
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
finance people
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
correct so how talk to me about how that
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
relationship Works sure so I I think
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
each each area I mean part of it just
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
depends upon the relationship that the
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
division director has with the financial
 
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:44.900 align:start position:0%
director but um most areas have regular
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
monthly update meetings which are
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
attended by Bureau Chiefs and the
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
financial directors
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
um we have monthly Contracting meetings
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
that are attended by the division
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
director and the financial team to make
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody is on the same page
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
there there's other regular update
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
meetings that that are attended by both
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
parties and then perhaps more
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
importantly just the necessities of
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
day-to-day work require that that those
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
two parties be connected on a regular
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
basis whenever we have a grant or a
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
grant evaluation process for new
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
competitive Awards
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
um you know that there's conversations
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
that are occurring so those those are
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing through a variety of various
 
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.130 align:start position:0%
ongoing through a variety of various
mediums

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
so do you think that this model
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
allows the people who work in the
 
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.890 align:start position:0%
allows the people who work in the
divisions

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
enough information I mean do they
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
understand enough about the budget that
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
their of the work they're directing
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
yes I I would certainly say so the with
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
the preparation of the subsequent
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
presentations that you're going to be
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
seeing in the coming weeks uh the
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
financial directors and the division
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
directors have been have been working
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
closely on the content of those
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm also uh rolling out a new
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
standardized initiative as well for
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
um monthly business meetings
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
um that that retired some time ago I
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
think as a result of the pandemic but
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
those are actually going to be starting
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
here in the coming weeks as well
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
so um one of the common questions I'm
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
going to be asking over and over I
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
should actually I guess it's at least a
 
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:30.380 align:start position:0%
couple is um uh what what is our vacancy
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
rate here and which of these areas are
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
going to be most affected by planned I.T
 
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.289 align:start position:0%
going to be most affected by planned I.T
upgrades

00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to buy productivity
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
with RIT upgrades and and I'd like to
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
know where we're going so it in in the
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides I'm going to be
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the I.T initiatives
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
that we have been working on that are
 
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.190 align:start position:0%
that we have been working on that are
supported

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
um roughly I haven't checked today but
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
last I checked we were hovering right
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
around 20 some odd percent to 20 so 20
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
point something a vacancy a vacancy in
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
this area we've been working hard and
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see in our challenges slide that
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
I have up ahead
 
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
um that is one of our bigger challenges
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
and and critical priorities from my
 
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.250 align:start position:0%
and and critical priorities from my
perspective

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay and when we get to the it it's
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to link back to here and tell me
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
which of these areas we're most likely
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
to get productivity gains so that in
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
next budget we can see some declines in
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
Manpower so so in my upcoming slides I
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
might actually show you how some it
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives have increased the
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in this area okay thank you
 
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.370 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in this area okay thank you
um

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
so on Slide Five we also have a
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
centralized Contracting function and
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative walner we also
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
historically this was also decentralized
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
on the department centralized the
 
00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:50.539 align:start position:0%
Contracting function
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
probably about eight nine years ago now
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
in order to standardize our Contracting
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
and any and gain efficiencies and I'm
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to demonstrate what those look
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
like and that group facilitates all the
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals requests for
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
applications requests for bids and and
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
other various solicitations contracts
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
and amendments and mousse and other
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
various agreements and then finally we
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
also have a grants management team this
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
team provides a lot of technical
 
00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:20.179 align:start position:0%
assistance across the department
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
as you know much of the many of the
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
dollars that we do receive are federal
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
funds uh Federal uniform guidance is a
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh it's due to CFR per 200 applies to
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
the use of almost all of our federal
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
funds and then every Federal grant that
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have also has additional final
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
requirements attached to that this
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
individual helps and assists provides
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and training both
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
internally and to our vendors as well to
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
help navigate many of the federal rules
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
and regulations which can be complex
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
um they also so with only two ftes there
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
I assume that you've got a
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
cross-training in place so that you have
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
a contingency in case you lose one or
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
two of these people
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
so Federal uniform guidance and and such
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
requirements are actually
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
um they're known by the finance
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
directors and many of the financial
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
managers as they they Implement and
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
execute those on a day-to-day basis so
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
this individual really acts as a key
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
repository of information and helps all
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
the other individuals across the
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
department interpret and and effectuate
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
those requirements so is that that's a
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes then
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes I do ask yes or no questions
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you that CFR citation yes
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
that first of all I'm going to ask you
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
what it was exactly so I can write it
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
down and then second of all that
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
regulates all federal funds received
 
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.830 align:start position:0%
regulates all federal funds received
from

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
two DHHS
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
Federal it's commonly referred to as
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
Federal uniform guidance
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
um there's a long history behind it I
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
won't go into it unless you really want
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
me to
 
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:09.860 align:start position:0%
um but essentially uh was it probably
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
six six seven years ago the federal
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
government they centralize all of their
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
standards before they had various
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
circulars out there that kind of
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
contradicted each other left some things
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
vague and so the central they centralize
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
all those requirements so that it would
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
uniformly apply to a vast majority of
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars that we do receive
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
and then through if we have a federal
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
award there may be some additional
 
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.260 align:start position:0%
requirements reporting requirements
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
allowability uses things of that nature
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
that would apply to that specific Grant
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
and and one key part there that this
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
individual helps oversee is a system for
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient monitoring
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
um that's that's uh to CFR 200 331
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and any any award that we make
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
um to in in organization or individual
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
where they are a sub-recipient as
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
defined within that section other
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's certain requirements that we
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
have to meet as far as managing and
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
oversight of those dollars
 
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:21.770 align:start position:0%
oversight of those dollars
so

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the grants management team also um
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
they they oversee the Department's uh
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
standardized system for evaluating
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
competitive grants to make sure that a
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
the grant is in alignment with um with a
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
department be there are adequate
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
resources both on the programmatic
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
revenue reporting Financial Contracting
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and and all other resources that
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
would be involved with the management of
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
that Grant so we try to really
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully before we go and apply for
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
something make sure that it aligns with
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
the mission and will will result in
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes so so my eyes have
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
drifted up on page 1072 to the revenue
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
lines where it's Federal in general and
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
most of this is General
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
so is there is there a matching
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
requirement at all in this in this money
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
or is this just that we happen to be
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
able to cost allocate to some federal
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
money and then we're supplementing with
 
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.269 align:start position:0%
money and then we're supplementing with
General

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
we are able to primarily cost allocate
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to turn to if you turn to
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
the the budget briefing book
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm on 1072. so so in front of you
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's the PowerPoint presentation and
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
then at the back of that is is the
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
and if you turn to page
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
two of that document the budget briefing
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
book includes all of our accounts that
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
are in excess of a million dollars
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
and what we've included there if you if
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
you scroll down about Midway you'll see
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
the funding source and
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we have listed all of the various
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay so to go back to my question I I
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
think what as I'm looking at the this
 
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
funding source segment
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
in the office of business operations
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
this this Revenue this is not matching
 
00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.130 align:start position:0%
this this Revenue this is not matching
money

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
it so it this is cost allocation that we
 
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
can apply to some general funds but sep
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
or excuse me federal funds but then we
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
have to supplement it with General funds
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
to ensure the thing can operate but
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no matching
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
requirement here
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.909 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
primarily no we do have
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
um one mou that's funded out of class
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
102 that has a matching requirement but
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
as if you're if you're talking about
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
personnel and other class lines well the
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
total budget I mean this is all agency
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
income to pay for
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
um this office of business operations
 
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
um this office of business operations
yes

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
um with the exception of one mou it's
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's cost allocated the one mou is is a
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
match without an exact number about how
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
how what's the value of that mou I
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's 350 000. so I'm sorry 350
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
000. 350. yeah
 
00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:49.850 align:start position:0%
000. 350. yeah
okay

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
turning to slide six
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and and this is uh speaking to your
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
your earlier question uh chairman
 
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.909 align:start position:0%
your earlier question uh chairman
Edwards

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.590 align:start position:0%
Edwards
um

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
these are some of the key key
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
accomplishments that the team has had
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
during the past during the current
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
biennium we are in the process of
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
implementing a budget business
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
intelligence tool
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
um historically and anyone that attends
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee has probably heard this
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
conversation historically we have had a
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
challenge projecting our Revenue
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
estimates this system will allow us to
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
do that it's also it should be live here
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of this week it
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
will also allow me to pretty easily
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with any questions
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
so last week representative walner you
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
had asked the question of where are TANF
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
funds budgeted
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
um this system will actually allow us in
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
a couple of clicks to create a visual
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
image and show every accounting unit and
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
the dollars attached to that area so
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
this is something that the team has been
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
working on diligently for a long time
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
now and we are about to see it come to
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
fruition the centralization of the rate
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
setting team I already spoke to that I
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
won't go into that too much
 
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.130 align:start position:0%
won't go into that too much
um

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
we we are also in the process on the
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
Contracting side and this really speaks
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
to that efficiency so if we spend money
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
on I.T so what what does it matter if
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're not getting anything out of it and
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of slides after this
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's going to show you some of the
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
benefits that we've had through some of
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
the various I.T improvements that we've
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
implemented on the Contracting side and
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
we are uh trying to finalize right now a
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
contract lifecycle management system for
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
the development of our contracts and
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
then we are also in the process of
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
migrating what has historically been an
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Excel based solution it's a database of
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
sorts I wouldn't call it a database
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
because it's not relational but it's an
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Excel file nonetheless into a web-based
 
00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:50.059 align:start position:0%
application to standardize streamline
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
allow transparency and better
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
information sharing and we have also
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
implemented uh uh in Safe physical year
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
22 a finance Academy and this team and
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
some are informally attached to we do
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
have one full-time person working on
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
this this team's standard is a actively
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
working to standardize our internal
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
processes and establish Dynamic training
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
so that they're recorded they're updated
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis so that we when we
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
have new staff come on board we're able
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
to teach them through an online series
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
of trainings this is how travel
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
reimbursements works this is how cost
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
allocation 101 works this is how you
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
should fill out a 170 form all of you
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
know just just the day-to-day to really
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
capture that information so that we can
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
start to plan for the future because if
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
you turn to the um if you turn oh wait a
 
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.090 align:start position:0%
you turn to the um if you turn oh wait a
minute

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.350 align:start position:0%
minute
because

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
we we do face within Finance we do have
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
a number of senior staff that that have
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
been here for quite some time and in the
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
next couple of years they will be able
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
to retire so what we're starting to do
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
is to try to plan for that that
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
retirement and that deep loss of
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge and standard that standardize
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
what they know into some of the systems
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
that we have so that there is not a
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
complete knowledge Gap when those when
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
those individuals do indiva retire here
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the coming years yes
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
so so by the way I think you're doing a
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
great job so if you're if you're nervous
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
or anything you don't look nervous but
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
just you're doing a great job okay
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
I this budget business intelligence tool
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
yes uh I I imagine because it's his
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
budget and the purpose you've stated
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
here that that is the total potential of
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
the scope of that intelligence tool
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
and and let me let me give you some
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
background on that because DHHS sits on
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of data and
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
companies are moving more and more to a
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
data warehouse concept where they can do
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
Data Mining and they use the phrase
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
business intelligence to to imply that
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
they can go data mine their entire data
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
warehouse and and I I just want to know
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this tool if this
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
tool is specifically for the financial
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
analysis or is it the vendor supported
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
tool that can do more
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
so it has yet to go live but it will be
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
going live soon
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
um my plan is to utilize this
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
right now anyway it both as far as
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
regular updates to the fiscal committee
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
when it comes to revenue reporting right
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
now we're able to project expenditure
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
labs and okay I'm not focused on the you
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
know within the finance area I'm not
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
talking about that I really only want to
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
know if if it's in if it's positioned to
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
where it will extend beyond have a scope
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
beyond the financial analysis
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
to be candid I haven't contemplated that
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine it's a it's a geek question
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we can we can skip it it's a great
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
question though
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
um I I I I mean we'll keep that in mind
 
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
as we move forward and enroll and roll
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
it out but I'm I'm not I don't yet know
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
to be candid okay uh well Mr wheaters
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
will be in here so hopefully I'll
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to slide seven
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I I had uh made reference to this in
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
one of our earlier presentations
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
we we centralize our Contracting
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
function and again this all falls within
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
56 accounting unit 5676
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
and over the past five years
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that team has been under an enormous
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
amount of organizational change where we
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
reorganized the the
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
um the bureau we reclassified our
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
positions to better we conducted an
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
analysis of every function that they
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
perform what are all of the products
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
what are the rfps the contracts you
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
supremacist agreements we dug really
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
deep and we conducted all of that
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
analysis and then we built that Excel
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
based system that I was just talking
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
about that we're now migrating to the
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
cloud to more of a web-based system we
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
also implemented DocuSign e-signature
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we basically rolled
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that out uh in in about two months
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
design and implementation and we took
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
what used to be a process that literally
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
involved us mailing a document them
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
signing it mailing it back somebody
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
driving it downtown at the AG's office
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
AG's office signing it bringing it back
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
we cut that down from days and weeks to
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
27 minutes as our record by implementing
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
that and so the contract life cycle
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
management piece
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
um that we that we are in the process of
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh designing and rolling out and testing
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
um that will basically streamline the
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
creation of contracts so that instead of
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
using an email based system you know
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
where you have three different versions
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the same file
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
um this will this will have standardized
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
templates you'll input key data it'll
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
pre-populate standard forms and then
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
there'll be a flow where I can send it
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
to this person it automatically gets
 
00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:12.859 align:start position:0%
moved on to this person
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
and and we're really excited about how
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
much faster we expect that to make the
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
the process go on on slide eight
 
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:26.540 align:start position:0%
um this is the total projects approved
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
during State fiscal years 2019 2022 by
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
the contracts unit you'll see in 2019
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
and 2020 we we had roughly the same
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
number 2021 was a bit of an anomaly uh
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
think of that as the pandemic years
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that was a really a really really
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
busy time where many of the standard
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
rules were actually removed and the need
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
to get contracts stood up for vaccine
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
sites and security at the sites and
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
um I won't go into it but long story
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
short think of that as an anomaly but
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
what you'll see within 2022 is some of
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
the efficiencies gained we are producing
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
and getting more items approved and
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
before GNC at a faster rate than we ever
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
have historically
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
and so that's really measuring total
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
contracts approved volume wise on slide
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
nine you'll see kind of the trend and
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
this is the average days for processing
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
time so back in 2018 it was taking about
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
142 days and this includes our rfps our
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
contracts our mousse amendments
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
everything in totality
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
um again 2021 was a bit of an anomaly so
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can kind of take that out but even
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
if you take 2021 out you'll still see
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
that downward Trend in efficiency so
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we've gone from 142 days down to 95
 
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.970 align:start position:0%
that we've gone from 142 days down to 95
days

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:42.980 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
our goal is to continue that Trend with
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
with the the implementation of contract
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
lifecycle management because as we've
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
already discussed we rely on many of our
 
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.810 align:start position:0%
already discussed we rely on many of our
contractors

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
before many of the services provided to
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
the state citizens and and this is a
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
this is a key vital function to make it
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
as efficient as possible
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think we have a couple questions here
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.589 align:start position:0%
I think we have a couple questions here
um

00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
do you do you would you also be able to
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
map on this I'm not I'm not asking you
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
to I'm asking if you were would be able
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
to map the total number of sole source
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
contracts or the percentage of sole
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
source contracts because so I I assume
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
social Source contracts take much less
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
processing time than the full
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
competitive route so my guess on 21 is
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
that we had a higher percentage of sole
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
source contracts so so yes or no do you
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
think you have the data that you could
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
map what the percentage of sole source
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
Contracting is we could we could
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
certainly map the percentage of new sole
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
source contracts if you talk about sole
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
source amendments that where the rules
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually changed over the past three
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
years twice so so that data would be a
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
little bit more meaningless so are the
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
amendments in in this graph though on
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
page nine yes that we've averaged
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
everything out into that figure all
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative walner
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
did you have a question yes thanks
 
00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:09.410 align:start position:0%
did you have a question yes thanks
so

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.069 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
in 21 I mean I see on page eight that
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
you did considerably
 
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.829 align:start position:0%
you did considerably
more

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
contracts I assume that was that arpa
 
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.450 align:start position:0%
contracts I assume that was that arpa
money

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.170 align:start position:0%
money
um

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
it was arpa money it was cares dollars
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
it was a variety of of the um of the
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
funds that we were receiving from the
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
federal government but that was
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
primarily uh the pandemic response
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's why that increases there so are
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
most of those contracts now been are we
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
almost to the end of most of those
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
contracts last I had checked a vast
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
majority of of those contracts and and
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
so if if you think back to that time to
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
have like a single vaccine site stood up
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
it was supported probably by seven or
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
eight contracts alone and and we had
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
those across we also had
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
um we had agreements with first
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
responder organizations across the state
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh both public and and non-profit as
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
well to provide Staffing you know so
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that was probably I don't know I
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
had probably 70 80 100 uh you know
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
agreements that we had in place there
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
and and it was really an anomaly of a
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
year yeah
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
I just so you anticipate dropping back
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
down in the numbers of contracts that
 
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
were negotiating back down to more
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know in the area of
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
800 instead of
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
looks like you were up to 1200.
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
I so the the the needs and demands and
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
and remember this also right this also
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
includes amendments but the speed of our
 
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.670 align:start position:0%
includes amendments but the speed of our
business

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
um historically I don't necessarily know
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether we'd been able to meet all of
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
that through amendments
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
um as quickly as we should have been and
 
00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:04.670 align:start position:0%
um as quickly as we should have been and
so

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily know if the past is
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
a good indicator of the future
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
um just depending on what does transpire
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know the you know whether there's a
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
hospital surge a new variant whatever it
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
might be or a homeless initiative or an
 
00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis all of these things can
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
can have a direct impact on the number
 
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
of amendments so if we have to amend the
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
agreements three times uh for some
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
reason in a year you know that'll really
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
bump that up 30 instead of instead of
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
just one or three
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you of course
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
so dipping back to page eight for just a
 
00:41:42.359 --> 00:41:43.190 align:start position:0%
so dipping back to page eight for just a
second

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:45.740 align:start position:0%
um I I can understand
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
this correlation between the activity
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
and the pro point in the budget cycle
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
that we're in uh I'm in again a yes or
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
no are you all looking to see if there's
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
potential that could be followed to
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
smooth this so that you don't get uh use
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
it or lose it uh scramble at the end of
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
the budget year
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
yes and I almost wish I included a slide
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
I normally include when I present on
 
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:14.060 align:start position:0%
Contracting um so back in 2018
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
as I described it we would have the
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
roller coaster effect where every April
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
May and June we would push through
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
hundreds of contracts and agreements and
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
so back on the prior slide where I was
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
talking about some of the initiatives
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the team had engaged in one of them
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
was an annual forecasting initiative
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
that was a very methodological approach
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
where we would provide every division
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
director this is your list of contracts
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
that are expiring in 10 11 months what's
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
the plan and um the the the current
 
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
director within contracts Robert Moore
 
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
he has since implemented a recurring
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
um future procurement kind of initiative
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
where we're having regular feedback to
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
avoid that kind of spiraling effect
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
where everything comes due and so I
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
actually have charts where instead of
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
seeing this we start to see that kind of
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
smoothing number to to get to that more
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
consistent reliable regular uh
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
production quote-unquote production
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
environment if you would take an
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
industrial approach to it that that
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
should be occurring
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
um but it's taken years and a tremendous
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
amount of work to get there
 
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:32.329 align:start position:0%
amount of work to get there
yep

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
so finally
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
um on on pay on page 10 some of our key
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
challenges this will come as no surprise
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
given our past conversation
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
um we do sometimes have challenges for
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
for our entry level positions on the
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
finance side
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
um where the salaries aren't sufficient
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
to attract and and or retain staff
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
experience is difficult for some of our
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
mid to senior level positions finding
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
the right experience
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
um is is a challenge as I already noted
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
earlier we do have some retirements that
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
are on the horizon some of our key
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
financial director positions could
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
become vacant here in the coming years
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and then you know just just from a
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
organizational perspective and um I I
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
was involved with much of the work on
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
the contract side I like to Tinker and
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
reorganize things to meet the business
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
need and and that can sometimes be a
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
challenge uh within the classification
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
system that we have so so the governor's
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
proposing a 10 across the board pay
 
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
raise is is that going to uh ameliorate
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
these issues or are you still needing
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
something else to address some of these
 
00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:45.710 align:start position:0%
something else to address some of these
concerns

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have any data to support this
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
but my hunch would be that 10 10 percent
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the first year two percent in the
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
second year would certainly get us to a
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
place a lot closer to where we need to
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
be representative hole and then
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative verf and then
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
use the word tinker I like that
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
um the engineering meets coming up so
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about in terms of quality
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
of employee versus efficiency in Broad
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
terms is there a sweet spot where less
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
staff that are better
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
is a more effective team in some of
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
these and when I'm looking at entry
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
level and mid senior level positions
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
right how do we get to that Paradigm if
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think there are certain positions
 
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.210 align:start position:0%
I think there are certain positions
um

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
that that where you just you need you
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
need a person
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm gonna have to think about
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great question I I don't
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
think that I've performed you know the
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
qualitative and quantitative analysis
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
necessary to really give you a a an
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
answer I can rely on I think I'd really
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
need to take that one back and think
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
about that harder
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
there are certain positions right entry
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
level positions is it right whether it's
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
handling processing processing of forms
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
those things that are that are far more
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
right straight labor content but the
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
management team directly above that that
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
first level makes a huge difference to
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
how effective that group is and that's
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
where I'm trying to focus right that
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
first year of managers can be either
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
very effective at running their team or
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
not so effective and I think
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
my impression is right these are still
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
hourly employees and
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
we might be able to do better so if
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
there's room for improvement please let
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
us know
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
um one of the challenges that we have is
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
be given the workloads that we have many
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
of many of our our managers or even our
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
finance directors
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and and I think this you'll probably
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
hear some of this from other division
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
directors you know we're sometimes
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
because we are short 20 staff that work
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
still has to be completed and that has
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
to be picked up
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
um by you know class class specs that
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
that maybe should otherwise be doing
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
other higher level work or future
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
planning things of that nature
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
um to really try to get out of that you
 
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
know I I don't want to call it a
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
reactive cycle but but I but I I think
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm I'm speaking to
 
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:33.890 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm I'm speaking to
um

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
I mean I I can I can certainly take that
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
back and consider but but I think right
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.109 align:start position:0%
back and consider but but I think right
now

00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
um we the the the finance team is really
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
straight out
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
um frankly
 
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.630 align:start position:0%
um frankly
representative

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair regarding your uh at
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
your level bullet point would it be more
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
efficient to Target uh increases in pay
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
to the areas where they're for instance
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here most um
 
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.569 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here most um
needed

00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
so I know the department of personnel
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if they've presented
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
have they presented to house Finance on
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
the standard occupancy code overhaul
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
that they're working on
 
00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.210 align:start position:0%
that they're working on
okay

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't know if if it would
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to have the Department
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
administrative Services kind of speak to
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
the work that that they have been doing
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so they have been looking at the I
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how many it is 972
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
classifications and and just for
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
everyone's understanding
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
um every job in the state has a has a
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
classification so there's a program
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
specialist one a program specialist two
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
a program specialist for and then
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's various
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
um job you know kind of skills that are
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
required for each of those and then
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
those CL then those classifications are
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
tied to a labor grade and so there could
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
be 50 you know classifications that are
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
at labor grade 25 I I don't know I'm
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
just kind of pulling that off the top of
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
my head but would they have been working
 
00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:07.339 align:start position:0%
on is concurrently
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
what they have been working on is taking
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
those 975 or whatever they are and
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
putting those into standard occupancy
 
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.290 align:start position:0%
putting those into standard occupancy
codes

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
which which I believe are issued by the
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor and statistics which
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
will cut that down I think roughly 170
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that so that that but
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't know all of the details but I
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
know that that effort is is being
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
undertaken to try to simplify the system
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
and get to some of what you're speaking
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
to representative Earth so I I don't
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
know if it'd be best to have the
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services speak
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
to that initiative
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
um but so let me let me ask you that
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
question we have some work sessions open
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
to us those for scheduling in in March I
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
think is this a topic that you would
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
like to have Das come in and and brief
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
specifically on what they've done on on
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
relooking Personnel classifications
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
if it's relevant to
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
the discussion about increasing salaries
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
across the board relative or not or
 
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
doing something more targeted such as
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
seems to be implied in this in this
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
bullet point sure I yeah it seems to me
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
like kind of obvious if we're going to
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
try to Target we need to talk to das and
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
ask them what what we already know so so
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple what do you think can we can
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
we schedule them to come in in March
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
I can schedule that
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
um would you want them to come in just
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
to division three or should we do you
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
think we should try for a full committee
 
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.690 align:start position:0%
think we should try for a full committee
meeting

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
let's start with the division three and
 
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
invite and if we get interest you know
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
we'll let uh full Finance adopt it but
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
but we have so many of these kinds of
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
things in division three that we may be
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
able to keep them busy for an hour sure
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up either
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
representative Hull or or Earth okay
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
then representative walner
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so I've been trying to really
 
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:06.980 align:start position:0%
understand the 10
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
increase that was in the governor's
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
budget for um wages and salaries so
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 if if you have an entry-level job
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
that is empty right now
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
if you could find Once the 10 goes in
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
once you could find someone to fill that
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
position they would have gotten the 10
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
because the the uh wages would have all
 
00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:33.740 align:start position:0%
gone up 10 percent
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
I have not seen the hb2 provision yet
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is yes that that
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
would go ahead and apply to those
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
positions I believe as it's going to be
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
effective is July 1. okay so even
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
positions that are not filled now will
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
still have built into them a ten percent
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
wage okay that's my understanding thank
 
00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.870 align:start position:0%
wage okay that's my understanding thank
you

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
another shot at it sure apparently I
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
need more coffee
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so on this 10 and representative erf
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
was kind of heading there right it's
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
applied uniformly across all personnel
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
with little discretion to management on
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
other than maybe step increases or
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
position changes in terms of helping
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
motivate incentivize the key players
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
what can we do as a committee to help
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
right make sure right upper management
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
within the HHS
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
can retain and grow the key players that
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
are doing the getting the work done that
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
so I I mean I think we're really we're
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
really getting to that Statewide policy
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussion here
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I think every you know every
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
department is going to have a different
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
perspective I I just want to be
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
I just want to be sensitive to to the
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide policy because it's not only
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's not only impacting DHHS I mean we
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a classified system
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel has
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
um you know oversight over that
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I know that you know there's there's
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
a collective bargaining agreement that
 
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
has to be taken into consideration as
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
well so I I think it would be difficult
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
to make any sort of
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
broad broad policy statements on on my
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
part just just to keep in mind kind of
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
like separation of powers like executive
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
branch versus
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
um versus legislative branch setting the
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
policy that I I think that's just my my
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
so Mr Ripple that answer just made me
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
rethink my earlier answer and we should
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead and Tee It Up for full Finance
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'll see if I can schedule that all
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
time check uh how much time did we think
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
we needed or you needed for this and
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
because it's probably already taken
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
longer than you anticipated I I think
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
we're doing okay
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
um we we have uh licensing regulatory
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
Services up next if we're if we're ready
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
to move on
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
or I don't want to rush you though I
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
mean I have been rushing you but oh they
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
are right next so that's a good segment
 
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.609 align:start position:0%
are right next so that's a good segment
segue

00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.619 --> 00:54:15.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
God I love this
 
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
you guys are so squared away with the
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
hi there good morning Melissa Saints
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
here I'm the chief legal officer for the
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
department and I oversee the office of
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
legal and Regulatory services so I'm
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to be here with you for your net
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
for our kind of next two chunks so the
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
first chunk being licensing Licensing
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory Services which includes
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
both child care licensing and health
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to be telling us how this
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
relates to what oplc does and what the
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
distinctions are between yeah absolutely
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
happy to do so so
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
um you'll see on the first page the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
first slide which is slide 11 that we
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
have three accounting units activity
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
accounting units for this child care
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
licensing being one health facility
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
Administration being one and Community
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
residences so we'll go we'll take those
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
one at a time
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
so child care licensing ensures all
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
center-based family based and and also
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
residential based child care centers are
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state so it's a it's a
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
health and safety regulatory oversight
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
of those of those centers we have New
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute we have administrative
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
Rule and there is also a federal
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
component related to criminal background
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
checks and other things that are
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
involved in licensing child care
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
licensing we also oversee which is new
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
to the department for the last two years
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh recreational camps so basically use
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
summer camps that was something that the
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services had
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
before and now it's with the Department
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Under child
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
care licensing
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities Administration is our
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
other component and health facilities so
 
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's two components under that
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification so
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
certification really has to do with
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
certifying for payment although it's
 
00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:16.339 align:start position:0%
regulatory in nature we're looking at
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare Medicaid services
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
basically their regulations and we're
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they're in compliance with
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
those regulations so that they can
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
receive medicare and medicaid funding so
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
although we don't actually look at
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
anything related to money at these
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
buildings we look at health and safety
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have to qualify they have to be on
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
they have to they have to be in
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
compliance with those regulations to be
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
able to receive that funding and if they
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
do receive that funding then they can
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
get licensed or if they do receive that
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
certification excuse me then they can
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
get licensed there are other health
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
facilities though that are also licensed
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
outside of certification assisted living
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
facilities for example Adult Day Care
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
Centers those centers don't take
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services they
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
don't they are usually private pay only
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
and in those situations they only fall
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
under state regulations and state laws
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
because they're only receiving State
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
funding they're not getting Medicare
 
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
and so that's the difference between
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification and we have
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
one other and I and I can answer your
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
question one second we have one other
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
certification which is our community
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
residences so people that have
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities or um or
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
acquire brain disorders live in
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
community residences so basically
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
residents in the community that
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
um they are cared for and we certify
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
those residents that they are in
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
compliance with regulatory with health
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
and safety standards so that they can
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
receive payment from our GD
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
um funding to to or ABD funding to get
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh to get that funding so they have to
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
be obviously in compliance with with our
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
certification standards so those are our
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
those are kind of our buckets if that
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
so I I skimmed ahead on your slide deck
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
and and of course and I I missed it if
 
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
it's in here uh on your child care
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
licensing yes this is uh the
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
availability of child care in general is
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
being mentioned as a Workforce issue
 
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
that there's not enough Child Care
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
availability is there anything about
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
what's going in and going on in the
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
child care licensing area that is a
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
roadblock or another contributing factor
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
to the challenges of making sure we have
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
enough child care providers in the state
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
so our child development Bureau is
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
really responsible for the development
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
of child care in in New Hampshire and
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's under long-term supports and
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
Services I believe right long-term
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
economics economic housing stability
 
00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:48.299 align:start position:0%
sorry wrong wrong
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
um division so they deal with kind of
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
the development of child care and making
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
sure that there's enough funding and
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
those type of things for for them to
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
sustain our regulatory arm is is the
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of safety in in health components
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
to caring for somebody in child care so
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
when we create our rules our state
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory licensing rules we always
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
engage our stakeholders fully to make
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we are not being overburdened
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome but also being
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
protective of the children that are
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
within their care so that's something
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
that we do and we engage with our
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
providers all of the time if there's
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
um barriers or roadblocks or things that
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
they think that from a regulatory
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
perspective that we have to look at we
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
will analyze and see if there is a way
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
for us to kind of lessen those
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
regulations there is a federal component
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
um all child care centers in the state
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire have to comply with our
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal record check component
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
which is a federal requirement so we
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
just execute that we don't have any say
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
into kind of what goes into that and I
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
know that that's one kind of bigger
 
00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
barrier that they feel like that process
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
is overly burdensome because to work in
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
a child care center you have to get an
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
FBI check and you have to get a
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting and you have to go
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
through a dcaf registry check and if
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
you've lived in another state within the
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
last five years you have to get ready
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
checks registry checks and criminal
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
background checks from that area as well
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
so that process is is over involved and
 
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we don't really
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
have a way to change it although we've
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
advocated with the federal government we
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
don't have a way to change it so that I
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
think is one of the kind of bigger
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
issues when it comes to onboarding staff
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
at a child care center so that strikes
 
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
me as an area we where most parents
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to cut back anyways right
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
I mean you want to make sure that the
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
people interacting with your kids are
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
are absolutely criminals right
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely and we have streamlined the
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
process really well to ensure that you
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
know what what happens is they are able
 
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
to onboard as long as they get their
 
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and their federal
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
background check in and then the other
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
the other components of the process can
 
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.730 align:start position:0%
the other components of the process can
be

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
um it can take longer and so we have 45
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
days to comply with the rest of it so
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
what we've done internally to ensure
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
that they're getting onboarded as soon
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
as possible is that we've worked very
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
closely the department of safety to
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
ensure that the fingerprints and all
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
those results get to us really quickly
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're able to turn it around right now
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
within about 48 hours which is which is
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
very helpful so it's not it's not a
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
burden but it is a lot of work for the
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
child care center representative Wallner
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
did you have a question here well I was
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
just going to ask about the background
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
checks because I think that's been one
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
of the real real problems in the last
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
year at least in in child care is
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
waiting on these background checks
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and so you think now you've gotten it
 
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
down I mean people were waiting weeks
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
months and sometimes for them to come
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
back yeah and I think some of it was
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
just education
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
um we've always been people have always
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
been able to be onboarded as soon as
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
their Federal check was done but they
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
weren't always you know getting the
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork or or Expediting that Pro that
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
part of the process right and so
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that that's something hey
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
if you do this really quickly and you
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
get this done now we can we can make
 
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
sure you're eligible right away then
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
there's that 45-day component where we
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
have to do all the other checks the
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
registry checks out of state stuff
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
um so people didn't understand I think
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
that they could be onboarded prior to
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and that they could they have to
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
work under supervision while they're
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
still waiting for the rest of that to be
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
done but I think that there was a just a
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
lot of communication logic education
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
that needed to happen and so that that
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
has been going really really well so for
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
a while you were doing waivers I believe
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
yes and you stopped doing the waivers
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
maybe in December yes we were we were
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
told by the federal government that
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
waivers were not allowed we can't waive
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
federal law so unfortunately we were not
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
able to do that any longer and since I
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
mean I know that many child care
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
providers were really
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
very concerned at that point yeah
 
01:02:49.319 --> 01:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
very concerned at that point yeah
because

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
um even though I do think they did
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
understand how to do the paperwork
 
01:02:55.319 --> 01:02:56.690 align:start position:0%
understand how to do the paperwork
um

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think there was a real concern about
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
how long it was going to take if with
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
that without getting those waivers I
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
mean the waivers had been good because
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
they had let people let people start
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
right work as soon as they got the
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
fingerprints but so now you're saying
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
you can do them within 48 Hours yeah and
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
we always have I think people under
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
thought that the waiver was something
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
that they needed for the entirety of
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
their um the 45-day period that they
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
were receiving the waivers for that
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
entire period they really weren't their
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
waiver was just for that short 48-hour
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
period while we were waiting for the the
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
fingerprint check to come in so once
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
people understood that and that we were
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we were able to actually get them
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
that information and get them their
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
clearance by that time that that has
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
helped a lot I think with um just you
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
know onboarding and making sure that
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
people can get into these Child Care
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
Centers ASAP okay thank you you're
 
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.650 align:start position:0%
Centers ASAP okay thank you you're
welcome

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you chairman
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
how much on this federal background
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
check is being done through federal
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
agencies versus the New Hampshire gun
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
line it's all done through New Hampshire
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
it has to be done through the department
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
of safety and uh so they do all of the
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
federal check and then we do just the
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
out-of-state kind of stuff and the dcy I
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
have to registry check
 
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.069 align:start position:0%
have to registry check
so

01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
um is this would all go through division
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
one I assume right in terms of making
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
sure that the appropriate Staffing is
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
there to handle yes Department of Safety
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
isn't working very hard on making sure
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
that this is done in a timely way from
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so moving on from Health Facilities
 
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification I explained
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
the differences between between those
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then also Community residences there
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
is one other thing that I just want to
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
note and that has to do with life safety
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
which is on page 14 of the slide deck
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
our life safety and health facilities
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation staff were
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
all located within the Department of
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and they have
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
been for
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
25 years probably we have to have life
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
safety inspectors and essentially those
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
individuals are not only required for
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
through CMS certification but also
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
required through licensing that we are
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing the environment we're
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
reviewing fire safety making sure that
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
you know sprinkler checks are happening
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
and fire drills are happening and
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people are in their
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
environment are safe and what we also
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
did though which was a little bit
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
outside of I think the scope of DHHS is
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
working on construction plans for new
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities so you'll see um I
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's an hp2 that we are going to
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
be moving our health facilities
 
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:38.540 align:start position:0%
construction plans reviewer position
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
over to the Fire Marshal's office right
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
now we have to work with the Fire
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
Marshal's office if we ever see anything
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's kind of askew or something that
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
requires a waiver we have to get that
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
approval from the Fire Marshals office
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
anyways and so now taking this kind of
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities construction plans
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
review positions and putting them over
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
at the Fire Marshal's Office that will
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
streamline the process have the you know
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to open a new
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare Facility have that go
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
um Fire Marshal's Office get the waivers
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
get the approvals that they need and
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
then we then pick up once they're
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
licensed we pick up the review of the
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
fire drills and the in the sprinkler
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
systems and all of those kind of Life
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
Safety components is is is there is
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
there any potential in these
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
certifications to rely more heavily on
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
self-certification with a less frequent
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
State periodic check and we could slap
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
some major criminal penalties for a
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
false self-certification is there have
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
you guys thought about that so we're not
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
able to do that for much of our
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
certification we're required through
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
certification to ensure CMS and those
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare Medicaid services
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow us to not comply with all
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
of those regulatory components and and
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
part of that is the um the the annual
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
checks and and those type of things we
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
have attempted through our recovery
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
housing which is not under this but it
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
is something that's in under the
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
department to do a self-certification
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
and at this point it's something that we
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
have this is kind of the first time
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
we've tried that so we're we're going to
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
have to see how that goes and and
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments because there is a
 
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
fine line between kind of recovery
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
housing and then substance use treatment
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
centers which are residential in nature
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
and they would actually be licensed so
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's these two components right now
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
and we're we're moving through that
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
process to see how that looks
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sure that within all of
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
these documents that are being provided
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
I could find this information but I
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
wondered how many facilities in each of
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
these categories are you
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.089 --> 01:08:10.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
page 22.
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
um this has a lot of information on the
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
legal Bureau and all the other units
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I haven't discussed yet but the
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
very first one you'll see child care
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
licensing right now there's 726 family
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
and Center based 23 residential programs
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
and 18 license exam facilities uh
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
serving over four forty six thousand
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
seven hundred children and then we have
 
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
um also the number of expected youth
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
recreational camps and then for health
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
facilities 967 facilities
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and it tells you how many pro concern
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
complaints we've processed and then how
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
many certified homes there are and those
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
are the community residence homes
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's pretty much it
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's your information great thank you
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
yep you're welcome
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
um do you want are you going to talk to
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
us about your vacancy rates and if any
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
of these areas can be streamlined made
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
more productive with automation
 
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.010 align:start position:0%
more productive with automation
certainly

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I can I was planning to say that at
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
the end but I can go over now for health
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
facilities and child care licensing if
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to throw you too far off
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
okay prepared remarks great
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I if everyone's comfortable I can
 
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:29.660 align:start position:0%
move on to the Bureau of Legal Services
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
so there's many components to Legal
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
Services as you can see in the counting
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
units on on page slide deck 15.
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
we have general counsel under general
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
counsel there's lots of different
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
components not just general counsel we
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
have office of the operation support
 
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.610 align:start position:0%
have office of the operation support
Administration

01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what what the
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
separation is between those two
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have two ombudsman's offices uh oh
 
01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.070 align:start position:0%
we have two ombudsman's offices uh oh
yes

01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.850 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:09:58.850 --> 01:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
we have two ombudsman's offices and we
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
have an administrative Appeals Unit as
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
well and legislative services so they
 
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
that kind of all they are all in one of
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
so as you can see on slide 16 general
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
counsel this is a very very high level
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
overview we have obviously a lot of
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
litigation within the department so we
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
have we represent the department in
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
court we represent the apartment
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
administrative forums related to
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh you know any kind of
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
administrative appeals Hospital
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
commitments guardianships pursuing debt
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
owed to the state and and and and more
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
and general counsel does a lot of
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
advising so similar to how Finance is
 
01:10:47.169 --> 01:10:47.179 align:start position:0%
structured we have a general counsel
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
Bureau that is dedicated to each of the
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department and some
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
of them cover multiple divisions some of
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
them uh you know kind of tag team
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
certain divisions because if we have
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
multiple Court hearings on a day one's
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
you know heading out to New Hampshire
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
hospital to do a an appeal there and
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
another one might have something to do
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere at the courts a guardianship
 
01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:16.460 align:start position:0%
or whatnot and so we we really
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
cross-train and make sure that we can
 
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.890 align:start position:0%
cross-train and make sure that we can
efficiently

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
um cover all of the all of the things
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to cover within that day so
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
we have even though they're they are
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
dedicated we do have a lot of cross
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
training that goes on and a lot of
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
people that help in different areas so
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things here obviously
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
um auditing uh advising on internal and
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
external audits responding to lawsuits
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance policies state laws
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and rules investigating Personnel
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
concerns responding to right to no
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
requests which are a huge part
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately of the work that we do
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and procurement obviously
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
advising on those type of things HIPAA
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
compliance promulgating administrative
 
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
rules and that's just some of what we
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
what the legal department does sure sure
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking at at page 15. I'm seeing
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
a couple of them but some lines yes but
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing a slide writing up what
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
they do yes we'll get there that's
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually um further in the slides okay
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
yep I I guess I stopped when I saw the
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
pdab sorry yeah it's on um
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
the two ombudsman's offices
 
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.070 align:start position:0%
the two ombudsman's offices
okay

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick clarification of
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
course are any of the are you is the
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
general counsel office handling the uh
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
sununu Center lawsuit situation or is
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
that removed so it's removed to an
 
01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.530 align:start position:0%
that removed so it's removed to an
extent

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General's office
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
represents the department in litigation
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
matters so if the the department is sued
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
um that the Attorney General's office
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
represents the department however
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
there's lots of Discovery so if there
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
are documents and things like that that
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
so those are kind of poured through at
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
the department by the program staff and
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
legal to ensure that we're providing
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're responsive to the Discovery
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
requests and and providing the
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate information okay thank you
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
very much you're welcome
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
so as I understand the sununu if you're
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
if if you're a victim you have two doors
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
you can walk through you can walk
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
through the the fast more efficient
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
route of going through the settlement
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
fund or you could decide that doesn't
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
work for you and you can go do a
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
full-blown lawsuit
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's my understanding that if they
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
go through the settlement fund it's it's
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
much less time and paperwork and effort
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
for everyone involved than in a
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
full-blown lawsuit
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
so the there is a actual entity that's
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
not affiliated with DHHS that has been
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
designated for handling with handling
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
the settlement fund and then there's the
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who's handling
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
the litigation side of things so if
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
people are doing the lawsuit so I ca so
 
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:09.500 align:start position:0%
although from a department perspective
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
our our responsibility is gathering the
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
information ensuring that we're being
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
um responsive to the Discovery requests
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
and assisting with those type of things
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
the time and the processing all happens
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
outside of the department so I can't
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
really speak to to your question
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I just wanted to point out
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
that there's still two different ways
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
great so the um as part of also the
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Legal Services we have two
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
kind of offshoot units child support and
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
and dcyf Council child support is
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for establishing paternity
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
and establishment enforcement of child
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
support and medical support borders so
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
we have a a lot of attorneys who
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
represent the the state essentially in
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
these matters and ensuring that
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
individuals are getting their child
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
support and that we're we're also
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
enforcing those if if anyone is not
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
compliant with the child with the child
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
support order
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then we provide general counsel as
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
well that that unit provides general
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
counsel to the office of Child Support
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
Program which is through
 
01:15:20.699 --> 01:15:21.530 align:start position:0%
Program which is through
um

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
through the economic and housing
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
disability division as well
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
and then dcif council is uh representing
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
the department and protecting the safety
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
and well-being of children
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and that is administratively attached
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
to the department so we help them with
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
um kind of the administrative needs but
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
their direction is taken through by the
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so we're
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
related but we're not it's kind of a
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
dotted line to to the department but
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think representative Mooney you have a
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:04.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here uh regarding
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
caseloads what is the average case count
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
per employee of your division that's
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
number one and number two is overtime
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that and I can imagine
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
what big firm life is like and dealing
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
with these cases and these very critical
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
and important matters uh how would you
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
describe over time for your department
 
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
so that everything is done efficiently
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
and as well thoroughly thank you
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
sure so on on slide deck 22 you can see
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
our case loads vary
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
um based off of what exactly we handle
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
so you'll see there's a general counsel
 
01:16:45.719 --> 01:16:46.610 align:start position:0%
so you'll see there's a general counsel
tab

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
tab
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
general counsel that we we broke some of
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
that down right to no requests 350 or so
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
a year our estate recoveries annually
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
recovers about 6.4 million a year that
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
is placing liens and going to court and
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get some of our money back for
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
to recover some of that client Legal
 
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:10.219 align:start position:0%
Services is a is a office that's
 
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
identified and created through statute
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
that receives complaints for those in
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
the disability developmental disability
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
program and and other things in the
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
department so they take about 63
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
complaints human resource complaints
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
you'll see AAU approximately 150 we
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
promulgate about 80 rules every year 320
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
probate commitments 75 guardianships and
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
then if you just take General client
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
Council matters other than kind of the
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
day-to-day stuff General client Council
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
matters about 300 or so that need a
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
legal memo or need you know some type of
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
document some type of an out legal
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
analysis that requires a production and
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
then dcyf we have 8 000 hearings roughly
 
01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
and about 10 000 open investigations at
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
the this time child support we average
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
about 220 hearings a month and HIPAA we
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
have a roughly about 160 incidences that
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
we have to investigate and log and
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're you know doing all of
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
the investigatory work that we need to
 
01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.689 align:start position:0%
the investigatory work that we need to
do

01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
as for your question related to how the
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
department has progressed I think that
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen an uptick in in complaints
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
and other things that we have to have to
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
investigate obviously you know Federal
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
Law changes state law changes all of
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
those things impact the department and
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
impact every Bureau that we deal with so
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine over the last three
 
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
years there's been a significant shift
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
in the way that we operate and the way
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
that we have been able to do things and
 
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
it and now we're doing we even have like
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
the unwind which we're unwinding
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that impacts the department
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
so there's always new things that come
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
up and I think that although we've
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
remained fairly steady we have seen a
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
general uptick in all of these things
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
including you know responding to write
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
to no requests and the the breadth of
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
those right to know requests and the
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
amount of documents we have to gather
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
and ensure we're in compliance with the
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
request so
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
um you know it's been it is although the
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
legal unit has not a significant vacancy
 
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
rate right now it is and I I'm speaking
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
just for general counsel dcif is a
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
totally different story but for general
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
counsel we haven't seen a huge vacancy
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
rate we still are
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
um very very busy everyone is working
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
many many hours so it's been it is a
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
challenge but but they're a great group
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I can imagine the
 
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:47.060 align:start position:0%
workload so I'm looking at page 1079
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
specifically item uh 018 the overtime
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
there variances any sort of an
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
explanation with regards to that in
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
relation to the answer that was just
 
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:03.649 align:start position:0%
relation to the answer that was just
given

01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
so that is Health Facilities
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
Administration over time
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
that you're asking about
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry am I in the wrong okay I meant
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
to look at that at legal and Regulatory
 
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.610 align:start position:0%
to look at that at legal and Regulatory
services

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you go
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
um write down it's 5146 so that this is
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
specifically to health facilities
 
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
Administration which is part of the
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay then for the overtime in your
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
office then is line
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:50.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry your question uh okay
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's more consistent than with what
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
you're talking thank you very much of
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
course and and I think one important
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
thing to point out there
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
um that with it within that
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit you do have your
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
classified in your class 10 and then you
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
have your unclassified positions in
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
class 12 and and they don't receive
 
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.410 align:start position:0%
class 12 and and they don't receive
overtime

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and another another thing that you
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily see here as well in
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
certain areas that don't budget over
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
time they provide them comp time so that
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
you work you know you work five extra
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
hours that week at some point six months
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
down the road you can take those or
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
maybe not six months but hypothetically
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
you take five hours off so that it's an
 
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount of time off instead of
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
receiving compensation
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Earth
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first I want to say
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
the relationship between your slides and
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
the briefing book and the in the budget
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
is phenomenal it's really great to have
 
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
it all tied together like this so
 
01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:50.219 align:start position:0%
regarding uh 5683 in the budget book
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
page 18 the financial summary talks
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
about case loads
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and in particular cost per case and I
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
note that in the in your request the
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
cost per case is you know sort of
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what it is during this
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
current biennium but in the governor's
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
budget it jumps up a fair bit to 927 956
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
dollars per case is there any idea why
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
pop that up I I apologize could you
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
clarify which page you're on page 18 of
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and this is a great thing this
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
piece of information
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure so I I mean I can speak generally
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
to what we're seeing at the department
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's this these the cases that we've
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
been dealing with have been significant
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
as you know the the YDC case is one of
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
those that you um that has already been
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned today we have three other kind
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
of very big lawsuits right now that are
 
01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:49.370 align:start position:0%
of very big lawsuits right now that are
um

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
that are impacting the amount of
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
discovery that we're required to do as
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
well as
um

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
the uh just overall how how much time
 
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:02.420 align:start position:0%
and money and energy we have to put into
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
responding to these these matters we do
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
have also from the AAU we have five
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
temporary positions that we've added and
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
those temporary positions I was I can
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
get to later but they are part of the
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unwind so our Medicaid unwind
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
requires that you know when we unwind
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
and take people off of benefits that
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
they have the right to an appeal and to
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
handle the the amount of appeals that
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
were expected we created Five temporary
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
part-time positions that will likely
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
span this entire this entire year and
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
maybe into early next year so that we
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
can handle the appeals in a timely way
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so those five positions are in this
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
line item so basically may I continue
 
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
so basically between the time you put
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the agency request in and the governor's
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
budget these new things correct became
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm sitting here thinking through an
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
earlier statement that we're seeing case
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
loads uh increase on
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
um in dcyf and right to know complaints
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the like
 
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:14.780 align:start position:0%
and and I'm trying to understand
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh what the cost of factors might be and
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
so do we have a more sensitive Community
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's knowing more about how to file a
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
complaint do we have uh worsening and
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
services that are triggering more
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
complaints are we are we keeping track
 
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
of historical Trends on the percentages
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
of cases or complaints that we that we
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
find to be valid versus you know not
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
valid uh in the at the end of the day
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
because because internally I would think
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that's sort of a trend line would
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
be a a nice warning sign to management
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
that maybe something's wrong and and so
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's all one question if you can
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how to answer sure of course
 
01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
so we did see a significant uptick
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
related to the covid pandemic
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the right to no requests from a whole
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
host of people and those right to know
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
requests can come from
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you know clearinghouses people that
 
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
are trying to just get information so
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
that they can put it on their website
 
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
right and we have the ability we we have
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to to provide
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
information so we saw we still see a
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
large number related to the pandemic and
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
getting numbers from the department and
 
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're very broad they just
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
kind of say give us everything you have
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
and so we have to go back to them and
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
limit them in scope and take some time
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
to do that so yes I definitely think
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's an uptick
 
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:49.340 align:start position:0%
um from the pandemic
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
we just over the last year and a half or
 
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
so have implemented legal files at our
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
department so we didn't actually have a
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
file management system from a legal
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
perspective until that time and so in
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
implementing that we have been able to
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
in real time kind of get this
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
information log these com you know
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's a complaint whether it's a
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
right to know request or whatnot get
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
them into the system and track and Trend
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a ton of historical data
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
other than kind of on paper things that
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
we used to use on Excel spreadsheets or
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
whatever and we're we're able to run
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
reports now that we weren't before so I
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
think some of that is our efficiency and
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
helping with us you know understanding
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
those and hopefully in the future we'll
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
have more information to be able to
 
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.570 align:start position:0%
have more information to be able to
provide

01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
um but you know everything that I know
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
is anecdotal at this point
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I assume that analysis and that
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
those um that that information would not
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
be subject to right to know correct okay
 
01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.010 align:start position:0%
be subject to right to know correct okay
um

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
I had another question but
 
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative do you have no
 
01:26:58.689 --> 01:26:58.699 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll come back to it
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
I just remembered two years ago we spent
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
a good deal of time I think uh talking
 
01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.910 align:start position:0%
a good deal of time I think uh talking
about

01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
e-discovery tools and and how the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
department was spending a tremendous
 
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:14.780 align:start position:0%
amount of time trying to you know
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
freeze records so that they could be
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
brought in for litigation and and we
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
talked about industry Trends and
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
procuring e-discovery systems has any
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
progress or thought evolved on that so
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
that is still the that is still the hope
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
but we have not developed but we have
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
not purchased the system or or moved
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
that forward because we've been working
 
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
and having it be a state a Statewide
 
01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:44.219 align:start position:0%
system as opposed to a DHHS system
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
certainly so moving on legislative
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
Services I just want to identify we only
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
have one real legislative Services
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
person that mostly everyone knows
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
um but we do have another thing that all
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
our attorneys do is if they represent a
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
division they also are the legislative
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
liaison so you'll see them coming in
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of legal analysis related
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
to legislation and also attend hearings
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
and things like that so that's just
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to identify here as
 
01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:14.030 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to identify here as
well

01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about you you
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
actually have two don't you legislative
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
Liaisons there's Mr Williams and then
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
there's a woman that does a lot with the
 
01:28:22.139 --> 01:28:23.930 align:start position:0%
there's a woman that does a lot with the
BDS

01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
BDS
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
um so Jenny oh Higgins does public does
 
01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
um so Jenny oh Higgins does public does
um

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
but she is dedicated just to behavioral
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
health so she's not under the legal
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
department and then we have
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
um a whole host of other individuals
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
that you'll see and probably have worked
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
with they're all general counsel
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys other than John Williams so
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
John is the only person that's under
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislative Services everyone else is an
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
attorney that represents the division so
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
you may have worked with them and think
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they're wonderful and legislative
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
people but they also have another job
 
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
part of their job yeah all right did you
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to say something Miss Roy
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
she answered the question all right
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so the
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
um prescription drug affordability board
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
is something that's administratively
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
attached to the department and I don't
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
know anything about even though it's in
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
my accounting unit because I don't
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
handle it at all so I'm going to let
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
Nathan speak to it we have a separate
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
issue on it later today don't we miss
 
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.629 align:start position:0%
issue on it later today don't we miss
Ripple

01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's not a Time dedicated to it but
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
it is on the agenda for today as part of
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office overall okay
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
it was listed last on our I can so it
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
might be best if I go through the rest
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
of legal and then we can just catch up
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
on that one because it's not anything
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm really involved in okay great
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
so we're at slide deck 20 now which is
 
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
the administrative Appeals Unit
 
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
so uh we handle the administrative
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
appeals process so it's adjudicative
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
process that gives Fair Hearings to
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
appellants recipients of services and
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
gives a final basically it's it has to
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
do with final actions by the department
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
so if the department takes the final
 
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
action the aau's jurisdiction is is very
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
broad so essentially a decision that's
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
made by by the commissioner and that can
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
be appealed as long as the person has
 
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
the right to an appeal it affects
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
impacts them it has to do with their
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
services or whatnot so we have things
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
like long-term care child abuse and
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
neglect cases
 
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
um Aid aptd or Aid to per to the
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
permanently totally disabled
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
um developmental disability eligibility
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
food stamps home care for children
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
all of these things durable medical
 
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
equipment prescriptions anything that
 
01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
you can imagine that we make a final
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
decision related to
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
um related to a client services they
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
they can appeal and and this is where
 
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:44.219 align:start position:0%
they would appeal is it the
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit as I
 
01:30:47.930 --> 01:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned already we have so right now
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
we have six and you'll see it later on
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
in our key challenges we have six
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
administrative appeals uh unit hearings
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
examiners three of those are brand new
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and then we have the unwind coming so
 
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's the five temporary part-time
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
positions that we've um we've created to
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
try to help we are not seeing a lot of
 
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
movement on those unfortunately so one
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
of our key challenges is getting people
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
recruited into those positions because
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
they really need we really are going to
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
need the help if we want to do appeals
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
in a timely way it can impact if if they
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
can't appeal and we can't get the appeal
 
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
out and we can't get a decision out then
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
it could impact the budget because we
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
have to maintain people people maintain
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
their benefits for the dependency of
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
their appeal during the pendency of
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
their appeal so if we can't make a
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
decision timely it will impact the
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
amount of time that somebody is
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
ineligible but remains on Medicaid
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
during during that appeal so we want to
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're as timely as
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
possible but it is going to impact it
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
could impact the budget so this
 
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit in one of
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
our challenges this is big this is one
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the big challenges we have
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner when have you had
 
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
any you haven't had any appeals yet we
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
have not because it only starts April
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
1st so we expect them to start rolling
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
in about mid-april okay yep okay and how
 
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:09.770 align:start position:0%
in about mid-april okay yep okay and how
long

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
will people have to do them I think they
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
have their
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
15 days
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
I'll have to check I'm not 100 sure how
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
many how many days they have to appeal
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can get that information to
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
great uh so moving on we have now the
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's offices so we have two
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's offices one of them is DHHS
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
Pacific so it essentially is any client
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
that has a concern with the Department
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
can contact the ombudsman's office and
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
they'll act as a kind of a mediator
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
they'll investigate they'll hopefully
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
come up with some solutions and
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
resolutions and so that's what our
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
general ombudsman's office does and then
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
our office of long-term care Ombudsman
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
specifically just deals with long-term
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:56.450 align:start position:0%
specifically just deals with long-term
care

01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
our long-term care Ombudsman just deals
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
with long-term care complaints
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's in the long-term care
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
Community they're in a nursing home
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
they're an assisted living they can call
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
the long-term care Ombudsman and the
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
long-term care Ombudsman operates a
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
little bit differently in that respect
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they are an advocate an advocate
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
for the resident where the general Klein
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman really just helps to kind of
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
mediate and figure out the problem and
 
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
and hopefully solve it for them the
 
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
long-term care Ombudsman is really just
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
an advocate for the resident and and
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully they do come to resolution as
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
well and that's their goal as well
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
so so that's an interesting dichotomy I
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
think that the Ombudsman on one will
 
01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
represent the citizens yes and the other
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
seems to mediate in between the
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
department and the citizens they try to
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
come up with the right answer really is
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
what they so the federal federal law
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
actually dictates the office of
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
long-term care Ombudsman so they tell
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
them you know you are an advocate for
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
the resident and it and it you know you
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
try to get them essentially what they
 
01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
try to get them essentially what they
want

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
um and be there for them they do though
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
I mean they do resolve concerns and
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
complaints right they just facilitate
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
conversations and things like that they
 
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
are in two separate units so they're
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
headed up by two different people so
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
they know their responsibilities
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
um they're not they're not in any way
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
related even though they're both under
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
the office of legal and Regulatory
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
services so I think they do operate both
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
really well
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
um but from the Ombudsman perspective
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
for the DHHS they're not representatives
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
of DHHS they're not representatives of
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
the client they're really trying to come
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
up with a resolution and what's the
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
right answer are they following the
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
protocols are they following the rules
 
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
are they doing what they should be doing
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
and that includes telling DHHS hey you
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
did not do right on this one right and
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
you need to fix this and and and they
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
also track and Trend that's something
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
new that we just added is Salesforce
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
which is part of the overarching DHHS
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
product we have now a Ombudsman
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
component where they can track and Trend
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
and see okay are we seeing a certain
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of complaints that are coming out
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
of just this unit like what is going on
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
with this unit how is it that we can fix
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the way that they're
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
communicating with clients and that kind
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
of stuff so it's it's actually a really
 
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
great tool for both the department and
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
the client and it's completely
 
01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.310 align:start position:0%
the client and it's completely
confidential

01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
so if I wanted to uh what happens a lot
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
I think it happens to all the
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislators is that we'll get a
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
constituent complaint saying DHHS didn't
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
do X and the X varies from really minor
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
things that I I will not minor but
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
really uh in the weeds kinds of things
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
that I have no clue what the right
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
answer is is there is there a One-Stop
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
shop that is easy to find on the website
 
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
for people to file a complaint yes yeah
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
for sure so the Investments office is
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
through that website interaction and and
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
what how that interacts with the public
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
so we don't actually have a the capacity
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the website for them to update it or
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know kind of type in a complaint the
 
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
phone number is listed on the on the
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
website and they can call and and then
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
intake will take them take their
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
information and then it'll get signed
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
assigned to an ombudsman to handle and
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes they when they call they'll
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
just directly go to and Buds and and
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
that person will listen and and find out
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
what the issue is and then work through
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
it and then it's the Ombudsman who then
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
takes the Reign at that point and and
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
they move forward and contact the
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
program area say what's going on here
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then they investigate and and listen
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
so that's really the the way to get in
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
is through the through calling the
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
muslim's office and that and that's easy
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
to find on the DHHS website so so it
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me that what we would want to
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
do for our citizens is to let them file
 
01:36:46.129 --> 01:36:46.139 align:start position:0%
a complaint online with some sort of
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
summary description of what their issue
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
is maybe a pull down to help categorize
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
it and the ability to upload files that
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
that that would speed so much of that
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think I don't think that that
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
I I believe I'm that's not under my
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so I don't know but I
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
believe there is something like that
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's available on the website it just
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
isn't directly linked to the ombudsman's
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
office so I'd have to I'd have to speak
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
with people at the department to see
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
where that where that might actually be
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay so I see Mr White taking notes
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
are you are you checking this because I
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
I really would like to understand that
 
01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
interaction because uh that you know
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's a point of uh
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
point of care in my view that we should
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
do you want to say more do you want to
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
keep going no no I'm I'm good are there
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
questions here I think uh representative
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh yeah this you know I do
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
notice um you know particularly the
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
long-term care ombudsman's office is
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
heavily Federal uh supported so I'm
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
wondering if is this an office they're
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
requiring you to have or uh is it when
 
01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
they're heavily incentivizing you to
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
have so as far as I know all 50 states
 
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
have an ombudsman's office
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if they actually dictate
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we've had one for so many years I
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if I've ever actually looked
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
to see if they dictate you know you must
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
have an office of the Ombudsman or we
 
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
can choose to have that so I'll have to
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to you thank
 
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.470 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to you thank
you

01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
so I did notice that your caseload has
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
really increased in the end budsman
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
area in the regular Ombudsman yes
 
01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:38.450 align:start position:0%
area in the regular Ombudsman yes
yes

01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
what do you attribute that to
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
so that's something that our that
 
01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:44.810 align:start position:0%
so that's something that our that
Salesforce

01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
Salesforce
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that part of that is that
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
we're cataloging them better and we're
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
keeping better record of them
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
um not that we weren't cataloging them
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
before but now we can actually see on
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know in track and trend on an actual
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
system you know where where we're seeing
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
increases and
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so I actually uh asked this exact
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
question when when I got this
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
information but um we're so they're
 
01:39:12.649 --> 01:39:12.659 align:start position:0%
compiling so we can look a little bit
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
more at at that information to see where
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if in the office of
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
long-term care and on budgets during the
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic did the
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
did that caseload increase it did it did
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
um it was it was really the office of
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
long-term care Ombudsman as well as the
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
provided a lot of support there were a
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
lot of waivers and things that were
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
allowable during that time that weren't
 
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
before so because the facilities were
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
able to kind of you know not have
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
visitors I think that that's really what
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
we saw from the Ombudsman perspective is
 
01:39:59.810 --> 01:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of people calling and saying I
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
want to see my daughter or the
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
daughter's calling saying I want to see
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
my mother you know and it was really it
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
was really impactful to see how not
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
being able to allow visitors in and this
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
was I mean it was a mandate by by the
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
federal government at that point don't
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't allow visitors if you have any
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
kind of covid or if you know what not so
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
I think that that's the increase that we
 
01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
I think that that's the increase that we
saw

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
saw
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
um generally
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
I would say that was most of our
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
increase was just the visitation issues
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
and we still see it honestly to this day
 
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
because there are some nursing homes who
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
when they do still have covet and feel
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable allowing visitors in and
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's a much shorter period of time now
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
you know and they're able to resolve it
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
quicker but it's still it is still
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
something that they're seeing complaints
 
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:42.410 align:start position:0%
something that they're seeing complaints
on

01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
well we're on caseloads I I see only 160
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
incidents on HIPAA
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
and my guess is that very few of these
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
are really uh valid correct yeah they're
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
just investigated and
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
um we like will have you know an email
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
went to the wrong I mean even the
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
smallest the smallest thing that may
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
have had somebody's name or information
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
um even if it didn't even have protected
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
health information we'll still log it in
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
and investigate it to make sure that
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
that incident is was either you know an
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
actual incident and we keep a HIPAA log
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
as a covered entity we're required to
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
keep a HIPAA log so we have that all of
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
that information for anything that's
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
been investigated and founded as a HIPAA
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
compliance breach
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
so just to connect you to another piece
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
of legislation that's probably going to
 
01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
pass there's likely to be a privacy
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
governance board yes and so anticipating
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
how this information should be shared
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
with the board yep okay sounds great all
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
right any other questions here
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
so the only last thing I have I believe
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
um other than oh yeah is the active
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
litigation so we have on slide deck 23
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.450 align:start position:0%
these are
um

01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
in in response to representative
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
Jewelers question earlier these have to
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
um all of the cases that are overseen by
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
the Office of the Attorney General so
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
these cases are not although the
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
attorneys in within the department are
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
not representing the department in these
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
cases the Attorney General's office are
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
they still impact the legal Bureau and
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
the department in general from all
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
discovery you know Discovery requests
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
and those type of things and we do a lot
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
of strategy sessions with them on how to
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
respond to cases give them a lot of
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
information on uh you know how to around
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
our laws because they're not experts in
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
all of the laws that we deal with every
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
day so this is just for your information
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily anything that we
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
need to discuss but I wanted to make
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
sure you had that so so
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious of the 640 open and
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
active if we go back to
 
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
um like right before the settlement fund
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
became law what what what has happened
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
have we seen a a shift to move out of
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
these lawsuits into the settlement fund
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
or or is this data basically Frozen at a
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
prior time so this information I got
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office just
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
this past week okay so
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
up to date yes all right
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing is key
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
challenges I think we've kind of touched
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
them on many of these but wages is one
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
of them the office of legal and
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
Regulatory is one of the biggest
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
challenges is that we need people with
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
not only higher education in office of
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
legal and Regulatory but we need people
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
with experience if you can imagine a
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
health in say Health Facilities
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
licensing you can't have a brand new
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
nurse go in and inspect and make sure
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
they're complying with all regulations
 
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
including standard of practice they're a
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
brand new nurse typically we're looking
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
for people that have years of knowledge
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
years of experience to come in and and
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
then you they then can regulate so in
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
trying to engage those individuals and
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
get them onboarded it does take some
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
take a higher salary because they're
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
making a lot more money on the community
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
and the same thing I mean we have
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
attorneys here and we need attorneys
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
that have courtroom experience if
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to go and start
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
representing dcyf
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and matters that are really in
 
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
important to the Health and Welfare of
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
kids we can't just have somebody who's
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
brand new out of law school going in and
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
representing these these children so
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that what we're seeing right now the
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
biggest struggle that we're seeing other
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
than getting qualified staff in from
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities is dcyf dcyf is really
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
struggling in obtaining staff that are
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
experienced and and want to do the work
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
that is really it's really hard work I
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
mean it's very emotional work it's it's
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
taxing it's a you know caseloads and
 
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
whatnot so we are having a very hard
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
time with DCF right now and I think we
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
have somewhere between seven and eight
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
vacancies out of our 28 or so staff we
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
have seven or eight vacancies right now
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
and are trying to recruit those but we
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
have over a lot of overtime a lot of
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
people covering multiple district
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
offices and having to kind of traips
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
around the state to to cover what needs
 
01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
the thing in the middle of BLC is jumped
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
out at me and and that is that the
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
department staff are finding more and
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
more non-compliance if we were to go
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
look at the root causes of increased
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
non-compliance is it because these
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
facilities are also having staffing
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
issues that's exactly it yep so if we
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
can help fix those staffing issues we're
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to help fix this problem I hope so
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
and and then on the wages
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph the 10 percent that is
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor is is that
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
going to solve this or or do you need
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
more you probably need less I imagine
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
but but what but what do you what do you
 
01:46:03.169 --> 01:46:03.179 align:start position:0%
think about uh the targeting are these
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh classified in a way or or these
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
aren't collective bargaining positions
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
are they the attorneys are well yes they
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
are yeah actually most of the staff
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau of Licensing certification
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're all classified employees okay
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
good to know yep all right and the
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
answer is yes 10 would be wonderful more
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
would be great all right thank you
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
um so legal we already talked about the
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
litigation and the Personnel Resources
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
related to Discovery especially in our
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
huge cases and then the AAU and the
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unwind I already touched upon
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
that as well so I think that that is all
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
I have other than
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
um what you had for the
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
would you like us to speak to that now
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking I I I think we we've
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
lost temporarily a couple of our members
 
01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.189 align:start position:0%
lost temporarily a couple of our members
because

01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
um they're testifying in other hearings
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%

01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
the challenges that's sort of my my
 
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:29.090 align:start position:0%

increase the expertise and the knowledge
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%

building on our recruitment platforms as
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
Workforce within the hiring manager
 
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.709 align:start position:0%
Workforce within the hiring manager

um

01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
what we really value in human resources
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
are internal core values is we really
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
want to develop our staff we really want
 
01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:22.580 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
processes that are redundant we really
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're respecting
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
others and our differences which also
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
leads to Innovation which I love we want
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to accept responsibility to
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
help with the ethical and legal conduct
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
and business practices which also allows
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
us to make mistakes and learn from them
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
but to also increase our knowledge
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
we also want to make sure that we're
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
able to communicate in a candid fair and
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
prompt manner
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
um I am on the page 27 and the
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.570 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
is

01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:07.090 align:start position:0%
is
56.77

01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
56.77 thank you
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
and it's on page 1085 of the governor's
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
so Human Resources like I said we have
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
31 positions I have one vacant position
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
right now part of Human Resources is
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
myself as the Director we have an
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
assistant director and then we have five
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
other departments within Human Resources
 
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have the Recruitment and onboarding
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
Department we just recently acquired a
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
talent acquisition manager who is really
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
heading and spearing the new recruitment
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
platforms that we're working on and the
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
reason why it's Recruitment and
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
onboarding is there is a understanding
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
that the retention starts with
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment so we're really trying to
 
01:50:58.490 --> 01:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
streamline that process to engage them
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
from the start as when they apply in the
 
01:51:03.729 --> 01:51:03.739 align:start position:0%
applicant tracking system
 
01:51:07.129 --> 01:51:07.139 align:start position:0%
so is that where the one new fce is
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
going yes
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
the vacant one and we just had the new
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
new position for the talent acquisition
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
manager okay so we're streamlining by
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
adding more people well we are
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
streamlining by using that one person to
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
work with our hiring managers who are
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
really the ones that have the touch
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
points with the applicants okay and and
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
and so the applicants are finding these
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
job opportunities online by and large is
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
that what these new acquisition systems
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
are that is the hope that is the trend
 
01:51:40.689 --> 01:51:40.699 align:start position:0%
so right now if anybody wants to
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
advertise outside they have to find
 
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
funding from within the department so
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
what we have proposed and has been
 
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:48.980 align:start position:0%
passed at fiscal would be several
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
platforms to be able to
 
01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
um externally post our positions and
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
actually look for applicants in a
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
proactive manner sure I'm going to go
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
back to one of my pet peeves from four
 
01:52:04.129 --> 01:52:04.139 align:start position:0%
years ago yeah
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
um when I just thought I would go see
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
how easy it is to look for jobs in the
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
in the state government and I want to
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
the I think the Das website
 
01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:18.980 align:start position:0%
and it was the worst absolute worst uh
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
employment opportunity website I have
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
ever seen I'm sure it was award-winning
 
01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:26.060 align:start position:0%
and it's poor quality
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
so what what are we doing different are
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
we go ahead so with that that is the
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's the division of personnel that
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
runs the applicant tracking system so so
 
01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
from my perspective at HHS we have to
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
work with that within that system in
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
order for the applicants to apply but
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is is we're externally
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
posting these positions to say listen we
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
have these positions and go into our
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
wonderful applicant tracking system to
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
apply and we're trying to lead them
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
there as easily as possible so by us
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
post externally we can lead them into
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
our system
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
all right so you're being very Artful I
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
I what I think I'm hearing you say is
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
you're developing workarounds so that
 
01:53:20.590 --> 01:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
you can avoid the Das horrible system
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and it's and and you're seeing some
 
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
hope that we're going to be able to
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
recruit better yes your word it's not
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
mine no yes yeah I get to be honest I
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
love that thank you
 
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
um no yeah and that's exactly it so I
 
01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
know that Mr White spoke to the
 
01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
classification that we classification
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
with system we have and he specifically
 
01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
said program supports uh support
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
specialist one two three uh in the real
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
world no one really knows what those are
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
so with these new platforms we're going
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
to be able to articulate a little bit
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
more that we are looking for a human
 
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.450 align:start position:0%
more that we are looking for a human
resource

01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
resource
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
um benefits specialist rather than a
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
program specialist so we're going to be
 
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
able to really Target individuals based
 
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:05.699 align:start position:0%
on what their qualifications are and
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to look to us
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
for what we're having to offer rather
 
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
than these um vague classification
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
titles okay but the front door Remains
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
the Same the Das yes correct
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing to burn that down
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
and start over and just come up with a
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
actual good system well I know that that
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be a Das point of right but you
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
would be involved right you're like a
 
01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:33.229 align:start position:0%
would be involved right you're like a
key

01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
key
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
constituency of the Das yes one yes one
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
would hope that that collaborative
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
relationship would continue yes
 
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
all right I I I I because every time I
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
hear we have a Workforce issue I can't
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
help but to go back in my mind about how
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
horrible our front door is oh absolutely
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
and I agree with that and that's one
 
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
thing that we are trying your words are
 
01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.790 align:start position:0%
thing that we are trying your words are
mine

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
mine
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate yeah we are we're really
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
trying to to work on that and I know
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
from what I have heard that they are
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
really trying to update the
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
um it's called New Hampshire first
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're really trying to update it to
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
the most modern version but it does take
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
time in order to get it there so what
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is really from our
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
perspective is get them to just click on
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
a link so they can go directly into that
 
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
job that they're applying for and apply
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
for it right even just finding the job
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
you want to apply for is just not easy
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
the whole search engine thing is broken
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
and you know you still got switchboard
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
operators in there and to Mr White's
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
Point too as well Das Department of
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is working on
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
the classification redesign which will
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
help modernize our classification system
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay I because I I suspect you're doing
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
an excellent job in every other area I
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
am but I I your words
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah we okay but so
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
so let's just go into your key
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishments see if you can summarize
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
that for us yeah absolutely so I've been
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
with the state for a year now
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
um and what we have been able to do is
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
really recognize that the processes that
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
we have seen are redundant so we're
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
really trying to streamline those
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
processes and it's not necessarily to
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the HR staff it's to the
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
benefit of the hiring managers that also
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
have other jobs that they're doing
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
besides this hiring Manager work we're
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
really trying to work on the retention
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
which will also assist the hiring
 
01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
managers because then they don't have to
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
go through the recruitment process yet
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
again and the retention by engagement is
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
really how we're working on that so
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
engaging employees in professional
 
01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
development and within
 
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:44.810 align:start position:0%
development and within
um

01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
trainings is really going to help them
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it's also going to encourage them to
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
stay within the state Service as well I
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
I I I just can't get off of this uh
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
website thing
 
01:56:58.679 --> 01:56:59.330 align:start position:0%
website thing
um

01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
are you prohibited from going and
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
building your own
 
01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:06.659 align:start position:0%
DHHS portal
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting portal um I'm not sure if the
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
word is prohibited and I haven't
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually even asked that but they are
 
01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
the ones in charge for the rules of the
 
01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
applicant tracking system so they're
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
reporting their metrics on how many
 
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
applicants we've had how many those
 
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
numbers that is their their role and and
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
I just just jumping in here I mean I
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
think from a statutory perspective under
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
RSA 21i it's it's it's pretty clear from
 
01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:35.219 align:start position:0%
that that Das is the coordinator of the
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
state system and I'm sure if we were to
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
put forward a proposal to doit they
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
would say why on Earth are you creating
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
a a shadow system of the existing system
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we already have today so I don't
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that that would uh be
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
be an option to today even if it was in
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
hb2 and you had some language that would
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
allow you to go do it
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I think I would probably defer to to
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet and and Dave Wieters
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
on on what that looks like because it's
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
important to understand and and I'm sure
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
when Das comes here to to speak to you
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that as
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
Christine was was alluding to the the
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
larger New Hampshire first system feeds
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
directly into that website which is why
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
like you know that database is pulling
 
01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
from a table program specialist too to
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
pre-populate like in the title so so I I
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
think it's there's a lot more behind the
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
scenes to understand when when
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
considering any sort of initiative along
 
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay well we're good we're hopefully
 
01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to make some changes in
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
streamlining licensing which is another
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
effort on the part of the legislature to
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
make Workforce Development
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
and our acquisition easier
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I just I I do do you think that Das
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
system is going to be able to keep up
 
01:58:58.490 --> 01:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
and basically as we change the licensing
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
requirements adapt rapidly to the new
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
environment and maybe go out of the
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
state somehow and recruit and Market
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first will not be able to
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
do that marketing that we're we're
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
looking to do as it stands right now
 
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay because like I get indeed ads
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
telling me I need to go apply that I
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
could be a forklift truck driver
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere they apparently know what I'm
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
qualified to do yeah and indeed does
 
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
pull you know getting into the
 
01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
recruitment technology it does pull from
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first sites but that's
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
really all that it does so it doesn't
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
when you click on those ads
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't bring you directly to that
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
posting it yeah it brings you to the New
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire First Site which then you have
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
to go search for it so Mr White I know I
 
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
think the commissioner said that
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
Workforce acquisition something like
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
that is one of her her most important
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
is this part trying to trying to update
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
and modernize and make effective is this
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
is this part of her vision of what must
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
so so I believe the commissioner had
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fiscal item that the
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services had
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward to fiscal committee the
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
other day
 
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
um for for licensing for for LinkedIn in
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
in order to get at exactly what
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
Christine is talking about as far as
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
being able to you know using algorithms
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
to Target potential candidates who live
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
within the specific region so that
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
instead of just posting We are then
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
actively reaching out because I think I
 
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
I think you know if if you take that
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
kind of more proactive approach towards
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
trying to find individuals then
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully that would lead to better
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
benefits instead of posting it and
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
hoping hoping for a difference I think
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I think we'll still have to
 
02:00:58.370 --> 02:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
work within within the system that the
 
02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
state has and and I think it's just
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
really important to make sure that
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
weighs in on that conversation because I
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
know as as Christine alluded to they are
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
working to to actively upgrade that
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
system in the coming years so
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right you can go back to where
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
you think oh wait a second represent a
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
stream yeah so just quick summary that
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
what what I understand you have staff of
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
31 and you're responsible for all three
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
thousand plus in the HHS uh system
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
um do you have any responsibilities uh
 
02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
for Quality Workforce issues versus any
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the critical service providers that
 
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
are contracted with is there any overlap
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
between your function and any of the
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
contractors at this time no okay
 
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and second if I may continue uh
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
unrelated question uh dcyf you know
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe you know it's virtually on the
 
02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:55.460 align:start position:0%
verge of of collapsed at a lack of
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
employment uh and I know we've taken
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
some action here in the last few weeks
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
how's it going there and and how how
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
visible is that uh to you and your team
 
02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so in the fall we
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
launched a on-site job there we have
 
02:02:14.109 --> 02:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
been been actively
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
searching in out externally for job
 
02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
positions or for the applicants to be
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
able to fill those positions I'm hopeful
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
that that 10 increase will also help
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
gravitate people there as well as being
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
able to to market the new approach for
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
dcys as well so we are actively working
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
with leadership in dcyf to fill those
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
positions to assist and and and
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
um also this past September when the
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
governor and Council were up on the top
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
of Mount Washington we did bring forward
 
02:02:50.450 --> 02:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
a number of enhancements requests to to
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
some of the positions at
 
02:02:55.609 --> 02:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
um at this at sysc as well just to try
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
to actively address that um the the HR
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
team work collaboratively to to get that
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
work done to try to make sure that we
 
02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
can recruit and retain staff there to
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
keep Staffing levels at an appropriate
 
02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:10.430 align:start position:0%
keep Staffing levels at an appropriate
level

02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
excellent so we were talking a little
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
bit about the Recruitment and Retention
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
based on the engagement of employees in
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
training and professional development we
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
have also implemented a new hire
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
orientation again day one when it comes
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
down to engagement we want to just make
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure that they have
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
um they are set up for success and they
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
know where to find the information one
 
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
thing as a new hire I wanted to make
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
sure that it was intuitive for where
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
they were able to find the information
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
that they needed and also we do use our
 
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
metrics we use our technology to make
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
sure that we are basing our decisions on
 
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
the information that we have it's really
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
important to us and then we've also
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
rolled out or rolling out a new learning
 
02:03:56.209 --> 02:03:56.219 align:start position:0%
management system which will also be
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
able to help employees and supervisors
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
learn in time when they are ready so
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
often we have you know meetings where we
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
we talk to or educate the employees on
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
something but that's not their time to
 
02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
to hear it so basically the learning
 
02:04:13.609 --> 02:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
management system will allow them to be
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
able to learn when they are ready to
 
02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
learn that information
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and then I did speak a little bit can
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
I stop you I did you just talk you just
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
talked about the learning management
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
system correct okay so I thought this
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
was another
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
centralized tool of Das
 
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
is this something you're implementing on
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
your own correct correct we needed to
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
implement a new learning management
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
system in order to reach external
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
um Partners to be able to train them so
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
we launched that external part back in
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
June of 2022 and we are currently trying
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
to launch it we're not trying we are
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
currently going to be launching it
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
um in the end of summer
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
for our internal employees okay I I
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
think that's all good thank you
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
um and just some of our key concerns is
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
the the process the redundancy so really
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
working with key stakeholders to make
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we're reducing our processes
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
um and as well as making sure our our
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
outcomes are appropriate
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
um we had five new administrators in the
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
last year in HR so where we think right
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
where we think that that might be a
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
concern it's also a really great time
 
02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
for Innovation and new ideas and
 
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
diversity of thoughts so we are really
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
coming together to collaborate and
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
making sure that HR is there as a
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
strategic partner for HHS to continue
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
the Relentless progression forward
 
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.290 align:start position:0%
the Relentless progression forward
um

02:05:50.290 --> 02:05:50.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not I'm not under your key
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
challenges I I note that
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
you don't have a key challenge touching
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
on the employee morale or or or Trends
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
in the employee employment base like for
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
example do we have an increase or
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
decrease in sexual harassment
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
allegations do we have you know other
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
other kinds of indicators that tell us
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
something about the morale of the
 
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:20.030 align:start position:0%
something about the morale of the
workforce

02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I think we can speak to the vacancy
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
rate with the vacancy rate could be
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
um Equitable to the morale right now our
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is at 19.6 which is a
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
little bit lower than it has been in the
 
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:34.830 align:start position:0%
past so
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:35.209 align:start position:0%
past so
[Music]

02:06:35.209 --> 02:06:35.219 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:06:35.219 --> 02:06:36.169 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
that is definitely our key challenge is
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
is making sure that we have the people
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
in the positions to get the job done
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and to to make that
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
happen for our external customers as
 
02:06:48.659 --> 02:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
happen for our external customers as
well

02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
so based on all of the the information
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that HR has been working on we are
 
02:06:57.410 --> 02:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
really trying to make sure that we're
 
02:06:58.850 --> 02:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
working on the engagement and the
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
okay but amongst the existing Workforce
 
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
you're not spotting any Trends in
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
kindergarten it was can you work and
 
02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
play well with others is our or we have
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
an internal issues of working and
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
playing well with each other yeah we
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
have a big focus on supervisors right
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
now really making sure that they
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
understand their role with an engagement
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
with employees giving them the tools
 
02:07:27.530 --> 02:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
that they need for Performance
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
Management giving them the tools that
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
they need in order to have difficult
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
conversations is really where HR is
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
all right I have one quick one uh I'm
 
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
not sure who this would be directed to
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
but I noticed about 28 of this budget
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
comes from federal funds what is the
 
02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
federal government paying for and why is
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that a a good number or not a good
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
so if if you turn to the budget briefing
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
book that you have if you turn to page
 
02:08:05.219 --> 02:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
book that you have if you turn to page
19

02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see accounting unit 56.77 and
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
listed there under the funding sources
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
um we we have a variety of funding
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
sources that are that are cost allocated
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not quite sure what I'm
 
02:08:41.209 --> 02:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
seeing in the right place oh sure
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
um okay page 20.
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I I apologize yes
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I'm on page 20 on funding
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
source about a quarter of the way down
 
02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
do you have a question you'd like to
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
I it and it looks to me like what you're
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
saying a certain program some of the
 
02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
costs have been allocated from General
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
from from the human resources uh budget
 
02:09:25.609 --> 02:09:25.619 align:start position:0%
to these other programs and it comes out
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
to 29 so yeah it's really a common theme
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
across many of the areas of ocom where
 
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
we're able to to cost allocate federal
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
dollars towards those positions just to
 
02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
leverage them in a more effective way
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions sure representative
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
Mooney well thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
you for being here on page 29 of your
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
slides here I see on the last bullet
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
implemented the federal vaccine mandate
 
02:10:00.649 --> 02:10:00.659 align:start position:0%
at the hospitals implemented is past
 
02:10:03.050 --> 02:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
tense I'm wondering is that still in
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
effect and are you still working
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
actively to do and Implement that bullet
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
item thank you thank you um yes back in
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
March of 2022 the federal mandate came
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
into effect so we were able to work with
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
Glencliff hospital and New Hampshire
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
hospital to make sure that a hundred
 
02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:31.099 align:start position:0%
percent of the employee populations were
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
in compliance and whether 100 is whether
 
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
or not they have vaccine or they
 
02:10:41.330 --> 02:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and you are still
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
working on that implementation as that
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
mandate is still in effect you're saying
 
02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.010 align:start position:0%
mandate is still in effect you're saying
correct

02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you does that go away
 
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
that that's when the National Emergency
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
declaration is intended to end does the
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate I hate calling it a
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
vaccine the injection
 
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
the experimental injection date is that
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
when that expires yeah 21 we'll have to
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that I'm not quite
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
sure they they separated the some of the
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
requirements you know with the
 
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
disenrollment versus the end of the
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
public health emergency I'm not sure in
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
that particular item but we can get back
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
to you okay thank you
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions here
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you along that same line do you
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
feel that uh with the vacancy rate being
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
what it is and this mandate being
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
implemented still is there a connection
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
at all between the two that you are
 
02:11:46.129 --> 02:11:46.139 align:start position:0%
missing some great talent because of a
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
federal mandate there could be that
 
02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
correlation I haven't really researched
 
02:11:53.089 --> 02:11:53.099 align:start position:0%
that but there definitely could be based
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire hospital vacancy
 
02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.850 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire hospital vacancy
rate

02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I think just one
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
important thing to to point out I just
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what what Ellen the
 
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
point the CEO of New Hampshire hospital
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
had spoken to earlier
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
um that that the labor market in general
 
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
particularly for nurses across the state
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
has been incredibly challenging
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
um I I know the New Hampshire hospital
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
associate released a report this past
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
fall where they had indicated that many
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
of their contracted staff costs I think
 
02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on this but I think they
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
went up by like 113 year over year so so
 
02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
you're seeing
 
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and New Hampshire hospital does have
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
a number of contracted contractors that
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
we rely upon as well as as our existing
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
staff so so there are there are a
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
variety of challenges in that area that
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
I know face New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
um anything else okay do you have any
 
02:12:58.089 --> 02:12:58.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay I have
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
12 11.
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
um this is this would be post time
 
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
normally to take a break we have the EAP
 
02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:14.270 align:start position:0%
and the equity and the program quality
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.689 align:start position:0%
and the equity and the program quality
[Music]

02:13:14.689 --> 02:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:14.699 --> 02:13:15.470 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
if I quit asking questions can those be
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
done in like 30 minutes total so um
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
today we we have the employee assistance
 
02:13:23.219 --> 02:13:24.410 align:start position:0%
today we we have the employee assistance
program

02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
um only and then I was going to have the
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
um and the remaining uh presentations go
 
02:13:32.330 --> 02:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
okay in that case I'd like to go ahead
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
and get the EAP up and then we'll end up
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
breaking for lunch until 1 20.
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.010 --> 02:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
and joining me is Michael Lawless the
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
director of the employee assistance
 
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.530 align:start position:0%
director of the employee assistance
program

02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I've appreciate the
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
excuse me good afternoon I appreciate
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
your time and the opportunity to speak a
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
little bit about the employee assistance
 
02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.709 align:start position:0%
little bit about the employee assistance
program

02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
so I'm Mike Lawless I'm the director of
 
02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
the EAP and
 
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:20.780 align:start position:0%
we provide confidential Services support
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
resources to all state employees and
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
their family members for all three
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
branches of state government
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I've outlined some of the ways we
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
interact with employees but I just
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of maybe jump to that
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
second bullet and say that when I
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we serve All State
 
02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
departments and their family members
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's a cost allocation formula where
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
the additional departments outside of
 
02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
HHS are contracted and pay for our
 
02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:48.950 align:start position:0%
HHS are contracted and pay for our
services

02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:14:50.569 --> 02:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
sure and and just to speak to that so
 
02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
basically when we are preparing the
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
agency budget in the summer we look at
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
positions across the state and based on
 
02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
the number of positions a department has
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
we then cost allocate a a portion of the
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
cost to operate the employee assistance
 
02:15:08.579 --> 02:15:12.649 align:start position:0%
cost to operate the employee assistance
program

02:15:12.649 --> 02:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
it seems like two years ago looking at
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
this the number that jumped out at me
 
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
was four
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many how many RNs
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
do you have doing this service there are
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
no RNs on staff there's seven positions
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
including myself in the EAP what's sort
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the normal kind of job or not job
 
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
description but job qualifications yeah
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I have a org chart here on page 34
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so my background is I'm a licensed
 
02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:46.619 align:start position:0%
social worker uh Master's level of
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
licensed addictions counselor
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
the four field rep positions that you'll
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
see on that lower row there's a master's
 
02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:00.599 align:start position:0%
degree qualifier for those positions but
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
there's also that combination around
 
02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
education and experience where a certain
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
amount of education and the Human
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
Services field or kind of resource
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
delivery system might offset some of the
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
education requirements I could speak to
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
kind of background and qualifications
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
for each of our staff if that would be
 
02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.209 align:start position:0%
for each of our staff if that would be
helpful

02:16:22.209 --> 02:16:22.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
so yeah just so you know the cynical
 
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
boundary condition you're bumping up
 
02:16:30.169 --> 02:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
against is that you know in the back of
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
my mind I'm wondering if this is
 
02:16:34.129 --> 02:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
something that would best be kind just
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
contracted out as a as a service you
 
02:16:39.889 --> 02:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
know why we're doing this in-house and
 
02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:42.500 align:start position:0%
if we're able to staff these four
 
02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.110 align:start position:0%
if we're able to staff these four
professionals

02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
at a hundred percent or whatever the
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
percentage is I'm just wondering given
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
the Manpower shortages in the state if
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
there might be better allocations we
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
have behavioral health issues all over
 
02:17:01.129 --> 02:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
the state so so I I I understand the
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
value of EAP I'm just trying to
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
re-establish in my mind why this is an
 
02:17:09.250 --> 02:17:09.260 align:start position:0%
essential internal government function
 
02:17:13.370 --> 02:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
and whether it's worth our tying down
 
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
these scarce resources when we have
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
Community needs everywhere sure that's a
 
02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
huge nasty question no I appreciate the
 
02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
the kind of forthright nature of that
 
02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
question and I think that's an important
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
piece for us in terms of how we consider
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
the work we do and what differentiates
 
02:17:34.009 --> 02:17:34.019 align:start position:0%
us from other kind of models or
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for employees or their
 
02:17:38.089 --> 02:17:38.099 align:start position:0%
family members to access supports and
 
02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
resources and so one thing that I would
 
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
say to that is even if we just looked at
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
the those positions those four positions
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's not strictly kind of a clinical
 
02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
background if I could frame it that way
 
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
in term in other words some folks do
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
have experience kind of uh maybe even
 
02:17:56.690 --> 02:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
pursuing licensure or some other kind of
 
02:17:58.610 --> 02:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise within a behavioral
 
02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
health model but not necessarily kind of
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily equate to this is
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
a person who could be a licensed
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
clinician somewhere else for that matter
 
02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:10.969 align:start position:0%
clinician somewhere else for that matter
um

02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
what I would say is I think there's a
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons to support our model and
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the value of the work that we do and so
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
you know just a couple of things that
 
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of come to mind quickly
 
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.709 align:start position:0%
kind of come to mind quickly
um

02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think really
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
puts us in a unique position is that we
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
in serving All State departments and the
 
02:18:31.250 --> 02:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
length of service the kind of breadth of
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
areas that we've all covered in our
 
02:18:34.849 --> 02:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
Journeys professionally I started with
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state in 2004 in HHS and have been
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
in HHS since
 
02:18:43.490 --> 02:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
is that we recognize that there's a
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
uniqueness to every state culture so
 
02:18:48.049 --> 02:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
much so that it's not even just that
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
there's a there's differences in HHS for
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
say compared to say the veterans home
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
right it's it's even within HHS you can
 
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
go into an agency and work with a work
 
02:18:59.450 --> 02:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
group and there's another work group on
 
02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
the same floor down the hall and there's
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
differences in unique aspects to these
 
02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
work cultures that somebody outside of a
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
state system might not necessarily know
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
I think that part of our work and our
 
02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
sensitivities to some of those
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
differences and our openness to trying
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
to meet folks where they're at and
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
provide resources that are appropriate
 
02:19:20.209 --> 02:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
And Timely knowing the state system and
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that occur within
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
the state system I think kind of
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
positions us very uniquely in certain
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
ways when we're trying to support work
 
02:19:27.479 --> 02:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
ways when we're trying to support work
groups

02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
groups
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
and individuals
 
02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
another piece to that is you know from a
 
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
personal touch standpoint
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the work that we do
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
is connecting employees with mental
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
health substance use providers in the
 
02:19:44.450 --> 02:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
community and we certainly have
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
relationships there but one of the
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
things that I again I think
 
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
differentiates us would be you're not
 
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to get just a name and a number
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
from us right and so we're we're state
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
employees we're citizens of this state
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
we kind of recognize some of the
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
challenges that might go along with that
 
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
but also the Personal Touch to that
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
equation is I wouldn't give you
 
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
somebody's or I wouldn't give an
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
employee somebody's name unless I would
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with accessing them
 
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
myself or even a close love when asking
 
02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
accessing that person themselves and I
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
think that's something that you don't
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
get just by doing an online search and
 
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
trying to find a provider in the
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
community so if we connect somebody with
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
a provider we've made sure that they
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
accept their insurance they have
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
availability in their schedule we've had
 
02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
that connection with the provider and
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
and we would feel confident in
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
supporting this employee and accessing
 
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
that provider so those are a couple of
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
different differences I think around our
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
services that are not available in other
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
maybe contracted providers
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank you how many total state employees
 
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:20:52.969 --> 02:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
the last estimate that I saw was around
 
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
11 000 I don't know if that's accurate
 
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
okay and how many touches or I don't
 
02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
know what you call them how many
 
02:21:04.610 --> 02:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
contacts did you have your how many of
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
your seven employees how many contacts
 
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
did they have with state employees last
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a great question and you
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
know really what that question also
 
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
touches on is kind of the Antiquated
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
nature of our our data management system
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
which we don't have we're moving to
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
accessing technology and be being able
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
to capture information in a more timely
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
way that reflects the work we do and and
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
speaks to some of those questions you're
 
02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:30.170 align:start position:0%
speaks to some of those questions you're
raising

02:21:30.170 --> 02:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
raising
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
so on average we serve between 550 and
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
625 clients per year and
 
02:21:40.730 --> 02:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
even that number is a little misleading
 
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
in that it's really just the tip of the
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
iceberg when I when I throw those
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
numbers out there what that's saying is
 
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
these are clients who've reached out to
 
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
us through many different channels and
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've opened a case on that client and
 
02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
so what that means is
 
02:21:57.899 --> 02:21:58.730 align:start position:0%
so what that means is
um

02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to be meeting with them on
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
average it's between one to six sessions
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
that we might meet with somebody
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
but we're also in positions we're
 
02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
providing resources outside of that a
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
bit and so I think what a data
 
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
management system allows us to do is
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
really capture in a in a larger way just
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
how many points of contact we're having
 
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
and really the depth and breadth of the
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
work that we're delivering we are short
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
a position now we've have we have a
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
vacant position that we've have an offer
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
and a start date of March 10th there's
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
been some transitions occurring in the
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
EAP I've been in the director role since
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
October of this past year our previous
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
director Paula Booth was in the position
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
for 35 years and so it's exciting time
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
for us because we you we recognize and I
 
02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
recognize the need for technology the
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
need for being available in different
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
places through different means
 
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking at all of our
 
02:22:56.349 --> 02:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
processes we're developing a
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
new streamlined approach to Conflict
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
Management how we kind of
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
Market ourselves to different
 
02:23:05.929 --> 02:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
stakeholders within State systems and
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
describe the services that we offer we
 
02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
have really ongoing strong relationships
 
02:23:11.330 --> 02:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of our referrals come from
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
supervisors managers HR in different
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
departments But continuing to keep those
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
relationships strong and provide
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
services that meet the current needs of
 
02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
state employees and their families
 
02:23:26.290 --> 02:23:26.300 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I just so you actually have
 
02:23:29.570 --> 02:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
face-to-face interaction with we do and
 
02:23:30.889 --> 02:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for bringing that
 
02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
up that's one of the other pieces to
 
02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
that kind of equation that separates and
 
02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
differentiates our us from other you
 
02:23:38.809 --> 02:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
know potentially contracted providers or
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we appreciate I personally appreciate
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
the value of that face-to-face
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
interaction I think ideally when we can
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
offer that and be present in that way
 
02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
not everybody wants to take that up for
 
02:23:53.570 --> 02:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
um but when you think about the
 
02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
complexity the complexity and the
 
02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to some of the topics that
 
02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
folks are bringing up their concern
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
around confidentiality I mean all of
 
02:24:05.210 --> 02:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
these things are really vital to our
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
program and our model but trying to
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
offer that and be present face to face
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
as much as possible but also recognizing
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
that there are people who because of
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
their work schedule because of their
 
02:24:17.570 --> 02:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
geographic location they just feel more
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
comfortable accessing us either through
 
02:24:21.550 --> 02:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
a telephone or some kind of video
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
resource and we have that availability
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
as well we've kind of moved into that
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
and offered that in in conjunction with
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
face-to-face primarily out of a response
 
02:24:31.969 --> 02:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
to coven
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
so do you think and do you work with the
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
human resources department around this
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
is being part of retention and
 
02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts because you have
 
02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
this kind of program available to the
 
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
employees which really isn't something
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's available
 
02:24:55.250 --> 02:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
in all Industries yeah it's a word that
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
was used here a little bit earlier I
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
believe was reactive right and I think a
 
02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
lot of the work that we've done through
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
the years has really been kind of a
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
reactive nature most of the time folks
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
reach out to us when there is a crisis
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
when you know either a personal crisis
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
or something in the workplace has
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
reached a level that the path forward is
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily clear but I we certainly
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
look at our role in retention as well we
 
02:25:21.650 --> 02:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
are a resource and a support to State
 
02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
Employees we're at orientations sharing
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
about the program putting a face to the
 
02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
about the program putting a face to the
program

02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
again to reinforce that face-to-face
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
piece but we're also looking for any
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity we get with all departments
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
to come back in and reintroduce
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
ourselves because there is a rebranding
 
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
going on in some ways with the EAP but
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
also because we know people are
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed when they do those
 
02:25:44.330 --> 02:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
orientations it's a lot of information
 
02:25:46.250 --> 02:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to be just somebody
 
02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
that's kind of out on an island that
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
folks think oh I got to reach out to
 
02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
them now because things are falling
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
apart we can be as supportive and we
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
often are now a supportive part of
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
people's work experience that isn't just
 
02:25:59.450 --> 02:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
when they're in trouble or they feel
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative kolorski thank you and
 
02:26:08.809 --> 02:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner hit on my my
 
02:26:10.849 --> 02:26:10.859 align:start position:0%
question but I'll take it a little step
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
further is there any way you can
 
02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
quantify or make any connection directly
 
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
with your services to overall wellness
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
and and retention
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes I I appreciate that I I'm gonna go
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
back really quickly to the previous
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
question I think it really connects well
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
here in terms of our relationship with
 
02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
HR certainly we have a strong
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with hhshr and you know
 
02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
kind of varying levels of relationships
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
with other departments HRS but they're
 
02:26:40.849 --> 02:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
all positive and they're all at a place
 
02:26:40.859 --> 02:26:41.809 align:start position:0%
all positive and they're all at a place
where

02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
revisiting them strengthening them it
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the employee right
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
because I think we're all working
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
together to try to create uh create
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
healthy workplaces for state employees
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
and managers so that productivity is
 
02:26:55.969 --> 02:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
increased which is one of the key
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
factors that an EAP can bring to a work
 
02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
factors that an EAP can bring to a work
group

02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
there there have been some trends that
 
02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
we've noticed they're certainly you know
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
with kovid and kind of financial
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
stresses we have we have state employees
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
you know when you talk about food
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
insecurity housing insecurity not many
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
folks would associate that with state
 
02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
employees right these are folks you know
 
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
for instance might be employed full-time
 
02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
and you think they might have kind of
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
deep resources in certain ways but in
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
reality what we know is that anybody
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
could experience a problem that any
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
other individual could right and so
 
02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
state employees have the same challenges
 
02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
and struggles that maybe some of the
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
clients might that we're serving in
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
other areas of kind of Service delivery
 
02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:41.870 align:start position:0%
other areas of kind of Service delivery
so

02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:43.849 --> 02:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I completely
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
answer that question I'm sorry no you
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
did it I I am seeing a direct connection
 
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
to maintaining Workforce by offering
 
02:27:54.770 --> 02:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
them so that that thank you I appreciate
 
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
you bringing bringing it back to that
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
because I think as we think about the
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
data management system and um we're
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
having some conversations with uh HHS
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're again in the green light to
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
implement a new data management system
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
those conversations are happening you
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
know what's exciting about that is while
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
we have to kind of walk this line around
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and protecting
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that's the primary kind
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
of piece to our program right as state
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
employee accesses us a manager accesses
 
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
us or their family member we're not
 
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
disclosing to anybody around who's
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
accessing us and for what right so when
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
people reach us reach out to us they
 
02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
know that their information is safe and
 
02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
they're protected
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
but by by having the ability to have a
 
02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
data management management system and
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
talk about who's asking accessing Us in
 
02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
some kind of overarching aggregate data
 
02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
around some of the challenges that folks
 
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
are dealing with maybe even grouping
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
departments together so we're not
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
sharing information that could
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
potentially feel like it's too close to
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
the line around confidentiality but
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
allows folks to see the trends within
 
02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
the state within state agencies I think
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we want to be that's
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
the place to kind of be able to refine
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
the work that we're doing in an ongoing
 
02:29:07.250 --> 02:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
way and
 
02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:07.790 align:start position:0%
way and
um

02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
share information about what we're doing
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
you you both asked the questions I
 
02:29:21.170 --> 02:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to next
 
02:29:24.050 --> 02:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and so so thank you for that and to
 
02:29:26.270 --> 02:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
come back and and talk about you know my
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
cynical nature the the optimistic side
 
02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:30.469 align:start position:0%
cynical nature the the optimistic side
goes

02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
goes
 
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that the EAP I think adds value that
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't get from a contractor by
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
being able to interact and engage our
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
our management our Senior Management to
 
02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
identify these sort of I mentioned it
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
earlier the the morale Trends what you
 
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in the workforce
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
that people need to worry about you know
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
from my point of view we always said you
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
know there's two things you gotta
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish the mission and you got to
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
take care of the welfare of the soldiers
 
02:30:02.410 --> 02:30:02.420 align:start position:0%
and so I I think that same
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
metaphor holds up in the workforce is we
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
got to get the job done but we've got to
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
do it in a way in which we take care of
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
the workforce and so
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you're able to
 
02:30:16.929 --> 02:30:16.939 align:start position:0%
protect privacy in a hardcore way
 
02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
because it's so important to everything
 
02:30:20.650 --> 02:30:20.660 align:start position:0%
you do
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
having management visibility into those
 
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of major Trends I think is is
 
02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
useful absolutely and and I don't know
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
that we could contract that out
 
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to think no you know obviously
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
I'm biased in my position in that way
 
02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
but even trying to be objective around
 
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
it I I think that there's there's a very
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
unique aspect to this program in in
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
places that might be challenging to
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
quantify I think that the data
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
management system moves Us in that
 
02:30:53.929 --> 02:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
direction but to your to your point
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
there around kind of the role of the
 
02:30:58.969 --> 02:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
manager you know I'm taking that from
 
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
what you were saying I mean when
 
02:31:02.929 --> 02:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
managers are modeling access to the EAP
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
they invite us in
 
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
um we have subtle resources in restrooms
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
with tear off sheets so people can
 
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
access our information in a private way
 
02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
but when it's modeled by supervisors and
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
managers it can make a a very important
 
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
difference right and so I think those
 
02:31:19.969 --> 02:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
are all of the pieces when we think
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
about how we all have a role in creating
 
02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
a culture where accessing resources
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
getting uh support it's a type of
 
02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
incentive that doesn't always attach
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
well to a financial incentive right when
 
02:31:34.969 --> 02:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
when I've been a you know work group
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
where leadership is invested in me it
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
makes all the difference in the world
 
02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's something that
 
02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
is present in a lot of places and it
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
makes a difference for employees do you
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
think if I went to a senior manager in
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS and and so you know what what kind
 
02:31:55.730 --> 02:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
of resources is the EAP program to you
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
you know would they would they have a
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
top of mind the idea that you provide
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
visibility into the overall I'm going to
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
keep using the word morale until a
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
better word comes up but
 
02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
status of the workforce I I would say
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes I I think it's a really important
 
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
question you're asking but I think it's
 
02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:17.180 align:start position:0%
also a complex question because I think
 
02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
managers continue to get more exposure
 
02:32:21.650 --> 02:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
to us when they've accessed us in a
 
02:32:23.210 --> 02:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
certain way or somebody close to them
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
has accessed us and I think when that
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
happens it informs the message I think
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
our part of that is continuing to think
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
about the marketing piece and getting
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
that information out around how we can
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
be supportive putting faces to the
 
02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
program things like that but also the
 
02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
fact that we serve all other state
 
02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:40.010 align:start position:0%
fact that we serve all other state
departments

02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
departments
 
02:32:42.889 --> 02:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
um you know because of the nature of the
 
02:32:45.290 --> 02:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
program the confidential piece of this
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
program the voluntary nature to the
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
program we're often behind the scenes
 
02:32:50.809 --> 02:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
right that's really our our position is
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
to help the helper and so you know when
 
02:32:55.849 --> 02:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
there's uh major events happening in
 
02:32:57.530 --> 02:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
this state that might look like they
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
touch dot or might look like they
 
02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
touched HHS dcyf State Police we're
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
usually in the background being
 
02:33:06.410 --> 02:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
supportive and trying to you know help
 
02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
kind of partner to contain what ever
 
02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
else is emerging out of that right
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
because you know we know things like
 
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
vicarious traumatization burnout
 
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
compassion fatigue are very real all
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
right so representative Mooney has a
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
question oh thank you very much your um
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
chart here on page 36 of the slides is
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
there any explanation for the color
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
schemes and I ask because I'm curious if
 
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's in order of what we most frequently
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
encounter and even beyond that I see
 
02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
some of the topics here are quite heavy
 
02:33:41.450 --> 02:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I can only imagine are without a
 
02:33:44.809 --> 02:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
doubt resourced out almost immediately
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
upon it being reported so I guess I'll
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
let you answer from there and see if I
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
have any follow-ups based on that sure
 
02:33:55.969 --> 02:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you you know one thing I
 
02:33:57.410 --> 02:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
would like to say if I could just take a
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
quick step back would be
 
02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:00.650 align:start position:0%
quick step back would be
um

02:34:00.650 --> 02:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
EAP work is very different than
 
02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:04.979 align:start position:0%
counseling work as well there's pieces
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
to the role that you know have some
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
overlap but
 
02:34:11.690 --> 02:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
what I find as part of my background was
 
02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
as a clinician working in clinical
 
02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
settings and then to move into the EAP
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
role as a field rep was my initial
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
position in the EAP it's a different
 
02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
skill set and so I just wanted to kind
 
02:34:23.929 --> 02:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
of name that too to go back to the
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
earlier question around Contracting it
 
02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
out or something along those lines
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no real Rhyme or
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
Reason to the color scheme I like the
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
idea of framing it that way
 
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I I had a colleague of mine kind of
 
02:34:40.250 --> 02:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
look over my initial color scheme and
 
02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
they went with this so I think maybe
 
02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I could say about that
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
piece and then
 
02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.730 align:start position:0%
piece and then
um

02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:52.490 --> 02:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
you're really kind of raising maybe two
 
02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
questions at least how I'm thinking
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
about it one is around
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
this referral process some of these uh
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
kind of resources that we may provide
 
02:35:04.370 --> 02:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
and how that might turn into a referral
 
02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:11.150 align:start position:0%
and how that might turn into a referral
um

02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.969 --> 02:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
so there are certain situations where a
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
referral to an outside agency would be
 
02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
the natural course and fairly soon right
 
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
and and that doesn't necessarily mean
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the problem or the presenting
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
issues are completely contained so an
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
example would be if somebody needs a
 
02:35:31.010 --> 02:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
resource around a legal resource or
 
02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
child care and they come in naming that
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
right we might be able to connect them
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
with a resource around that fairly
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
quickly we have uh places where we know
 
02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
there are good resources available we
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
have relationships with Community
 
02:35:45.710 --> 02:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
providers and try to bridge that Gap as
 
02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
soon as possible in that way if it's
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
requested but what we also are invested
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
in is a thorough assessment of the
 
02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
situation and the individual we work
 
02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
with and so when when you're engaged in
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
a process like that somebody might come
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
in talking about a legal resource and
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
then you find that there's a little bit
 
02:36:03.650 --> 02:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
more so another example would be
 
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
somebody may present and say I'm having
 
02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
some difficulty in the workplace right
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
well as we explore that a little bit we
 
02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
find out that maybe they're feeling like
 
02:36:12.530 --> 02:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
they don't get along very well with the
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
supervisor if we explore it a little bit
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
further we might find that the person
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
who's in our office is is kind of
 
02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
progressing in their drinking and that
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol is playing a bigger part in the
 
02:36:23.809 --> 02:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
equation then they were even initially
 
02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
aware of right and so part of the work
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
is is a thorough assessment in an
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing way whatever whether that's a
 
02:36:32.210 --> 02:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
one session or multiple sessions
 
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
connecting them with the resources if
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's something they're interested in
 
02:36:38.270 --> 02:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
connecting with but also so looking for
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
what may be emerging being
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
aware intuitive enough to kind of
 
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
explore in certain areas that arise that
 
02:36:46.490 --> 02:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
might suggest there's more going on than
 
02:36:48.410 --> 02:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
what they're presenting initially and
 
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
the same thing applies to work groups we
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
can get called into a work group
 
02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
somebody might hear oh you know you do a
 
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
training around respect in the workplace
 
02:36:57.770 --> 02:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
or something like that if we came in and
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
we just did a training because somebody
 
02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
named it we'd have a work group more
 
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
often than not that would say why are
 
02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
they bringing this in here why aren't
 
02:37:06.770 --> 02:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
they addressing Mike's behavior he's the
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
one who's causing problems in the work
 
02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
group so without a thorough assessment
 
02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
we may miss the opportunity to provide
 
02:37:13.969 --> 02:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
an intervention that really lands the
 
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
way the manager wants it to land
 
02:37:19.490 --> 02:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
so so I want to thank you for this
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I I I I want to put us into recess
 
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to keep you from saying
 
02:37:27.130 --> 02:37:27.140 align:start position:0%
something that's really important to you
 
02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
if assuming we're both here in two more
 
02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:31.030 align:start position:0%
if assuming we're both here in two more
years

02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
what would be nice also is just a
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
supplemental slide that tells us
 
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
something about the the status or morale
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the workforce you know if you guys
 
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
are spotting trends like you know how
 
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
how big is the fentanyl crisis affecting
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
our our employees you know you mentioned
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse you mentioned you know
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
economic stresses
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting just for us to to
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
get that next time I don't don't work on

03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
public transparency I don't want to get
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
started till oh okay we are we are live
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it being past uh 120 uh we're
 
03:25:58.610 --> 03:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
coming out of recess division three
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
um specifically first up is uh the
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
um we have uh Mr White from the
 
03:26:10.729 --> 03:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
department and we also have
 
03:26:14.050 --> 03:26:14.060 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant who is the
 
03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
current chair of the prescription drug
 
03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
affordability board uh we this is this
 
03:26:23.210 --> 03:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
is for the members
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh if you've never heard of this it's in
 
03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
part because this is the very first time
 
03:26:31.790 --> 03:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
division three has ever seen the budget
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
everything here before us is kind of
 
03:26:42.190 --> 03:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
um new stuff and it's on page 1084
 
03:26:45.469 --> 03:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
that's where the budget can be found
 
03:26:48.050 --> 03:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
so so with that
 
03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I assume representative Merchant is
 
03:26:54.889 --> 03:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
and start really quickly and then I will
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
hand it over to representative Merchant
 
03:26:58.680 --> 03:27:00.290 align:start position:0%
hand it over to representative Merchant
um

03:27:00.290 --> 03:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
you you have identified Pages page 1084
 
03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
as the location for the accounting unit
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
within the governor's budget there's
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
also a high level overview in the
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
presentation from this morning on slide
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
19 that includes some of the
 
03:27:21.769 --> 03:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
um authorizing RSA the the nature of the
 
03:27:24.849 --> 03:27:24.859 align:start position:0%
of the administrative the attached board
 
03:27:28.190 --> 03:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
as well as some over over a view on the
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
general purpose
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm sure representative
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
Merchant will be speaking to all of that
 
03:27:32.819 --> 03:27:33.849 align:start position:0%
Merchant will be speaking to all of that
so

03:27:33.849 --> 03:27:33.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:37.969 --> 03:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
has the department signed the mou
 
03:27:40.250 --> 03:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
the mou is still actively under
 
03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
development okay so that's no sometimes
 
03:27:46.370 --> 03:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
I ask yes or no questions so uh okay
 
03:27:46.380 --> 03:27:47.630 align:start position:0%
I ask yes or no questions so uh okay
okay

03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:48.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:27:48.530 --> 03:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:51.370 --> 03:27:51.380 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of the mou the mou
 
03:27:55.010 --> 03:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh this is really for the members as
 
03:27:57.290 --> 03:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
much as anyone but the purpose of the
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
mou is because the prescription drug
 
03:28:02.269 --> 03:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
affordability board is new
 
03:28:05.090 --> 03:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh there was some decision that needed
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
to be made about where they would be
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
attached they've been attached to the
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:28:16.190 --> 03:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
they've been attached there for
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
um basically Administration only there
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
is zero supervisory Authority within the
 
03:28:25.389 --> 03:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:28:28.070 --> 03:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
over any of the actions of the
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
03:28:32.690 --> 03:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
they're a wholly independent a kind of
 
03:28:35.929 --> 03:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
autonomous group except for every two
 
03:28:37.550 --> 03:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
years they're supposed to come and get
 
03:28:39.889 --> 03:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
their budget approved other than that
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:46.849 --> 03:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
um what else did I want to say about
 
03:28:50.050 --> 03:28:50.060 align:start position:0%
that relationship oh so like for example
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
in this in this budget that you see on
 
03:28:58.130 --> 03:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
page 1084 this was voted on and passed
 
03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
by the prescription drug affordability
 
03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
Board of which are what six to eight
 
03:29:07.570 --> 03:29:07.580 align:start position:0%
members and this has been passed through
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS and been Incorporated in the
 
03:29:10.319 --> 03:29:11.630 align:start position:0%
DHHS and been Incorporated in the
governor's

03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
03:29:13.729 --> 03:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
or went straight to the governor this
 
03:29:13.739 --> 03:29:14.570 align:start position:0%
or went straight to the governor this
time

03:29:14.570 --> 03:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get the overall
 
03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
context of where we are representative
 
03:29:21.410 --> 03:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
Edwards the flow you're speaking to is
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
correct the numbers I think could be
 
03:29:25.969 --> 03:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:28.250 --> 03:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay process that you're speaking to
 
03:29:28.260 --> 03:29:29.809 align:start position:0%
okay process that you're speaking to
yeah

03:29:29.809 --> 03:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:29:34.969 --> 03:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
is absolutely correct oh okay so so
 
03:29:34.979 --> 03:29:35.809 align:start position:0%
is absolutely correct oh okay so so
um

03:29:35.809 --> 03:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:38.090 --> 03:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
I think I think that's everything I
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
intended to say
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and then we pick up on the slide deck
 
03:29:45.889 --> 03:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
on page 19 prescription drug
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
affordability board and representative
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
Merchant what would you like to tell us
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
about uh your board
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
well speaking to the financial side of
 
03:29:56.809 --> 03:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
the equation not the policy side so I
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
think is the intent of this committee
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
um the way because this is a new we we
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
need to understand the mission and
 
03:30:07.790 --> 03:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
purpose so that we understand the budget
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
the mission of the board is to bring
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
more transparency to the pharmacy supply
 
03:30:15.050 --> 03:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
chain which goes from the manufacturer
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
all the way to the patient it's complex
 
03:30:18.239 --> 03:30:19.309 align:start position:0%
all the way to the patient it's complex
it's

03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:30:21.469 --> 03:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
convoluted in a lot of cases
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's something that doesn't have a lot
 
03:30:25.729 --> 03:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
of transparency to it and when you're
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a market that's going to
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
operate in a for your market economy one
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
of the cornerstones of any Market is
 
03:30:30.840 --> 03:30:32.150 align:start position:0%
of the cornerstones of any Market is
transparency

03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
and all the sports trying to do is bring
 
03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
greater transparency to what's happening
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacy supply chain to give an
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
example this would help you release some
 
03:30:42.290 --> 03:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
information I'll be glad to send it to
 
03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:43.010 align:start position:0%
information I'll be glad to send it to
you

03:30:43.010 --> 03:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
in 2013 Lantus which is their insulin
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
product had a list price of two hundred
 
03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:50.510 align:start position:0%
product had a list price of two hundred
dollars

03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
the net to them was hundred dollars
 
03:30:55.729 --> 03:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
rebates were paid different people along
 
03:30:56.690 --> 03:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:31:00.170 --> 03:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the list price was 300 and
 
03:31:01.790 --> 03:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
40 they're about to get to the exact
 
03:31:01.800 --> 03:31:02.630 align:start position:0%
40 they're about to get to the exact
numbers

03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
their increase only went to 125.
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
so the question I keep asking people
 
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturer is not getting the
 
03:31:12.769 --> 03:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
Lion's Share of increases
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
who's getting the Lion's Share
 
03:31:18.050 --> 03:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
same thing can be said with Eli Lilly as
 
03:31:20.330 --> 03:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
many documents out there in which the
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers prices have actually gone
 
03:31:22.080 --> 03:31:22.969 align:start position:0%
manufacturers prices have actually gone
down

03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
but the list price with patients are
 
03:31:26.690 --> 03:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
paying are going up
 
03:31:28.729 --> 03:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
so the goal of the board is to try to
 
03:31:30.889 --> 03:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
bring greater transparency into this
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
supply chain to understand what is
 
03:31:33.960 --> 03:31:34.969 align:start position:0%
supply chain to understand what is
happening

03:31:34.969 --> 03:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
and once it begins to understand what
 
03:31:40.190 --> 03:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
happens then to develop strategies based
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
upon the information we obtain
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the goal the board
 
03:31:44.399 --> 03:31:45.769 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the goal the board
is

03:31:45.769 --> 03:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:31:48.050 --> 03:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we're dealing with public
 
03:31:48.060 --> 03:31:49.969 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we're dealing with public
domain

03:31:49.969 --> 03:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
domain
 
03:31:52.010 --> 03:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
public domain folks is paid by taxpayer
 
03:31:52.020 --> 03:31:52.910 align:start position:0%
public domain folks is paid by taxpayer
dollars

03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
the goal this board is to bring down the
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
burden to the taxpayer
 
03:31:59.210 --> 03:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
is find a ways to reduce prescription
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
drug costs I think we all can agree
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
03:32:04.969 --> 03:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
help the taxpayer and this is one of the
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
ways to try to get there so first and
 
03:32:07.620 --> 03:32:08.750 align:start position:0%
ways to try to get there so first and
foremost

03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
foremost
 
03:32:08.760 --> 03:32:11.150 align:start position:0%
foremost
transparency

03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
develop strategies to bring down the
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
overall prescription cost
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
which is a burden to the taxpayers
 
03:32:19.610 --> 03:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
because of the ones paying for say
 
03:32:22.250 --> 03:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
employees County Employees school
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
districts municipalities
 
03:32:26.269 --> 03:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the two-prong part of
 
03:32:26.279 --> 03:32:28.370 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the two-prong part of
it

03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
so so does your board have regulatory
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
Authority and when you create a strategy
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
how do you implement it
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
Powers within the board
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
to ascertain information that is
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
necessary for the board to understand
 
03:32:49.370 --> 03:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
the transparency to it so yes it does
 
03:32:51.229 --> 03:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
have rulemaking authority which is
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
granted by the legislative body when
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
this is passed and it's basically allows
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the board to
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
use its Authority
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
as much as possible
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
to work with a entities in the farm
 
03:33:05.809 --> 03:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
supply chain for the manufacture all the
 
03:33:07.630 --> 03:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
way to the patient to try to understand
 
03:33:11.530 --> 03:33:11.540 align:start position:0%
who's getting the bites of the Apple
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
so is it fair to say your regulatory
 
03:33:18.729 --> 03:33:18.739 align:start position:0%
Authority is specific in scope to
 
03:33:22.090 --> 03:33:22.100 align:start position:0%
mandating data
 
03:33:25.809 --> 03:33:25.819 align:start position:0%
calls that that you ask for data through
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory enforcement and they provide
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
you the regular the data and if not in
 
03:33:33.530 --> 03:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
your current fee structure you can find
 
03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
your current fee structure you can find
them

03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
if they don't report the data required
 
03:33:38.690 --> 03:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
by the board
 
03:33:40.090 --> 03:33:40.100 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
confidentiality to protect the data
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes the board can Levy a fine
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
but again I'll go back to when we talk
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
about confidentiality this is well
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
thought through
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with pricing or cost
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
factors and so forth a lot of them are
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
protected through confidentiality
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
there is a limited very limited number
 
03:34:04.250 --> 03:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
of people who have access to any of that
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
pricing data or cost data as well as if
 
03:34:09.410 --> 03:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's ever leaked by anyone else there's
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
severe consequences
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:34:19.200 --> 03:34:21.110 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
does this board have any known or
 
03:34:27.889 --> 03:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
suspected redundancies with other state
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
operations such as fee setting on this
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
industry any redundancies in the data
 
03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
collection effort or any redundancy in
 
03:34:39.650 --> 03:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
the reporting efforts
 
03:34:41.809 --> 03:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
the clarification we do not have any
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
authority over price
 
03:34:46.490 --> 03:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
none whatsoever that's restricted by the
 
03:34:47.929 --> 03:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
federal government to the Commerce
 
03:34:47.939 --> 03:34:49.010 align:start position:0%
federal government to the Commerce
Clause

03:34:49.010 --> 03:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
Clause
 
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
what the board does is has the ability
 
03:34:52.729 --> 03:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
to get the data so the data with the
 
03:34:54.769 --> 03:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
board's looking for to utilize to
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
minimize redundancy is to use the what
 
03:34:59.809 --> 03:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
they call chisdator which is what the
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
all-pair claims data at the same time
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
the board is in a unique position
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
because it can work with other entities
 
03:35:09.170 --> 03:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
outside of the state including
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire flag State
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
Flagship University to help with the
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
analysis of the data we also have unique
 
03:35:18.650 --> 03:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
Authority in a sense that we look at the
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
data for rebates coming back from the
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
pbms that's something the board has that
 
03:35:25.490 --> 03:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
no other agency in the state has
 
03:35:25.500 --> 03:35:28.250 align:start position:0%
no other agency in the state has
currently

03:35:28.250 --> 03:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
so what to the my yes or no question I I
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of yes in there is is that
 
03:35:38.030 --> 03:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
there is some redundancy potentially in
 
03:35:41.690 --> 03:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
the data collection effort but but for
 
03:35:43.490 --> 03:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
that example
 
03:35:46.250 --> 03:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
um the board would first look to see
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
what's already available before issuing
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
a parallel or secondary request for the
 
03:35:55.969 --> 03:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
same data you you're you're looking at
 
03:35:58.190 --> 03:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
the data that's already available before
 
03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
demanding it from the private sector
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right and then I
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think you address the fees
 
03:36:07.269 --> 03:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
are the fees
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
redundant because the the Department of
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
Insurance charges many of these same
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
entities to operate in the state so so
 
03:36:19.849 --> 03:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
to what extent are the fees redundant
 
03:36:22.190 --> 03:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see the Visas being redundant
 
03:36:24.650 --> 03:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
the fees are unique in their own right
 
03:36:27.530 --> 03:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
um we pay if you look at the same thing
 
03:36:30.290 --> 03:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
with other agencies you think about my
 
03:36:30.300 --> 03:36:31.070 align:start position:0%
with other agencies you think about my
car

03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
car
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
I pay registration vehicle I pay a gas
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
tax I pay a toll tax has all up in one
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I guess you have to frame
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
when you talk about redundancy or
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
duplication is how you frame it the fee
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about currently is in
 
03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:48.110 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about currently is in
statute

03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
the board is mandated to send out a fee
 
03:36:50.939 --> 03:36:52.550 align:start position:0%
the board is mandated to send out a fee
assessment

03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
so are you are you familiar with the uh
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
the jail the jail car meeting of Last
 
03:37:01.610 --> 03:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
Friday where they specifically looked at
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
the request of the board to
 
03:37:08.050 --> 03:37:08.060 align:start position:0%
um to have their fees considered fees
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
and gel car came back unanimously and
 
03:37:14.330 --> 03:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
said that they recommended the
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislature that we review and make
 
03:37:19.010 --> 03:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
possible legislative change to the
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute that they perceive the fee
 
03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:23.050 align:start position:0%
statute that they perceive the fee
structure

03:37:23.050 --> 03:37:23.060 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:37:27.050 --> 03:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
to already be a significant part of
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the insurance
 
03:37:31.849 --> 03:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
department and that the fees therefore
 
03:37:33.790 --> 03:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
from this board
 
03:37:37.010 --> 03:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to be taxes
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
that was the key word could be and I
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
think what they're looking for is
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
legislation to clarify that so it's no
 
03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
longer a good but provide Clarity to it
 
03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay so so the motion that they voted
 
03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
unanimously on Republicans and Democrats
 
03:37:54.530 --> 03:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
is that they all came together to
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
recommend that the legislature review
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
and make possible legislative changes to
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
the statute are you aware that these
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
changes have are being suggested
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere in an amendment or in a bill or
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
we have House Bill 172 which is
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
before Commerce oops
 
03:38:17.090 --> 03:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
Commerce has said Commerce took to
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
retain the bill do exactly what you're
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
talking about representative Edwards is
 
03:38:23.450 --> 03:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
to look at different issues that have
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
been raised since the board's been up
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
and running are trying to get up and
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
running and I think that's the place for
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including this issue to be
 
03:38:34.670 --> 03:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
addressed is in house bill 172. it's
 
03:38:36.170 --> 03:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
been retained and for us to sit down
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
collectively and figure out how to make
 
03:38:38.700 --> 03:38:39.710 align:start position:0%
collectively and figure out how to make
it

03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:38:42.769 --> 03:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
work legislatively so as the prime
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 172 I'm glad that you're
 
03:38:49.849 --> 03:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
talking about it uh initially it was met
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
with opposition from the prescription
 
03:38:54.889 --> 03:38:54.899 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board and it has the
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
position shifted to where you now
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
embraced 172. I didn't say I embraced it
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
Senator I mean represent Edwards I
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
embraced the concept of working with
 
03:39:06.410 --> 03:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
everyone to improve the legislation that
 
03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
we need to make the board and provide
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
Clarity to it okay and then what's
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
happening 172 but clear for those who
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
aren't here was part of it was to put
 
03:39:16.969 --> 03:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
the board on ice for two years basically
 
03:39:19.550 --> 03:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
to kill it that is not what the board
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
agreed to what the board was willing to
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
sit down with everyone and all the
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from legislative people
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pharma pbms insurance companies and sand
 
03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
Pharma pbms insurance companies and sand
cake

03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
cake
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
how do we work together and how do we
 
03:39:33.410 --> 03:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
take the legislation we have before us
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
and make it work
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's what the board agreed to okay and
 
03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
then on the reporting redundancy
 
03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
um maybe maybe it isn't all that
 
03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
redundant but to what extent is the
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
state and the fed's already providing
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
reports so that the public has an
 
03:39:56.110 --> 03:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have transparency into
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
the prices being charged not not the
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
costs in the supply chain but because I
 
03:40:04.969 --> 03:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
think that's what you really want to get
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
at I think your board is interested in
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
the costs of the supply chain but but
 
03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm just asking about the prices
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
is there already some level of price
 
03:40:16.729 --> 03:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
transparency being provided through the
 
03:40:20.269 --> 03:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
feds primarily not that I'm aware of
 
03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
there are requires by some of the
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
federal agencies to try to provide some
 
03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
called pricing structure out there the
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
challenge that anyone has when you get
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
into a prescription drug price is
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the co-payment
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
deductible it's so many flavors to the
 
03:40:43.010 --> 03:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
ice cream it's very difficult for the
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
uninformed patient to ascertain what's a
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
fair price
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
is is is this the predominant
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
a lever that the board has to influence
 
03:40:59.950 --> 03:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
price containment is the publishing of
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
price reports so that various entities
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
know about the prices being charged so
 
03:41:08.929 --> 03:41:08.939 align:start position:0%
that they have a better idea of where
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
they may they may find some negotiation
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
points you're providing data to for
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
others who make decisions and negotiate
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
that's the goal okay getting back to the
 
03:41:23.210 --> 03:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
same thing we're trying to get to is
 
03:41:25.610 --> 03:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
first and foremost we have to understand
 
03:41:28.370 --> 03:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
it ourselves right because we can't
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
develop a strategy unless you understand
 
03:41:33.410 --> 03:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
what it is you're dealing with right so
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
so I was listening to um
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
a White House briefing the other day and
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
and and they were they were very happy
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
that they've done a lot to to contain
 
03:41:46.610 --> 03:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
the price of drugs and so if if the
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
White House is already working on drug
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
price containment is is this overall
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
program simply just redundant here at
 
03:41:58.010 --> 03:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
the state level what what can this a
 
03:42:02.210 --> 03:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
tiny little state of 1.3 million do in a
 
03:42:04.429 --> 03:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
market that's Global that the federal
 
03:42:06.110 --> 03:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
government's already trying to work on
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
what what what what what what do we
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
think we're doing
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
well many times States act as
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
Laboratories that's part of what we see
 
03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
Laboratories that's part of what we see
many

03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
opportunities at the state level for us
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
to create and look at things that we can
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
do because we're Nimble this is New
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're small we all know each
 
03:42:26.210 --> 03:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
other we work together
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
that you can't find the federal level so
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
by working with
 
03:42:32.690 --> 03:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
different entities
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
what I call the New Hampshire way
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
we can probably do things here more
 
03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
minimally and more quickly than you can
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
at the federal level and if we find
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
something that is Meaningful then we can
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
bring it to the federal level saying
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
this is what we found in New Hampshire
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
and be proud of it
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be huge to make
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
something work isn't it the case that
 
03:42:55.250 --> 03:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
Maine is operating on under essentially
 
03:42:58.490 --> 03:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
the same legislation that New Hampshire
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
currently is and what what has been the
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
main experience at being successful and
 
03:43:06.650 --> 03:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
standing this system up and coming up
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
with meaningful reports Maine has the
 
03:43:12.290 --> 03:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
same issue we have here in New Hampshire
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
it is ill-funded it's not funded
 
03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
we've for the most part all the work has
 
03:43:20.450 --> 03:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
been done by the board I'm very thankful
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
the board members on the board have
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
volunteered their time right so at this
 
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
point in time all the work that we've
 
03:43:28.370 --> 03:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
tried to put into it to get this board
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
up and running to do what it was set out
 
03:43:31.250 --> 03:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:43:33.410 --> 03:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
has been somewhat hindered because we
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
haven't had the resources to really
 
03:43:37.610 --> 03:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
fully engage all right I've watched that
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
board a bit and I've been impressed with
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
the level of volunteerism that's been
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
driving thank you what they've done and
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
what you've done you've been a very
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
effective leader
 
03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay uh I've asked a lot of questions a
 
03:43:53.750 --> 03:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
lot of those questions I meant to help
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
just for you that have never listened or
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
looked at this to have some idea what
 
03:44:01.130 --> 03:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
we're what we're dealing with
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
um are there questions representative
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh if I heard your testimony
 
03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
correctly it sounds it sounds like um
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
maybe one of your hunches is that
 
03:44:15.969 --> 03:44:15.979 align:start position:0%
there's something in the supply chain
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's taken a big bite out of the
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical apple and maybe not not
 
03:44:25.849 --> 03:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
adding that much value but since most of
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the traditional kind of data sources
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
they're either dealing with
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers wholesale prices or the
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
amount paid at the consumer end
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
are you thinking that you're going to
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of be able to see what happens uh
 
03:44:46.490 --> 03:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
between the manufacturer's price and
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
then ultimately what the customer pays
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
and and do you think there's anything
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
there that that we could act on at some
 
03:44:57.010 --> 03:44:57.020 align:start position:0%
point in the future
 
03:44:59.929 --> 03:44:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's one of the questions we'd like to
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
ask I mean one of the other things that
 
03:45:06.530 --> 03:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
I worked in the hospital system for
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
several years
 
03:45:08.399 --> 03:45:09.950 align:start position:0%
several years
and

03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
one of the things people advocate for is
 
03:45:14.929 --> 03:45:14.939 align:start position:0%
having the outside pharmacies sending
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
the product to the hospital to cut the
 
03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
cost down
 
03:45:21.610 --> 03:45:21.620 align:start position:0%
we have at the medical center
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
refrigerator is full of drugs that we
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't use that someone paid for
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
and why we can't use it is all of a
 
03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
sudden you have a patient's therapy it
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
changes either they
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
can't take the drug anymore the blood
 
03:45:36.349 --> 03:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
level won't support it whatever it may
 
03:45:36.359 --> 03:45:37.070 align:start position:0%
level won't support it whatever it may
be

03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:45:38.929 --> 03:45:38.939 align:start position:0%
we've said to the manufacturers can we
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
send it back to you we don't want it
 
03:45:40.859 --> 03:45:41.690 align:start position:0%
send it back to you we don't want it
back

03:45:41.690 --> 03:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:45:44.929 --> 03:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
why don't they want it back they sold it
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
number two give another example of
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
things that I'm not trying to
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
get away from the question but
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
try to explain to people within its
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
Dynamics is that we had a situation
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
where our hemophilia program
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
these are individuals that have a living
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
disorder they will lead to death
 
03:46:06.410 --> 03:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
basically so you have Factor you give to
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
them we took a lot of time literally to
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
get the smallest possible vial
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
to the patient why to minimize the waste
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
so then we went up against an insurance
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
company that wanted to charge 80 cents
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
less 80 or 20 less than we were charging
 
03:46:29.330 --> 03:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
for the unit in the vial
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
they weren't paying attention and taking
 
03:46:35.929 --> 03:46:35.939 align:start position:0%
the time because the time it intense to
 
03:46:37.610 --> 03:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
get the smallest vial they standardized
 
03:46:37.620 --> 03:46:38.630 align:start position:0%
get the smallest vial they standardized
it

03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:46:40.490 --> 03:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot of waste they were
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
sending out 100 units of factor when the
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
patient only needed 60.
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
we would take find the 60 unit vial so
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
on a unit basis
 
03:46:52.130 --> 03:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
it was less costly to the manufacturer
 
03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
but the overall cost was a lot higher
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
these are the examples I'm trying to
 
03:46:55.920 --> 03:46:56.990 align:start position:0%
these are the examples I'm trying to
explain

03:46:56.990 --> 03:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
explain
 
03:46:58.610 --> 03:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's what the board's trying to get to
 
03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
is it's not just looking at the overall
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
cost because of the price of the product
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
but how the product is utilized could we
 
03:47:07.370 --> 03:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
somehow work with Physicians to help
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
incentivize them and educate them to use
 
03:47:12.050 --> 03:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
less costly generics it supports the
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
brand name one which is what Farmers out
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
there promoting all the time
 
03:47:17.450 --> 03:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
at the medical center we talked about
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
that with samples and why do Physicians
 
03:47:21.889 --> 03:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
have samples
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
simple reason is when they're dealing
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
with a patient you want the patient to
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
start in something to have a week or so
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
to try the drug
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
I was making the application at the
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
medical center why don't we give the
 
03:47:35.570 --> 03:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
docs in the clinic
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
all the generics they want
 
03:47:39.889 --> 03:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
they're peanuts
 
03:47:41.330 --> 03:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
but it was one of those things back to
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
say these these are things that we could
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
talk about at the board level
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
back to represent Stringham is that's
 
03:47:49.729 --> 03:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
part of it it's not just looking at the
 
03:47:51.290 --> 03:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
cost of the unit for self but
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
utilization is a big part of it the
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
other side of the coin is it could be a
 
03:47:56.690 --> 03:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
situation where maybe the drug itself
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
even though it's costly is bringing down
 
03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
medical costs so you've got to look at
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
this thing holistically not look at it
 
03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:04.370 align:start position:0%
this thing holistically not look at it
myopically

03:48:04.370 --> 03:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
myopically
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
so so the board to your example will
 
03:48:10.570 --> 03:48:10.580 align:start position:0%
have the regulatory authority to require
 
03:48:13.490 --> 03:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
data collection and provision to the
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
state to talk about how much they charge
 
03:48:19.370 --> 03:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
and how a individual vial of a
 
03:48:23.690 --> 03:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
particular drug may be utilized yes
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so look so let's let's
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions at the
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
overall program I want to I want to move
 
03:48:34.090 --> 03:48:34.100 align:start position:0%
into the revenues here
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Waller no okay okay so
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh representative yes if
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
I can drive your attention to something
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
I passed out a piece of paper
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
um In fairness to uh DHHS and to Mr
 
03:48:46.920 --> 03:48:48.469 align:start position:0%
um In fairness to uh DHHS and to Mr
White

03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
White
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
um he was submitting data to the budget
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
requirement LBA based upon an old budget
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
we put together I think was the numbers
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
went to fiscal committee many years ago
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like many years ago and In
 
03:49:04.250 --> 03:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
fairness though Mr White he didn't have
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
the most recent budget the board had
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
passed the January 3rd so if you look at
 
03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
the administrative attached
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
which is section 21 G10
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
which is also in the handout on the
 
03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:20.090 align:start position:0%
which is also in the handout on the
slide

03:49:20.090 --> 03:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
slide
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're I don't see a 21 G10 I'm
 
03:49:24.729 --> 03:49:24.739 align:start position:0%
lost I I see
 
03:49:28.010 --> 03:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
normal handout and I see the governor's
 
03:49:28.020 --> 03:49:28.969 align:start position:0%
normal handout and I see the governor's
budget

03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:49:30.889 --> 03:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
those are the two documents I'm seeing
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
am I supposed to look elsewhere I handed
 
03:49:35.570 --> 03:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
one out it has a cover page with an
 
03:49:37.010 --> 03:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
email from representative Merchant and
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
the last page I believe is the statute
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you oh okay so when you're saying
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
G10 this is the this is a statute
 
03:49:46.729 --> 03:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
correct okay and what are we looking at
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
at the statute
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
if you look at the statute if you look
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.779 --> 03:50:00.889 align:start position:0%
 
B

03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
2C b as in boy boy
 
03:50:04.080 --> 03:50:09.950 align:start position:0%
2C b as in boy boy
okay

03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
all right so so that that that that's
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
the statutory language of what I said
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
earlier that the commissioner is
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
obligated just simply pass through your
 
03:50:22.130 --> 03:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
budget correct but the budget that
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking for on page 1084 was not
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
built upon what the board approved but
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
what Mr White had to work from before
 
03:50:33.530 --> 03:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
then so what you're you're saying is and
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
let me check with Mr White so what I
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing representative
 
03:50:40.729 --> 03:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
Merchants say is that the for example
 
03:50:43.250 --> 03:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
the total revenue line
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
ought to be 451 900 and in the budget
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
submitted through the governor's process
 
03:50:55.210 --> 03:50:55.220 align:start position:0%
it's 346 566 basically 105 000 less
 
03:50:58.010 --> 03:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
which do you understand should be the
 
03:50:59.650 --> 03:50:59.660 align:start position:0%
correct should be the correct number
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
when we prepared
 
03:51:05.170 --> 03:51:05.180 align:start position:0%
um just which one is correct
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
the budget that is that was just handed
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
out to the the 450. okay all right I
 
03:51:12.410 --> 03:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
just want us to be looking at the right
 
03:51:16.849 --> 03:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
thing okay so so how how would do you
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
propose we fix the governor's budget or
 
03:51:22.490 --> 03:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
should we be considering just straight
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
adoption in division three of the handed
 
03:51:27.950 --> 03:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
out budget
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I I will be submitting to the to the
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
um to the committee a series of change
 
03:51:36.889 --> 03:51:36.899 align:start position:0%
requests included within that change
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
request series would would be this
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
updated budget here
 
03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:42.830 align:start position:0%
updated budget here
okay

03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
so so we don't need to take any action
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
presumably until we take action on your
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
budget request proposal budget change
 
03:51:54.650 --> 03:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
proposal yes we'll submit a summary
 
03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
document along with the additional
 
03:51:59.809 --> 03:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
detail for the LBA okay so
 
03:51:59.819 --> 03:52:01.490 align:start position:0%
detail for the LBA okay so
um

03:52:01.490 --> 03:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.130 --> 03:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
so now as I understand it as we I want
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
to I want to drive through the revenues
 
03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
here as I understand it house Ways and
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
Means have never looked at
 
03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
um the any of the fee structures that
 
03:52:17.090 --> 03:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
are in statute you've given us a portion
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the statute but you've not given us
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
the portion dealing with fees and it's
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
my understanding that Ways and Means of
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
the house has never looked at that part
 
03:52:31.370 --> 03:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
of the statute is that true
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's a fair statement yes all
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
right so with that
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
um why don't you walk us through the
 
03:52:38.640 --> 03:52:40.429 align:start position:0%
um why don't you walk us through the
revenues

03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
on the revenue side of the equation
 
03:52:45.170 --> 03:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
for a statute
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
who are required to assess certain
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
entities between 100 and 200 or 500 and
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
a thousand and
 
03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
the statute there's a floor
 
03:52:58.610 --> 03:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
the ones that are in the 100
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
bucket that's the 100 Floor
 
03:53:03.650 --> 03:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking which is approved by
 
03:53:04.729 --> 03:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
gel card
 
03:53:07.010 --> 03:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
we put a range in there between 100 and
 
03:53:07.020 --> 03:53:08.269 align:start position:0%
we put a range in there between 100 and
200

03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
200
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
the other bucket
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
which is the wholesalers manufacturers
 
03:53:13.790 --> 03:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
and bbms
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
there's a four or five hundred dollars
 
03:53:17.630 --> 03:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
and through rule making we made a
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
thousand that's the range we have to
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
play with
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
so by Statute we're required to send out
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
an invoice
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
for at least five hundred dollars So
 
03:53:30.650 --> 03:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
based upon the numbers the board was
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
able to ascertain again would trying to
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
get as much accurate information about
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and pbms and we went to
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy board and director Courtney
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
was very kind to try to help us identify
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
who has a pharmacy license or wholesale
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
license if you will in the state of New
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire their database could not pull
 
03:53:52.979 --> 03:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire their database could not pull
it

03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
repeat that they did basically not pull
 
03:53:56.580 --> 03:53:57.650 align:start position:0%
repeat that they did basically not pull
it

03:53:57.650 --> 03:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it's all commingled with different
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
entities that we could not necessify to
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
and in order for us to go through it
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's a very manual labor-intensive
 
03:54:08.690 --> 03:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
process so we went to
 
03:54:10.849 --> 03:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire Medicaid
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
which is the same as to get what they
 
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
call a label as number to identify the
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and wholesale as we have in
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the database and based upon that data we
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
assume which is a bad thing to do but
 
03:54:25.130 --> 03:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
that's the best we have
 
03:54:28.189 --> 03:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
that we'd have X number of entities that
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
would fall in each one of the buckets
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
and based upon that then we looked at
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to run the board and took the
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
cost divided by those number of entities
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
and come up with a assessment fee
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
so the ones that were in the 100 200
 
03:54:44.510 --> 03:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
bucket which is only the insurance
 
03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:45.590 align:start position:0%
bucket which is only the insurance
carriers

03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's 18 of them were assessed a
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
all the other ones were assessed at that
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
point in time seven hundred dollars
 
03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
based upon our
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
best guess at what's out there as far as
 
03:55:04.130 --> 03:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.750 --> 03:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
so what I was what I was looking for is
 
03:55:12.290 --> 03:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
that you're going to impose a fee
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to call them a tax from now
 
03:55:17.150 --> 03:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
on because as I'm reading uh the gel car
 
03:55:22.309 --> 03:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
minutes uh their uh gel car staff Kim
 
03:55:22.319 --> 03:55:23.809 align:start position:0%
minutes uh their uh gel car staff Kim
Reeve

03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
Reeve
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
um uh basically said so in looking at
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
the statute in the legislative history
 
03:55:33.130 --> 03:55:33.140 align:start position:0%
and the rule the fees might be
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because they appear not
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
to have a benefit associated with them
 
03:55:41.210 --> 03:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
to the entities paying the fees they're
 
03:55:43.490 --> 03:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
not fees for licenses they're not user
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
fees they aren't a tax on property
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
income they don't qualify as cost
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
recovery they appear to be a fee for
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire but the
 
03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
legislative history does not talk about
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the fees it's completely
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
silent and and this was all in response
 
03:56:05.450 --> 03:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
to a UNH Professor Marcus horn who had
 
03:56:08.530 --> 03:56:08.540 align:start position:0%
written ways and means in 2013
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the Constitutional
 
03:56:14.510 --> 03:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
authority to impose taxes by the
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislature was limited this that this
 
03:56:20.050 --> 03:56:20.060 align:start position:0%
peace structure appears to be
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional based on the people who
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
really had spent the most time looking
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
at it so so
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
um have I said anything that is
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
factually incorrect yes well please
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
correct me in PH I think it's one zero
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
zero I'll
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy board rules require that any
 
03:56:43.849 --> 03:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
manufacturer wholesaler has to be
 
03:56:48.250 --> 03:56:48.260 align:start position:0%
compliant all applicable state
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
laws that impact what they're doing so
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
in essence if the Board of Pharmacy will
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
not provide them a permit because
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
they're not complying with the
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
that in essence is a benefit to the
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
wholesaler as well as the manufacturer
 
03:57:05.150 --> 03:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
that's different than the pbms but the
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and manufacturers
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
buy Pharmacy rule are required to comply
 
03:57:13.849 --> 03:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
with those rules and those laws
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay so summarize I I think you said
 
03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:18.889 align:start position:0%
okay so summarize I I think you said
that

03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
the implication of what you said is that
 
03:57:24.530 --> 03:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
although your sheet shows some revenues
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
coming from manufacturers Distributors
 
03:57:30.130 --> 03:57:30.140 align:start position:0%
PDM and insurance carriers
 
03:57:33.410 --> 03:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
although gel car unanimously viewed
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
these as potentially unconstitutional
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
you think that there may be an exception
 
03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
to some of these fees being imposed and
 
03:57:44.570 --> 03:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's where I think having the
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
conversation on House Bill 172 will
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity to it so so which
 
03:57:51.650 --> 03:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
of those four categories do you think
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
still have a viable
 
03:57:55.729 --> 03:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and manufacturers or
 
03:57:55.739 --> 03:57:57.250 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and manufacturers or
Distributors

03:57:57.250 --> 03:57:57.260 align:start position:0%
Distributors
 
03:57:59.090 --> 03:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
Distributors sorry
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
you see Distributors and who else
 
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturers they're required to have a
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
permit by the Board of Pharmacy and the
 
03:58:07.610 --> 03:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy rule requires them
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
specifically to comply
 
03:58:13.010 --> 03:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
with rules that related to Business
 
03:58:13.020 --> 03:58:14.269 align:start position:0%
with rules that related to Business
Association

03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure I hate to replan on the ground that
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
the gel cars spent months looking at
 
03:58:21.530 --> 03:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
because this is not the first time that
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
they the fee issue came up with them
 
03:58:25.929 --> 03:58:25.939 align:start position:0%
right this is stuck on their third time
 
03:58:29.389 --> 03:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
there was we had a meeting with Mike
 
03:58:29.399 --> 03:58:30.349 align:start position:0%
there was we had a meeting with Mike
Morrow

03:58:30.349 --> 03:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
Morrow
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
and we brought up the issue that with
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys from uh gel car and
 
03:58:37.370 --> 03:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
there was some hesitation on their side
 
03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
it was not brought forward during the
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday I was told it's going
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.370 --> 03:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
um nothing is going to take a lot of
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
discussion and fortunately it did and I
 
03:58:49.250 --> 03:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
should have been there and I went
 
03:58:50.450 --> 03:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I wasn't
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the things that we
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
talked about is that if you look at the
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
pharmacy rule for the permit they don't
 
03:58:55.260 --> 03:58:56.570 align:start position:0%
pharmacy rule for the permit they don't
comply

03:58:56.570 --> 03:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
comply
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
then in essence the board cannot give
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
them a permit
 
03:59:02.330 --> 03:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
so representative Bill hatch who's a
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
member of gel Carr and of the greater
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee uh part of what he
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
said is I think most the staff is aware
 
03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
of my concern over fees as they come in
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that they're and that they're
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate because if he has directly
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
related to the cost of providing a
 
03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
service if it's not it's a tax and with
 
03:59:25.250 --> 03:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
this my head exploded about nine times
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
when I saw what was being assessed no 10
 
03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was in the hospital so it
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
was okay there's a little bit of humor
 
03:59:34.319 --> 03:59:34.910 align:start position:0%
was okay there's a little bit of humor
um

03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:37.849 --> 03:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
but has there been any attention paid to
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
that because the whole thing is just
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
upside down in my mind
 
03:59:47.150 --> 03:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
so so with that Mr Ripple do you have
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
um my hb2
 
03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:59:53.330 --> 03:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
so it's not in the form of a house bill
 
03:59:55.849 --> 03:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
2 Amendment but it is an amendment to
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 130 from representative font
 
04:00:00.170 --> 04:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's what you wanted me to handle yeah
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's hand that out and I'll
 
04:00:10.250 --> 04:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:10.260 --> 04:00:11.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:00:14.570 --> 04:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
do you have a question you go ahead Mike
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
of them of okay
 
04:00:20.929 --> 04:00:20.939 align:start position:0%
has any of this gotten off the ground at
 
04:00:22.610 --> 04:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
this point or is it still zero in the
 
04:00:24.410 --> 04:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
bank and nobody's been hired and no
 
04:00:26.570 --> 04:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
contracts have been let it's zero on the
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
banquet but this is at this point in
 
04:00:29.870 --> 04:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
time all the work is being done by the
 
04:00:31.130 --> 04:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
board is through the volunteer efforts
 
04:00:32.809 --> 04:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
of the board members themselves there's
 
04:00:35.090 --> 04:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
been no Personnel hired although I will
 
04:00:36.410 --> 04:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
say that the Department of Health and
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
Human Services has been very generous
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
with helping us try to administratively
 
04:00:42.050 --> 04:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
get some of the things done for on our
 
04:00:44.090 --> 04:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
behalf and when it's up and running what
 
04:00:45.889 --> 04:00:45.899 align:start position:0%
would the deliverable deliverables be
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we as the public would be able to
 
04:00:48.239 --> 04:00:51.370 align:start position:0%
that we as the public would be able to
see

04:00:51.370 --> 04:00:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the Public's point of view
 
04:00:56.929 --> 04:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
hopefully within the first 24 months of
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
the board is finding out how the
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
transparency if you will within the
 
04:01:02.450 --> 04:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
board and bringing back strategies
 
04:01:04.610 --> 04:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
I would say at this point in time it's
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
most likely in year three or four that
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
we can actually come back with some
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
concrete strategies to help the public
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
out I mean part of it too is one of the
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
things which is interesting is that
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
which is I don't understand but it's
 
04:01:16.920 --> 04:01:18.229 align:start position:0%
which is I don't understand but it's
reality

04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
reality
 
04:01:21.290 --> 04:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
all of our public payers don't use the
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
same PBM we don't leverage ourselves as
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
simple as that
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
we don't collectively knows the School
 
04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
departments use their own PBM the state
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
employees user pvms why are we breaking
 
04:01:37.130 --> 04:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
a small state and why not learning from
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
each other that's a simple step going
 
04:01:40.969 --> 04:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
forward but again back to your question
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
we really haven't had the resources to
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
get it up and running okay so part of
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
the delivery rules is the
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations that the board was
 
04:01:50.809 --> 04:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
making what we also able to see the data
 
04:01:52.189 --> 04:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
behind it that you're collecting the
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
pricing information you were talking
 
04:02:01.090 --> 04:02:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
help out here a lot of the data that
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would be sharing with the
 
04:02:08.450 --> 04:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
board is very confidential
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that would have to be retained by
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
the board but the aggregated data
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes let's the body could see so when you
 
04:02:17.090 --> 04:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
first sat down you started talking about
 
04:02:20.450 --> 04:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
I think um insulin yes we wouldn't
 
04:02:21.769 --> 04:02:21.779 align:start position:0%
actually see
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
what you just described about insulin
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
that would not come out of what we would
 
04:02:27.050 --> 04:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
see in in the aggregate I'm just trying
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out what level you're
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
aggregating is that the whole
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry gets aggregated
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
into a couple of numbers or is it per
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
drug or
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
it may be by class of drugs and the
 
04:02:40.130 --> 04:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
information I given to you from sanofi
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
and from Eli is from the them that's
 
04:02:44.030 --> 04:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
public data okay that's publicly
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
available thank you
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
I mean as I'm listening to you I'm
 
04:02:53.040 --> 04:02:54.170 align:start position:0%
I mean as I'm listening to you I'm
thinking

04:02:54.170 --> 04:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
that the state itself
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid Program
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
probably purchases
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
a huge share of the amount of
 
04:03:08.570 --> 04:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that are purchased in New
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it would seem that this
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
would provide for them a lot of valuable
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
information can you maybe expand a
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
little bit on my thinking am I
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
think am I correct because it would be
 
04:03:26.090 --> 04:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
very valuable to public
 
04:03:28.849 --> 04:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
to the state for the Medicaid system for
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
the state employees the counties
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts that
 
04:03:36.050 --> 04:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
make them if you basically I'm trying to
 
04:03:37.250 --> 04:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
get to is a
 
04:03:38.929 --> 04:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
educated buyer
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and understand how they should be going
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the marketplace and being and bring
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
to them a level of knowledge so they can
 
04:03:49.010 --> 04:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
negotiate on behalf of people in a way
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
that we can reduce the overall cost the
 
04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
cost doesn't have to be the unit price
 
04:03:55.729 --> 04:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
it has to go also with waste
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
um going from one high cost therapeutic
 
04:04:00.349 --> 04:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
to another one those are all things that
 
04:04:02.210 --> 04:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
we could work on collectively to bring
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
down the overall cost
 
04:04:07.210 --> 04:04:07.220 align:start position:0%
thank you yep representative
 
04:04:09.410 --> 04:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner hit my question
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
again about a savings to the state
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm Gonna Let You Go first next
 
04:04:13.080 --> 04:04:14.870 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm Gonna Let You Go first next
time

04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:04:14.880 --> 04:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
time
okay

04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.290 --> 04:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think I think I'm I'm ready to draw
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
attention to the amendment that we just
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
passed out so so let me give you a
 
04:04:28.610 --> 04:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
little context on this amendment
 
04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
um representative leishman also of this
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee and I submitted uh two
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
house bills that are in Commerce one was
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
HB 130 and the other was HB 172. you've
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about 172 but hb130
 
04:04:49.210 --> 04:04:49.220 align:start position:0%
these two bills together
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
hb130 was you know just kill the pdab
 
04:04:57.010 --> 04:04:57.020 align:start position:0%
just kill it the other one
 
04:05:00.490 --> 04:05:00.500 align:start position:0%
172 was kind of a more reasoned approach
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
saying that this statute is not cooked
 
04:05:08.689 --> 04:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
let's hold in a bands for a couple of
 
04:05:14.330 --> 04:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
years the fee and fine authority of the
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
board so that we can do a good
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
assessment on the level of redundancy
 
04:05:23.809 --> 04:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
that exists and figure out what a best
 
04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
practice might look like for us to to
 
04:05:29.889 --> 04:05:29.899 align:start position:0%
move forward to to to some extent
 
04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
represent a merchant you you're in favor
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the part of 172 that doesn't hold the
 
04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
hold the authority of the board in
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
advance but you're you sound like you're
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
open to an investigation of redundancies
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
and how we might work together based on
 
04:05:51.050 --> 04:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
existing programs and efforts I would
 
04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
say anytime the state can work more
 
04:05:56.210 --> 04:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
efficiently more effectively we should
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
consider that but while we're doing that
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
I would also say the board should
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
continue on its
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
journey in this mission to over to do
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to be doing and
 
04:06:07.250 --> 04:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's looking at transparency and
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
reducing overall cost the other thing
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
too when you're talking about if I may
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yeah about the
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
tax we had a bill before Health and
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services to take money from the
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
marriage license
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's not relevant and what they why is
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
it not relevant
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
um because we're working off a testimony
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
from jail cars saying this particular
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
fee structure is likely to be
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but that goes back to
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
the question that you're raising so what
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to is that when
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
someone pays their license forty three
 
04:06:42.050 --> 04:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
dollars of a 50 goes to another agency
 
04:06:46.250 --> 04:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
not true I don't find that relevant okay
 
04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
um so again we have in testimony the gel
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
car unanimous recommendation and the
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
transcript that led to it
 
04:06:59.150 --> 04:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 130 was a repeal of the
 
04:07:02.450 --> 04:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
entire statute but what representative
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hunt's Amendment does is it replaces all
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
of that repeal language with what is
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
before you
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
what I am proposing is that we take this
 
04:07:17.090 --> 04:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
language and we bring it into hb2
 
04:07:19.130 --> 04:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
so this is this is kind of one of our
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
first conversations about this what what
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
it does is it does to the outcome to you
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
what it does I'm just introducing the
 
04:07:31.010 --> 04:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
idea what it does is it does two things
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
it on line 10 and 11
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
takes the issue of are the fees
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or not it takes the
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we're granting a
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
highly autonomous board regulatory
 
04:07:46.849 --> 04:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
authority to demand information from the
 
04:07:48.650 --> 04:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
private sector and if they don't comply
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
the power to find them it takes all of
 
04:07:51.840 --> 04:07:52.610 align:start position:0%
the power to find them it takes all of
that

04:07:52.610 --> 04:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
out and just says this effort is going
 
04:07:59.210 --> 04:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
to be funded by the general funds so I I
 
04:08:02.809 --> 04:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
think I think that is pretty simple and
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
then lines 12 through 20 there was
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from AARP and from new Futures
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
saying that this was really a great idea
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
and that they'd like to see it funded so
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
what lines 12 through 20 do is it
 
04:08:22.250 --> 04:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
essentially establishes a dedicated fund
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
so that those interested parties who
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
believe this is a good idea have a
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
vehicle for donating their own money
 
04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
into supporting the budget so that's
 
04:08:34.969 --> 04:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
what the two things in this in this
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
amendment do that I would propose
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
putting into hb2 now if
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt is successful in
 
04:08:46.010 --> 04:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
getting 130 out of the Commerce
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
Committee with this amendment and it
 
04:08:51.410 --> 04:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
goes and passes the house we can always
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
pull it out of hb2 because I don't I
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe in the belt and
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
suspender thing if you don't need to do
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's my proposal
 
04:09:02.090 --> 04:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative walner do you have a
 
04:09:02.100 --> 04:09:04.309 align:start position:0%
representative walner do you have a
comment

04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know I think you just answered it
 
04:09:08.450 --> 04:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
because I I wanted to know where one
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
third I knew it was in Commerce but I
 
04:09:12.110 --> 04:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know what its fate had been
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
whether it was still alive whether it
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
had been amended what it happened very
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
much alive uh representative hunt what
 
04:09:21.410 --> 04:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
he's told me
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
is that uh he's got a handshake deal
 
04:09:29.809 --> 04:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
with his uh minority partner that if
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
they ever get to the point in Commerce
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
of recognizing that there's a 10 10
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
split on a bill they'll retain it
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
and so he's been thinking
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
that this is likely to be 10 10 on on
 
04:09:45.010 --> 04:09:45.020 align:start position:0%
party lines
 
04:09:49.010 --> 04:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
but what's new is Friday gel car came
 
04:09:50.650 --> 04:09:50.660 align:start position:0%
out unanimously
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
saying that the the fees were an issue
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that just makes this
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
amendment for representative hunt and
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
130 prescient because it it sort of
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
Rises to the occasion raised by gel car
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.570 --> 04:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead so let me ask you this if
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment doesn't
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
if Commerce decides not to accept this
 
04:10:17.220 --> 04:10:20.330 align:start position:0%
if Commerce decides not to accept this
amendment

04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
when we then continue to attempt to put
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.689 --> 04:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
so so I think it depends you know we we
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
as kind of an interesting one when we're
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
talking in committee but if Commerce uh
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
ends up hung up on a 10-10 vote and they
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
choose to retain it I think we still
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
have uh independent action without being
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
biased by their vote nor informed
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
neither biased nor informed by their
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
vote to push this into hb2 based on our
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
own interpretation of the jail car
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
caution to have the legislature review
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
the fees
 
04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
so so I I'm I'm ready to you know talk
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
about this and uh get it we don't have
 
04:11:10.729 --> 04:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
to vote on hb2 today but I just don't
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
04:11:15.050 --> 04:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
um hiding anything from division three
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that that's my intent is to
 
04:11:21.229 --> 04:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate the unconstitutional tax
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
structure that's in current statute and
 
04:11:28.010 --> 04:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
replace it with the general funds to
 
04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
support an approved budget
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
and to allow the creation of a dedicated
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
fund so that those members of the
 
04:11:38.330 --> 04:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
community who are passionate about this
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
can put their own money into it
 
04:11:41.100 --> 04:11:42.710 align:start position:0%
can put their own money into it
so

04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a question
 
04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:49.130 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a question
um

04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:51.050 --> 04:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
looking at a new
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
use the word Distributors and
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would be the ones that you
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe can pay into this I assume this
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't started yet
 
04:12:01.969 --> 04:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
all right that
 
04:12:05.090 --> 04:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
no funds have come in yet and okay I'm
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
gonna just confirm that
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and we've also heard that
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
AARP and new Futures think this this is
 
04:12:16.510 --> 04:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
a great idea is there any feedback from
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
any of the groups that would be paying
 
04:12:22.729 --> 04:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
these fees as to
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
their Acceptance non-acceptance in my
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm just looking at it we talk
 
04:12:30.050 --> 04:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
about buckets those look like drops in a
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
bucket for these organizations what
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
during the board meetings and so forth
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
we did hear from Pharma the
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturing company
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
they were not concerned about the fees
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
what they were concerned about is
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the information and
 
04:12:49.620 --> 04:12:50.450 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the information and
we

04:12:50.450 --> 04:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
modified the rules to accommodate their
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
concerns over the confidentiality that
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
was addressed but we have not heard from
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
Pharma I mean from Pharma and the
 
04:13:00.769 --> 04:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
manufacturers orphans Distributors the
 
04:13:02.150 --> 04:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
only ones we've heard from is the
 
04:13:04.370 --> 04:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
and and just to
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on that and you said that
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
their share is a hundred dollars
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
correct two hundred dollars correct
 
04:13:17.689 --> 04:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
and there's only 18 of them
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
thank you but then there are others that
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
are paying 500 so it's it's a bit Yeah
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
tiered representative Waller
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
so you've seen the amendment I don't
 
04:13:30.769 --> 04:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
know if you'd seen the amendment before
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
we came today
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes I have and
 
04:13:38.210 --> 04:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea of how the board
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
would feel about this amendment what
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
would the board think about this I can't
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
speak for the board because we didn't
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
talk about it at the board collectively
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
um there may be some reluctance on the
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
board part of it is inside of here is
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
not trying to pin it down but
 
04:14:04.370 --> 04:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
if we're looking for the general fund to
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
fund it there's nothing here requires
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
any dollars so every single year we go
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
through a budget cycle
 
04:14:12.110 --> 04:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're constantly going through a process
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
and trying to understand do we have any
 
04:14:17.150 --> 04:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
money to do the job or not
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing in here to
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
specifies it's going to be a quarter of
 
04:14:21.290 --> 04:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
a million and a half million if you want
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
to put them a half million dollars in
 
04:14:24.769 --> 04:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
there and it stays that way I think the
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
board would probably live with it but
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
right now there's nothing in this
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't the part that says you can raise
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
it no you're right the the part that
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
says you can raise 125 percent of your
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
approved budget would be stricken by
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
um but the problem you just said that
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
you would have to worry from budget to
 
04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
budget how much money you're going to
 
04:14:51.660 --> 04:14:52.309 align:start position:0%
budget how much money you're going to
get

04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:14:54.530 --> 04:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
you just describe our entire state
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
budget every every Department what I
 
04:15:00.010 --> 04:15:00.020 align:start position:0%
mean what makes this department
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
exceptional to the point
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
where we should permit
 
04:15:07.490 --> 04:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
a probably unconscious I mean the
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
industry doesn't care about whether
 
04:15:10.969 --> 04:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
something's constitutional or not that's
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
our job if this is an unconstitutional
 
04:15:13.620 --> 04:15:14.950 align:start position:0%
our job if this is an unconstitutional
tax

04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh why why should this board be held out
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
as something special and unique
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
if the comment about the
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of the tax versus
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
the fee was never raised by the Pharma
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
was now raised by the wholesalers
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Distributors the only entities that
 
04:15:34.729 --> 04:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
raised the issue with the insurance
 
04:15:34.739 --> 04:15:35.929 align:start position:0%
raised the issue with the insurance
carriers

04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
so well in the legislature in the
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislator and and the legislature's
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
product I don't mean to argue with you
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.769 --> 04:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill passed in
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
2020. 2020. and at that time was there
 
04:16:01.309 --> 04:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
any discussion about the fee
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
and unconstitutionality of it no matter
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
of fact if I may take a second
 
04:16:08.330 --> 04:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Waller it never was
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
discussed even a jail card came in
 
04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
literally of the 11th Hour 59th minute
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
15 minutes before the jail card meeting
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's when it and that had been around
 
04:16:19.330 --> 04:16:19.340 align:start position:0%
since 2013.
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
so as we mentioned earlier in the
 
04:16:23.570 --> 04:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
legislative history this bill has never
 
04:16:26.210 --> 04:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
been to Ways and Means and Ways and
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
Means is typically the subject matter
 
04:16:31.849 --> 04:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
expert on the constitutionality of taxes
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
and fees that's the sort of their
 
04:16:35.929 --> 04:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so this bill has the
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
statute is bypassed subject matter
 
04:16:40.370 --> 04:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
experts and Ways and Means and in
 
04:16:43.250 --> 04:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
finance in previous years so so that's
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's kind of one of the issues that
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative leishman and I have had
 
04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
when this first came in front of the
 
04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal Committee in January of last year
 
04:16:51.060 --> 04:16:52.309 align:start position:0%
fiscal Committee in January of last year
so

04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:55.250 --> 04:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards again with House
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 130 I would make the strong
 
04:17:00.050 --> 04:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we pull it into
 
04:17:02.510 --> 04:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 172 and talk about this issue
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
collectively and not try to do it
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
piecemeal that we look at various issues
 
04:17:09.769 --> 04:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
that stakeholders have raised and we do
 
04:17:09.779 --> 04:17:11.450 align:start position:0%
that stakeholders have raised and we do
it

04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
in a sense of holding stakeholder
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
Community because to deal with one piece
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
of it versus somebody else I think the
 
04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
legislative body would be better off if
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
we all come together
 
04:17:22.729 --> 04:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
collectively and talk about the
 
04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
respective issues and how we can resolve
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
it with a bill versus trying to go back
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
time and time again to fix something
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
because we didn't take the time on front
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
end to do it correctly so both 130 and
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
172 belong to representative hunt in his
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
committee so uh a division three in
 
04:17:41.090 --> 04:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
finance can only do with what we have in
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
front of us is it that's why I think
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
this language that Commerce is going to
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
consider is for this amendment is is
 
04:17:52.610 --> 04:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
great material for hb2 but that that's
 
04:17:54.110 --> 04:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
my perspective
 
04:17:54.120 --> 04:17:55.610 align:start position:0%
my perspective
so

04:17:55.610 --> 04:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:55.620 --> 04:17:57.229 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:59.210 --> 04:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
so rather than taking any kind of a
 
04:18:01.370 --> 04:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
straw vote on that and because this is
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
the first time that several of the
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
members have seen it I I I'm just going
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
to leave it with you because we'll have
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
time to discuss it when we talk about
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
hb2 more in the future but I just want
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
you to know that I want to end the
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of an unconstitutional tax
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I want to end the authority of this
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
board to autonomously issue fines if
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't get the information they want
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the time that they want from the
 
04:18:34.929 --> 04:18:34.939 align:start position:0%
private sector that is a extreme
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
Authority that I think is too onerous to
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
to leave in an independent board's hands
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be accountable
 
04:18:46.010 --> 04:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
all right so let's uh let's start
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
getting into your budget
 
04:18:50.570 --> 04:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
I think you want to hire two people I
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
want I think you want to hire an
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
executive director at a base salary of
 
04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
118 000 and you want to hire an
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant for
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um over forty five thousand is that
 
04:19:02.760 --> 04:19:03.769 align:start position:0%
um over forty five thousand is that
correct

04:19:03.769 --> 04:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
and that's correct
 
04:19:09.530 --> 04:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr White and the budget proposal
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
that that the change proposal you would
 
04:19:18.170 --> 04:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
submit I see on page 1085 uh
 
04:19:21.530 --> 04:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions I see one would
 
04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
would would the
 
04:19:27.050 --> 04:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
with the change proposal reflecting this
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
have one and one so for a total of two
 
04:19:31.199 --> 04:19:32.750 align:start position:0%
have one and one so for a total of two
the

04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:34.849 --> 04:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh essentially we'd have to create a
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
class 10 for the classified
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant uh the total
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
of all the payroll lines is 242 thousand
 
04:19:58.920 --> 04:20:00.590 align:start position:0%
of all the payroll lines is 242 thousand
dollars

04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:20:00.600 --> 04:20:02.510 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's nearly a quarter million dollars
 
04:20:09.290 --> 04:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
do you want to explain what these folks
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
would be doing that adds a quarter
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars of value to the taxpayer
 
04:20:17.570 --> 04:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
yes the executive director's
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to work with all the
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
other state agencies as I mentioned
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
before is how to weave it together
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
to take
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
the various resources we have within the
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
state so we don't have redundancy that
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
we can actually at that point in time
 
04:20:32.689 --> 04:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
leverage what we do have so the
 
04:20:34.010 --> 04:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
executive director is going to be
 
04:20:37.309 --> 04:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for being the liaison to all
 
04:20:39.170 --> 04:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
the other state agencies to find out
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
where we can benefit collectively so we
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
again back to that word redundancy that
 
04:20:48.110 --> 04:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
we try to minimize that number two it's
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
also working if with other folks another
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
pdas throughout the country try to
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledge there learn themselves
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones going to be
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
really tasked with understanding a black
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
box it's a lot of research a lot of
 
04:21:00.779 --> 04:21:01.849 align:start position:0%
box it's a lot of research a lot of
understanding

04:21:01.849 --> 04:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:21:04.370 --> 04:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
the administrative person is not so much
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
there to help them but help coordinate
 
04:21:07.610 --> 04:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
the things like
 
04:21:09.650 --> 04:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
are we getting the license fees are we
 
04:21:11.689 --> 04:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
getting the registrations in on time are
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
we getting things the the data requested
 
04:21:16.250 --> 04:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
by the board is it coming
 
04:21:18.530 --> 04:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
forward is the advisory Council up and
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
setting as it up and running I mean
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's it's administratively helping
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
them so we don't pay somebody who's an
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
executive director to do administrative
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
work their role really is to be the
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
captain of the ship and work with all
 
04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
the other facets of our state government
 
04:21:33.889 --> 04:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
along with
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
the industry itself to begin to become
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable about the black box
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
and bring transparency to us sure so if
 
04:21:43.250 --> 04:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
you had this money on one July
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
and given the workforce issues in the
 
04:21:45.420 --> 04:21:46.370 align:start position:0%
and given the workforce issues in the
state

04:21:46.370 --> 04:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
what do you think it would take for you
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
to get these people identified and hired
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
one when would you need to start paying
 
04:21:52.140 --> 04:21:55.429 align:start position:0%
one when would you need to start paying
them

04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
wishful thinking would be that I would
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
have somebody on board July 1 the
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
reality is most likely not the
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
individual that we're looking for and
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
the unique knowledge that they would
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
require would probably be wouldn't be
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
until sometime into the fall see I'm not
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
a lawyer but I don't even know if you
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
can post a position until it's been
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
approved and this budget in the earliest
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
is going to be approved sometime in June
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
so so do you think you could have it
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's the question do you think you
 
04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
could really have it posted if you
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know all right so there's
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
probably a higher lag in here most
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
likely it's going to be some degree of
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
higher lag in there yes okay so
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
um The Contract Services
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
133.5 what is that for is that one
 
04:22:51.769 --> 04:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
contract or multiple contracts it's
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
predominantly one contractor we reached
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
out again this has to go through an RFP
 
04:22:58.250 --> 04:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh it has to go through GNC
 
04:22:59.809 --> 04:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be a process we're
 
04:23:01.250 --> 04:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
looking to reach out to the University
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they're doing work now
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
with the Department Health Human
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
Services to analyze some of the data so
 
04:23:08.570 --> 04:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're trying to see if we can build off
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
in that contract without having to
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
create another one but again it has to
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
go through the rfe process
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
so the contract Service is looking at
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
helping us develop a methodology so once
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
we begin to understand what's in the
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
black box is then how do you start
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
developing methodology
 
04:23:26.689 --> 04:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
to develop the strategies and the
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
methodology we create because this can
 
04:23:31.370 --> 04:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized it has to be able to
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
withstand the scrutiny of people and
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
entities looking at it so if we set a
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
spending Target it has to be both upon
 
04:23:37.920 --> 04:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
spending Target it has to be both upon
sound

04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
sound
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
information sound process and that's
 
04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
where you need to bring consultants in
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
who have
 
04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
the knowledge in this space to do it and
 
04:23:48.530 --> 04:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
help the board out it's not to do so
 
04:23:50.030 --> 04:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
much the data analysis but help us
 
04:23:51.650 --> 04:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
understanding how do we use the data to
 
04:23:53.090 --> 04:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
develop the targets we have to set
 
04:23:55.610 --> 04:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
within the statute so so is there a
 
04:23:58.490 --> 04:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
deliverable or is the deliverable in
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
this case advice and a support and
 
04:24:03.889 --> 04:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
basically an extension of the subject
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
matter expertise of the two people the
 
04:24:06.479 --> 04:24:07.729 align:start position:0%
matter expertise of the two people the
deliverable

04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
deliverable
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
one of the deliverables is helping us to
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
find a methodology to create a spending
 
04:24:12.540 --> 04:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
find a methodology to create a spending
Target

04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
Target
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
because that's a Nostalgia is we have to
 
04:24:18.650 --> 04:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
be able to go to different public payers
 
04:24:20.090 --> 04:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
and saying we think this is a reasonable
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
spending Target
 
04:24:26.150 --> 04:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
so so would that work wait until your
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the other state
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
agencies took place and we've figured
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
out what the redundancies were I mean
 
04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
are are you ready to sing today that
 
04:24:38.570 --> 04:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
that's what you need in that deliverable
 
04:24:40.729 --> 04:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
I would say I need to hire somebody to
 
04:24:42.410 --> 04:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
help us understand it because right now
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
we at the mercy of volunteers we don't
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
have the time to really get into it if
 
04:24:48.050 --> 04:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
we put something into the budget because
 
04:24:49.610 --> 04:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
we do realize that we have to have
 
04:24:51.650 --> 04:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
contracts with people to be able to do
 
04:24:51.660 --> 04:24:52.550 align:start position:0%
contracts with people to be able to do
the

04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:55.490 --> 04:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay legal services in year One what
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
kind of legal services are you well I
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
put that in because I wasn't sure about
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:25:03.410 --> 04:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
as far as DHHS and mou is do we have to
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse maybe we don't back to the
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
AG's office the AG's office says the
 
04:25:09.889 --> 04:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
attorney that helps support us so do we
 
04:25:11.210 --> 04:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
as an entity like we do the department
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
of health Team services do we have to
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
pay back to the AG's office where the
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
legal services we use for them
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
so let's say you do and and that if you
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
needed to it was it this is a fine place
 
04:25:24.250 --> 04:25:24.260 align:start position:0%
for it but what legal services do you
 
04:25:27.530 --> 04:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
anticipate in Year One
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
when we go through rule making like we
 
04:25:30.769 --> 04:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
did last time is helping us understand
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
we do rulemaking
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
is guide us from a legal point of view
 
04:25:37.130 --> 04:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
because this is jail car basically
 
04:25:38.809 --> 04:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
helping you navigate jail car it could
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
be jail cards helping us navigate the
 
04:25:42.290 --> 04:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
mou with the Department of Health and
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
services navigating any contract we have
 
04:25:47.630 --> 04:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
say for um the University of New
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this the business side of
 
04:25:51.170 --> 04:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
the equation but this legal side of the
 
04:25:53.210 --> 04:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
equation so you have a contract you have
 
04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
to have a contract based upon the
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
business business principles but you
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to also have an attorney to look at
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
it from a legal protection point of view
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay subscriptions ten thousand dollars
 
04:26:04.610 --> 04:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
that is for the what they call medi-span
 
04:26:08.689 --> 04:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's a database medispan medicine okay
 
04:26:10.130 --> 04:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's a database
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay who do you rent that from and do
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know 10 000 is the right number
 
04:26:17.689 --> 04:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
um based upon what
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
we heard from the Department of Health
 
04:26:21.170 --> 04:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and people within the
 
04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
department that's what they advised us
 
04:26:28.490 --> 04:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
would you spell that m m a d i i I'm not
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'm dyslexic are you getting it
 
04:26:31.760 --> 04:26:33.530 align:start position:0%
I'm dyslexic are you getting it
s-p-a-n

04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
s-p-a-n
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's one of it it's it's a way for us to
 
04:26:39.410 --> 04:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
go into public data to find out what is
 
04:26:41.450 --> 04:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
out there for pricing and so forth to
 
04:26:43.130 --> 04:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
help guide the board when it's doing its
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
work okay you got 50
 
04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
000 for dhh oh I missed the white
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
speaker that one mou do you want to
 
04:26:51.649 --> 04:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
speak to them that's why absolutely
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
um in RSA 21g10 uh it indicates that um
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
when the department provides support and
 
04:26:59.689 --> 04:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
services to any administratively
 
04:27:02.210 --> 04:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
attached board we use a cost allocation
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
system we base this number based on
 
04:27:05.809 --> 04:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
prior experience with other
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
administratively attached boards based
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
on the level of servicing that we were
 
04:27:09.239 --> 04:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
on the level of servicing that we were
projecting

04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
in that case should that 10 000 Legal
 
04:27:19.250 --> 04:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
Services be included in that mou number
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
I wasn't involved in the development of
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
this budget so I think I need to have an
 
04:27:25.370 --> 04:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
offline conversation to understand what
 
04:27:27.170 --> 04:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
assumptions were made there okay so
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
you'll have that assumption clarified
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
when you do your change request correct
 
04:27:31.020 --> 04:27:33.290 align:start position:0%
when you do your change request correct
okay

04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:33.300 --> 04:27:38.570 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
was was there in the in the governor's
 
04:27:44.570 --> 04:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
budget there was uh travel money I don't
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
see travel money here I see an education
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
slash conference for 4 000.
 
04:27:52.370 --> 04:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
oh wait a second where's that what page
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.199 --> 04:28:04.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:28:04.370 --> 04:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.380 --> 04:28:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
the one that was submitted I skipped
 
04:28:14.290 --> 04:28:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:17.929 --> 04:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
I see it that was my error education
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
conference was what's that it that's
 
04:28:23.090 --> 04:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
basically for somebody to
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
either continue their education they
 
04:28:26.809 --> 04:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
could be going to a conference
 
04:28:28.729 --> 04:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
um knowledge sharing
 
04:28:31.130 --> 04:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
professionals have a but there's not an
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
identified conference well I'd leave it
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
up to the the individual if it's hired
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
to decide which one they should be going
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
to and not try to micromanage it
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
okay so I think
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
I understand your revenue and your
 
04:28:51.410 --> 04:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
expenses are there any questions on the
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
very first budget proposal presented by
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you very
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for being here
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I have not and I'm not familiar with
 
04:29:08.090 --> 04:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 hyphen BB colon 2. but are there
 
04:29:10.610 --> 04:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements from your board
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:29:21.050 --> 04:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
not per se reporting requirements that
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're probably thinking about what we
 
04:29:24.649 --> 04:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
are required to do is with set annually
 
04:29:26.689 --> 04:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
a spending Target which in essence is a
 
04:29:26.699 --> 04:29:27.530 align:start position:0%
a spending Target which in essence is a
report

04:29:27.530 --> 04:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we have to at that point in time for
 
04:29:32.450 --> 04:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
the public payers give them a Target and
 
04:29:34.010 --> 04:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we think is a
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
reasonable for you to be spending
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
so that's required in the statute but
 
04:29:41.330 --> 04:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that came out I
 
04:29:43.729 --> 04:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
want to talk about House Bill 172 I
 
04:29:44.929 --> 04:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
think to your point representative
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
Mooney is that the department Health
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight committees
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
probably the board should go back to
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
04:29:53.809 --> 04:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
and provide some updates to the to that
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
oversight committee whether it be done
 
04:29:58.010 --> 04:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
annually or
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
every six months I mean it's up for the
 
04:30:01.130 --> 04:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
discussion with the legislative body
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious on page 20
 
04:30:13.269 --> 04:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
no that's 19 of um the the Commissioners
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
slide deck
 
04:30:19.010 --> 04:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
the last bullet the purpose of the board
 
04:30:22.250 --> 04:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
is to identify I'm just curious who the
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
author of that paragraph is is that in
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
statute or is that uh ad hoc
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that was based off of what was
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
in statute I don't think we yes based on
 
04:30:34.080 --> 04:30:35.450 align:start position:0%
in statute I don't think we yes based on
statute

04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:30:38.330 --> 04:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
so this if I went to the statute this is
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
a quote
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
or or somebody took the statute and
 
04:30:48.290 --> 04:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
it is partly a quote what you'll see
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
within the parentheses there any
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
division state county or otherwise
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
um that section is not a direct citation
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
of 126 bb5 Roman 1A but the remainder of
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
that statement is
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
who who wrote who wrote this um uh this
 
04:31:18.290 --> 04:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
was prepared by my team by your team yes
 
04:31:18.300 --> 04:31:19.670 align:start position:0%
was prepared by my team by your team yes
okay

04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
so why would they add words to the
 
04:31:25.010 --> 04:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
statute that didn't exist I'm assuming
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
what they were doing and I can verify
 
04:31:30.170 --> 04:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
this in a second was using the public
 
04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
pair definition from 126 bb1 Roman 6 and
 
04:31:36.769 --> 04:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
and they inserted the public pair
 
04:31:40.610 --> 04:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
definition there okay all right well so
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
those are my questions before we finish
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is are there any questions from the
 
04:31:45.120 --> 04:31:46.490 align:start position:0%
this is are there any questions from the
committee

04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh represent Waller I just have one for
 
04:31:51.649 --> 04:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchant
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
what what kind of qualifications are you
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
um the qualifications has to be at least
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
the Master's Degree preferably some
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
other doctorates somebody has worked in
 
04:32:05.929 --> 04:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy supply chain is
 
04:32:08.410 --> 04:32:08.420 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in the space
 
04:32:08.420 --> 04:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in the space
the

04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
one who's running the Maryland Board is
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
both an attorney and a pharmacist
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so the qualifications that we're
 
04:32:18.889 --> 04:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
looking for are relatively High
 
04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
so it's both not just the educational
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
side of the equation which is going to
 
04:32:23.570 --> 04:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
be important
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
but more importantly the knowledge they
 
04:32:27.530 --> 04:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
have of the pharmacy supply chains so we
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't start from scratch that they can
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
basically hit the ground running
 
04:32:33.649 --> 04:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:33.659 --> 04:32:35.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
um again parting parting words for us
 
04:32:39.530 --> 04:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
because we're about to wrap on this for
 
04:32:39.540 --> 04:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
because we're about to wrap on this for
now

04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
I just want to thank the committee for
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
your time
 
04:32:46.729 --> 04:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
um if you have any questions about the
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
board or anything to do with the budget
 
04:32:50.809 --> 04:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
and self-worth by all means feel free to
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
call me I think the mission of the board
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
is something we should embrace we may
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about how to get there
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
but I think overall what I've heard time
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
and time again from most stakeholders as
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
well as most legislators is the intent
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
and the mission of the board is
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.570 --> 04:33:13.580 align:start position:0%
all right with that uh we're going to
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
adjourn the division three work session
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
on the department
 
04:33:23.929 --> 04:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
and we're about to go into a joint
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
session with division one to discuss
 
04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:29.689 align:start position:0%
session with division one to discuss
hb49

04:33:29.689 --> 04:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
so this would be a good time to take a
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
quick break while division one shuffles
 
04:33:33.480 --> 04:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
quick break while division one shuffles
in
