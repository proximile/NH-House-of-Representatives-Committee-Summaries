00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone and welcome
 
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
to science technology and energy for the
 
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
last Monday of January 2025 we'll begin
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
this morning as is our custom by all
 
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
rising and joining representative Rita

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
i al to the of the United States of
 
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which
 
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.350 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which
stands

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
all all right once again good morning
 
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
everyone I'm representative Michael Bose
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee and we're have a
 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
full day of public hearings to get to
 
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll start those in just a moment
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
but first I wanted to bring the
 
00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
committee up to date last week at this
 
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
time when we met uh I think I explained
 
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
or informed you that we had 22
 
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
bills to deal with well about three days
 
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
later that number jumped from 22 to
 
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
43 so we doubled the number of bills
 
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
that got assigned to us uh just last
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
week so we are going to have a very busy
 
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
month month
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
ahead I have tentatively scheduled all
 
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
the bills and we can actually finish all
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
the public hearings by the 3rd of March
 
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
according to the schedule I've put
 
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
together now that depends on the fact or
 
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 align:start position:0%
or the the the luck that we won't have
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
any days cancelled by snow or that um
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
there won't be some other kind
 
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
of event emergency or whatever that
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
prevents us from meeting but
 
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
if uh if all goes well we should be able
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
to finish public hearings on all the
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
bills by the 3D of March the first
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
Monday of March we will sprinkle in some
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
executive sessions along the way
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
to get bills done and on their way to
 
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.509 align:start position:0%
to get bills done and on their way to
the

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
clerk we will have an executive session
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning on three bills bills
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
two of which we're hearing today I
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
believe and uh that will give us a total
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
of six bills on the house calendar for
 
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
the first session of 2025 2026 which
 
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
will be Thursday February
 
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
6th does anyone have any questions about
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh our status going forward seeing none
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay let's open a public hearing then I
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on on House Bill
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
189 and call to
 
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
the testimony table Vice chair
 
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas the prime
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor of House Bill 189 which defines
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy and the department of
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
Energy's 10-year estate energy strategy
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
to include new technology smallscale
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy renewable energy and fuel
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
diversity and removing references to the
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
board representative
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh thank you uh Mr chairman good
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
morning uh to you and to members of
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy uh my name
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
is representative Doug Thomas I
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham County 16 which is
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
Londoner this bill is very simple uh the
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of this bill is to include
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear in the definition of clean
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
energy uh this is something that many
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
states have already done
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh I've already checked and seen that
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
even the states of New York and Colorado
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
have legisl legislation pending to
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
include nuclear technology in their in
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
their version definition of uh clean
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
energy so it's time that New Hampshire
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
does that as well and one of the reasons
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
why we want to do this uh obviously uh
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy does not emit any CO2
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
emissions but the other reason is to
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
give notice to potential investors that
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is open uh the market is
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
open to any type of nuclear technology
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
that they may seem fit to come in here
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that we want
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
them to know this and we want to make
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
sure that there are no barriers that
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
would prevent any marketing company from
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
coming in here and seeing if they can do
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
business here involving the new type of
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
nuclear technology so with that said um
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
that would have been all I had to say
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
except that uh when I went to the OS and
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
the lawyer to tell them my goal
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
they decided to put the definition of
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
clean energy
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
into section one chapter 21 of the state
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
rsas which is a huge compilation of
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
General definitions of various things
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
and so the definition of clean energy
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
was put into a new added uh chapter
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
55 which would be easy to find the
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
follows chapter 54 which is a definition
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
of gender identity uh but you can see
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
how everything mixes in there in doing
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
so and I had a conversation with the
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
Department of of energy we discovered
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
that inadvertently they had combined
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear and fuel diversity under the
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy which was not
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
my original intent so I have prepared an
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
202-7710 12 P colon 7 C where uh it will
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
say clean energy and fuel diversity so
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
as to not mix the two
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
together uh with that being said that
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
was the sole purpose of this bill uh
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
I'll answer questions involving that I'm
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
done thank you representative questions
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the representative representative
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh just a
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
clarification when you say small scale
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear I don't really how that's
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
defined are you talking about smrs here
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
small modular reactors or is it anything
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
of any size that's small and what how do
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
you define small well my my uh thought
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
was looking at the Practical aspects of
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
it that small scale nuclear technology
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
is the new nuclear technology of the
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
future and that's what I felt was a
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh thing to put into the
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy um that's
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
because you know practically speaking I
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to be doing any
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
large scale like Seabrook again followup
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah the reason I bring it up
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
because with smrs you could be looking
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
at let's just say uh a 10 megawatt uh
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
plant so that's going to be small scale
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
but you can also look at 10 megawatts
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
times five in the same location which
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
would be is that small scale I'm just
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
not sure we're defining the term clear
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
enough to say small scale should be you
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
know less than 100 megawatts uh if it's
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
if it's you're talking about smrs were
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
going to be manufactured remotely for
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
the most part so you might have a site
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
where they put in two five megawatt
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
plants and then five years later they
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
decide let's put in three more does that
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
then not become a small scale I just
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to tone Define that a
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
little bit better what wasn't my
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
intention to go to that much detail my
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
intention was just to include nuclear
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you uh
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
um nuclear waste is anything but clean
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
um in our field trip to seab Brook we
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
saw they have an entire building to
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
house spent nuclear waste so how is this
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
addressed under your definition of clean
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
energy again it was only to put the fact
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
that nuclear is clean energy the EU has
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
included nuclear in their definition of
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
clean energy so has so have many other
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
countries uh we this does not speak to
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
how we store it uh which incidentally
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
the storage of nuclear waste at Seabrook
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
is very small area very deep underground
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
but that's not the purpose of this bill
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
this purpose of the bill was just to put
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear as a definition of clean energy
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that when we talk about clean energy
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't omit nuclear as potential
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
possibilities how we handle it how we
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
store it would be matter for another
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.230 align:start position:0%
store it would be matter for another
business

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
followup sorry I I saw your arm
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGee and thought it was
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
her raising her hand again actually
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan had his his hand
 
00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.710 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan had his his hand
up

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair I just have a
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
quick question um and I appreciate the
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I I think that's a a wise
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh does the term clean energy
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
occur in any of the other statutes
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
relating to you know energy or utilities
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I know we have renewable energy
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
like as we have the renewable energy
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
standard and stuff but does the term
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
clean energy is there any other program
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
associated with that definition that you
 
00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
associated with that definition that you
know

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
of uh there
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
are sprinkled throughout the
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
rsas references to something being clean
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
energy um for a particular program but
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the rsas is there a
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
definition uh and that's why I was
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
spitting uh this bill so because of that
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill was submitted but
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
there are but there are our references
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
to programs when they speak of say
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
renewable as clean energy that's how
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's addressed there but it's not really
 
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
defined until this bill came
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
along okay representative McGee thank
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
question um I'm wondering if we're going
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
to be defining clean energy in that list
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I went and looked it up it's
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
really general terms um of statutory
 
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
construction related to statutory
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
construction so I'm not sure if it is
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate for it to be there but if OS
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
thinks that that's a good place for
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
definitions I'm wondering if we could
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
Define clean energy as non-greenhouse
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
gas emitting sources of energy so that
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're clear we're not identifying
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
individuals we're not limiting it in
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
terms of future Technologies but we're
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
simply saying that if it's not
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
contributing to the problem of
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that
 
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
we would consider it clean for those
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
purposes we don't have to call out
 
00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:13.629 align:start position:0%
purposes we don't have to call out
specific

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
Technologies um and maybe if we if we
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
could come to an agreement on what the
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
definition should be then it would be
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know um easier for anybody reading
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
the statute to understand what we meant
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
because clean energy doesn't appear to
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
be defined anywhere else and it looks
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
like this bill is trying to put a
 
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
like this bill is trying to put a
definition

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
there well the uh what the impetus
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
behind this was in the 12p chapter which
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
is comes under the uh energy 10 years
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
strategy plan they had a subsection in
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
energy uh such as Renewables and then
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
they and then they added uh fuel
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
diversity so my intent was to add
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
nuclear to that portion so we so nuclear
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
would be included for in investors to
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
see but when I spoke to the lawyer at at
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
OS and asked me what was my intent I
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
said my intent was just to include
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear as clean energy I wasn't
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about any other definition I
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to include nuclear in there
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's when he decided to put it up into
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
you know chapter 55 of chapter 21 I
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
guess uh so any additional definition I
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
guess you could come forward with W with
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
an idea and we can certainly discuss
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
it so just to to put a button on it or a
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
pin on it I don't know what what the
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
right metaphor is
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
um if we're defining clean energy my
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
opinion is we should and I'm a
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this it should be as broad
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
as possible and then when it comes to
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
amending 12 p7 A1C which is um where the
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
list is of what's included um I don't
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
have any problem uh having clean energy
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
and fuel diversity listed there and if
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
clean energy is defined as
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
non-greenhouse gas emitting sources of
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
energy then it would include nuclear and
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
um by definition um and it would be in
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
the list for the 10-year strategy report
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we would want anything in that
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
category to be reported on when the
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
10-year strategy report comes out so
 
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking to list it
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly and I'm saying does it make
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
sense if we're defining what clean
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
energy is for the state that we um put
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
in a category defining what clean energy
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
is so that everything that fits that
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
description is then included like I said
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
it's open for discussion
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh just making an observation of the
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the representative
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
McGee made saying uh Define clean as
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
non- greenhouse gas
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
emitting um water vapor is the most
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous greenhouse gas
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
Beyond carbon by factor of 50 to 100 so
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh if one was uh using hydrogen as a
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
fuel and hydrogen has been proposed as a
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh source of of a a fuel to be generated
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
by power plants or windmills when when
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
their load is not being uh fully
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
utilized it's it's an ancillary uh
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
byproduct that could be made because it
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
could be used as a fuel D
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards that concept of
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
non-greenhouse gas emitting does would
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
not work I think you're much better off
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
identifying nuclear as a clear um clean
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
fuel source right up
 
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.150 align:start position:0%
fuel source right up
front

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
noted representative schneller has a
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman fos um so
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
all you're trying to do is simply add
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
this to the definition of clean energy
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
you're not trying to sort of broaden the
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
definition of how we recognize clean
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
energy it's very narrow very simple
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
You're simply adding nuclear as clean is
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
that correct that that was my original
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
would oops representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um you just stated
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the intent was to Define nuclear en
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
energy however in your testimony you
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
said that the intent was to invite
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy technology to New
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and let them know we're open
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
for business so what is the intent of
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
you well you're correct uh the my intent
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
was to put nuclear under clean energy
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
because that's where it belongs and as a
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
result of doing that for the state
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
investors will look at those rsas and
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
see that oh they admit they accept ccept
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
that nuclear energy is part of clean
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
energy and therefore they're not adverse
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
to it should we choose to do business in
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
the State uh with involving nuclear
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
energy so I would say that my intent was
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
to Define it put nuclear in there and as
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
a result it would open the door to for
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
people to see that we are open to having
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
some form of clean nuclear energy come
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee this is just on
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
forum again we are adding a definition
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
for clean energy under the statutory
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
construction list of you know laws
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
relating to how we govern the state so
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's a definitional framework and the
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
way this bill would ask the language to
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
be added the definition in statutory uh
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
construction for clean energy would be
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
the words clean energy shall include
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
smallscale nuclear and renew rable
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
energy um it's a definition of clean
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
energy so um we're really trying to say
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
what does the term
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
mean and if we're just naming
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
technologies that are included rather
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
than the definition of clean energy I I
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
think it's not at the right level for us
 
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
think it's not at the right level for us
to

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
be putting it in that list I don't I
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's an appropriate
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
definition because it doesn't doesn't
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
cover us for future Technologies um and
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
future things that are not spelled out
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
in the list I think we should be
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
defining what clean energy
 
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.149 align:start position:0%
defining what clean energy
is

00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
noted okay thank you see no further
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas for
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation and call
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
next on the New Hampshire Public
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
spidel good morning to the Pu I see
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
you're all here this morning uh yes good
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
offer some brief remarks in support of
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
this bill uh from the puc regardless of
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs of how the technical
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
language will be worked out and where
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
it'll end up um PC thinks it's a
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
laudable goal to support the concept of
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh all of the above energy approach in
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire including nuclear uh that
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
has been a principle of our state energy
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
policy since at least the time of
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch so we just wanted to
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
offer our general overall support for
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
this bill um and that would be all
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
unless there's follow-up
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions questions for Mr
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
spidel representing the
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
commission seeing none thank you
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thought of one
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
spidel for taking my question uh so when
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
you say all of the above does that
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
really mean all of the above like any
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
energy Source well I would offer this in
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
so far as our neighbors especially in
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
Southern New England uh are calling on a
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly expanding capacity obligation we
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
heard from the iso about 73 GW and so we
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
were roughing out the math that would be
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent to about 80 Seabrook nuclear
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
power plants uh New Hampshire is unique
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
in so far as we are advocating and have
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
advocated for as long as I've been
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
around again since the time of Governor
 
00:21:58.279 --> 00:21:59.029 align:start position:0%
around again since the time of Governor
Lyn

00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
Lyn
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
for uh the capability to expand our
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
energy generation to serve this expanded
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
load need so uh we're a lonely voice
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
right now in the regional grid and I
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
think it's important for New Hampshire
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
to remind everyone out there that uh if
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
you want to radically expand your energy
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
diet you need to expand your energy
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
generation capability as well and so
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear being in the mix small nuclear
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
is indicated by uh Vice chairman Thomas
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
direction seeing no additional questions
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
I want to thank
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
you on behalf of the Pu for being here
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
this this morning thank you sir and next
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from Simon Warwick who is
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
starcube which I believe is New
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
startup good morning and
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
welcome good good morning Mr chairman uh
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you very
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
much for allowing me the time to present
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
to you today on behalf of star cube um
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
where I'm head of growth starcube is a
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
new Portsmouth New Hampshire based um
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
Pioneer in the advanced nuclear industry
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
looking to design manufacture deploy and
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
operate Advanced nuclear um throughout
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire May stand at a critical
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
juncture in its energy policy having the
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
potential to become a net exporter of
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
electricity to the rest of New England
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
through strategic decision making the
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
foundation of this transformation May
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
lie in adopting Advanced nuclear energy
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
technologies that promise to bring
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
reliable and cost competitive
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
electricity generation to commercial
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
realization within the next decade with
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
informed policy decisions public and
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
private focus and investment
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
um in advanced nuclear technology New
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could transform its energy
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
sector into a leading provider of
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
reliable and costeffective
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
electricity these are not my words these
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
words are taken directly from the
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
commission to investigate the
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
implementation of Next Generation
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology in New
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I commend the participants
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
of that commission some of whom are
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
present today for their detailed
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
methodical and comprehensive examination
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
of this topic
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the federal level in the US nuclear
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
energy deployment framework document
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
published in November of last year it
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
states the US government explicitly
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
considers nuclear energy as a clean
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
energy source stating that nuclear power
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
delivers safe clean reliable and
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
affordable electricity to communities
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation and plays a critical
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
role in the nation's transition to a
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy economy and this
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
classification extended into several
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
important um laws firstly the bipartisan
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law of 2021 which
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
explicitly included nuclear power in its
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
definition of clean energy under

grid looking down at the state level as
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas mentioned Arizona
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%

Virginia Washington Wyoming and most
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
recently Massachusetts in 2024 have
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
modified their definition of clean
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
energy to include nuclear
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
fision as a New Hampshire resident of
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
over 25 years and a representative of a
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
pioneering New Hampshire business I'm
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
committed like all in this room to the
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
advancement of the New Hampshire economy
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
the development of a skilled Workforce
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
access advanced high-paying jobs and a
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
clean environment in which to raise our
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
families clean energy is key to this
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
vision and by adding this designation
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
into law we are Str strengthening the
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire advantage and continuing
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
to position the state as a leader in New
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
England's energy
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
landscape I'll take any questions
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
anybody might have thank you appreciate
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you being here and I would like to
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
invite you to uh come back later in the
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
session when we have some spare time to
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
tell us more about your
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
company and if there are any questions
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
for this gentleman right now I'd remind
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
the members that the questions should be
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
about this bill not about starcube
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan did you have
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
one yeah I suppose so I mean it is about
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
the bill uh in the sense that we are you
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
know trying to advaned uh nuclear energy
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
in our state and so I I I welcome uh the
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
gentleman coming in today and taking our
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
question this is just a question to
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
allay the fears of people who agree that
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
we need nuclear energy and in all of the
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
above strategy as I do but uh do have
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about the waste product that so
 
00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
what is your pitch to people who are
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about the waste products uh
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know caused by nuclear energy
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely I understand um unlike carbon
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
emissions from fossil fuels which are
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
released into the atmosphere and cannot
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
be easily retrieved nuclear waste is
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
stored its volume is minuscule compared
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the waste and pollution generated by
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels that release toxins like
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
Mercury sulfur dioxide and particulate
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
Mass directly into the air and water
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
harm nuclear spent fuels is are securely
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
managed in regulated facilities ensuring
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
minimal risk to the environment and
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
human health advances in technology such
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
as fast reactors and reprocessing can
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the volume and
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
toxicity of nuclear waste geological
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
repositories like finland's onalo
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
facility demonstrate that safe long-term
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
storage for for nuclear waste is
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
feasible the waste is isolated deep
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
underground far from ecosystems and
 
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.630 align:start position:0%
underground far from ecosystems and
human

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
population representative Harrington has
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
a question more of a comment than
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
anything else I think when we're talking
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
about the waste people ought to
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
understand putting it in say minimals
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
kind of like what does that mean well if
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
you took one of these tables right here
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
that could contain 18 months worth of
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
spend fuel from seab Brook so the whole
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
40 years or even if it goes to 880 years
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
you could fit all the waste in this room
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's not that big of a problem people
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
overestimate that quite a bit thank you
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
I would I would add to that that um star
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
cube reactors being five 5 to 15
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
megawatts um our orders of magnitude
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
sebr representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I'm I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
get your name I just have that you're
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
the head of growth yeah Simon Warick
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
Simon all right thank you very much um
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
you right now you're the only nucle
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
nuclear private facility in New
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're not a facility okay um
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
we are a business that is designing and
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
looking to manufacture Advanced uh
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
micronuclear rectors here in New
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you can I
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
continue thank you
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
um with the intent of this bill being to
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
essentially open doors for New Hampshire
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
to nuclear energy do you anticipate any
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
kind of oversaturation of this industry
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh no I do not um uh as
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
has been said before especially I think
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
by representative Thomas
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
um as I'm going around the country and
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
indeed um other countries looking at
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
where star cube can make a difference
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
one of the first things that comes up is
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
sighting um not so much the technology
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
lots have been written about Advanced
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
nuclear and and it's different to
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
differences to traditional nucle clear
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um there is a
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
huge need for increased power we all
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that but on the industrial
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
side not so much on the sort of microG
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
side not so much on the power generation
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
side I'm constantly receiving calls from
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
businesses who would like to use
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear to power things like
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin mining data centers
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
um uh using uh um process heat in their
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
manufacturing capabilities they don't
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
care where they site from a state point
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
of view they're looking for an
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
environment that welcomes them um where
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
they can do business defining uh nuclear
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
as clean energy helps in those
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
decision-making processes by those uh
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
entities our order book contains
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
companies in all categories uh from
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
power generation through microgrids
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
through process power that would be
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
willing to relocate or construct their
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire should the
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and um popular uh opinions
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
provide for that they're ready now and
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're also working with the University
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
Systems not only here in New Hampshire
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
but in our neighboring states to develop
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
the curricula that enables such a
 
00:31:54.639 --> 00:31:56.029 align:start position:0%
the curricula that enables such a
skilled

00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
skilled
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce this uh definition will help
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
state representative parall has a
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair Vos and thank
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
you for coming here today um you
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned Next Generation nuclear lays
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
on a timetable for roll out within the
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
next decade and I'll admit that seems
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
ambitious to me but are you aware of any
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
current uh uh projects that have begun
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
or what is typical timeline to meet that
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
10-year roll out yeah I mean there are
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.750 align:start position:0%
10-year roll out yeah I mean there are
sever

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
sever
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh companies that are uh doing similar
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
to what we're doing um that um if if I'm
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
honest a little bit ahead of us there is
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
only one company that is on the docket
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
at the NRC um for licensing their new re
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
reactor design we believe that starcube
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
could have an operating reactor within
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
about five
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
years thank
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
want to thank you very much for being
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
here and I hope you'll accept our
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
invitation to come back future
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
date and since I have no more pink cards
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
189 and open a public hearing on a house
 
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.269 align:start position:0%
189 and open a public hearing on a house
bill

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
221 relative to assessment of cost
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the S system benefits
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
charge and I'm going to ask the Bill's
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor representative Harrington
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
to present this legislation to
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
us we have a lot of pink cards on this
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
one so it's going to take a while I
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
might have to limit um testimony to
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
three minutes there's another
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
one one more and I just received several
 
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.830 align:start position:0%
one one more and I just received several
more

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
so so representative Harrington where
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
and when you finish your testimony I
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
please good morning I'm uh Mike
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
Harrington represent straford uh
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
district 18 and this bill is a it's
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
about a timing issue and uh how we do
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
the uh cost Effectiveness review for the
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
um um Energy Efficiency programs and
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
over since I submitted this I've been
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
talking to some people and I realized
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
that there may be an issue with the
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
timing of this so rather than have me
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
pontificate up here I'd rather have
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
someone who actually knows the ins and
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
outs of it speak on it so I would defer
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
to the Public Utilities Commission to
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay um you have nothing else to say
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill I guess you're not going to accept
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
questions either all right so next I've
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
got a pin card here that wants to bring
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
forward Alex spidel chairman Dam goldner
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
chairman chatapati
 
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:20.710 align:start position:0%
chairman chatapati
and

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner Del arano or commissioner
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
chat upai and commissioner Del arano so
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you all want to come
 
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.190 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you all want to come
together

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
or just want to let Mr spidel speak for
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
you or what but um yes uh Mr chairman
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
we'll just come up in sequence so I'll
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
just give a brief opening remark and
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
then if it would be all right I'd seed
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the floor to Chairman
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
goldner certainly so um as by way of
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
opening uh the commission wanted to
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank uh the drafters of this bill just
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
as last year I had testified in favor of
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
a similar effort both here and at the
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
Senate um because of the importance that
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
the commission attaches to its uh
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
analytical rigor and Independence in
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
assessing Energy Efficiency programming
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we are very appreciative of this
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
effort it's a good step in the right
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
direction the two angles that are going
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be discussed today there's first the
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
tight time frame issue that may need to
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
be reworked as indicated by uh
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and then the
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
second element that we'll put in a plug
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
for is for reworking or striking through
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
a deleting uh Roman 6 A5 which is the
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
following um provision of 374
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
DF colon 3 that would need to have some
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
attention in order to affect the intent
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the intent of this
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill to reactivate the commission's uh
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
analytical capabilities in this area so
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh without further Ado I would like to
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
see the floor uh and the microphone to
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh chairman goldner thank
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
gold good morning chairman Bose uh
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee I'll just say set some brief
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
brief comments and being sensitive to
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
the time limit uh the commission as
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
attorney spidel U mentioned is here
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
today to support this bill which allows
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
the commission to improve trial plan
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
programs and is an important step in the
 
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
programs and is an important step in the
right

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
Direction I'll just touch on the 12-
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
month stipulation in the bill that um
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that means the commission would need to
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
complete its work its adjudication uh in
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
the current year um because the next
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
trial plan starts on January 1st 2027
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
there's the 12- month stipulation so
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
what that means is this uh this
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
committee the house ultimately the
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
governor's signature would have to be
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
complete um very quickly to give us
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
enough time to have an adjudication so
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
we would just encourage uh quick passage
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill and uh potentially a
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in the 12-month window so that
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that we have U time to give the
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
parties process in in dealing with this
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
issue uh secondly uh as mentioned by
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
attorney spidel this Bell address
 
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
attorney spidel this Bell address
addresses

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
D4 but in D5 the legislation the
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislature only allowed uh the
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
commission to look at program
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
changes uh which means that only
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
3% of the current tral plan was reviewed
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
by the commission 97% was not reviewed
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
or regulated because D5 doesn't permit
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
the commission to uh to evaluate the
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
current plan it only allows the
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
commission to look at changes to the
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
plan so uh the commission would like to
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to review that
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
sometime now or in the future so that uh
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that somebody's looking at the entire
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
plan and not just a fraction of it and
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
then finally in the spirit of time I'll
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
seed the floor to commissioner chetto
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
Bai of course taking any questions you
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
might have for me um who has some
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
additional observations on the benefit
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
to cost tests that are in this U statute
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and he can elaborate a little
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
more on some of the challenges with the
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
current current tests so I can take any
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions or seed the floor to to
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner CH any questions for the
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
chairman representative McGee thank you
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr goldner for
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
being here um I was here when 549 was
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
put out um in order to basically assist
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
small businesses in New Hampshire that
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
were participating in the New Hampshire
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
saves program in terms of weatherization
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
and other Energy Efficiency Partnerships
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
that they had done with the utilities so
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
my question is you're talking about
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
being able to to get at 90% 97% that is
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently not regulated in the plans
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
that are coming to you um after having
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
been developed by the utilities in
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with um the statutory desires
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the legislature in terms of what we
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
would like our Energy Efficiency
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
programs to do and so the question is um
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
can you foresee
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps um
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
sanctioning off a majority of the
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
program is the piece that creates
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
stability for all of the parties that
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
are involved in terms of they're being
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
able to count on and plan for and
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
deliver Services into a three-year plan
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
it just provides stability right so I
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
guess my question is what is it that you
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
think having jurisdiction over the 97%
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
that remains stable uh would be of
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
benefit um thank you for the question I
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
would say that the threeyear time a in
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the tral plan gives that kind of
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
stability of course the
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature um allows the utilities to
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
come in every year for any changes that
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
they want so it's kind of set set up I
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
would say in a in a stable way but I
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
would say to the point of your question
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
that a periodic review of the programs
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
is uh is wise things change um
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
technology changes and uh and so having
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
a process by which there's refresh every
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
3 years as opposed to 97% getting stale
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
that could go on for even decades
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
without review um I would suggest at a
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
periodic review and every three years
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
seems like frequently enough uh to look
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
at uh the programs would would make
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
sense follow up so um so that would put
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission in a
 
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
position of really being a party to the
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
development of that plan then rather
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
than having as it's been since we've had
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire saves the
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
expertise has been requested from the
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
utilities um in order to execute the
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
programs and also bring evidence to the
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission for
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
adjudication in terms of the fact that
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
they're meeting the standards um that
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
are outlined in the statute so I'm just
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if that doesn't
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
change the role of the Public Utilities
 
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
change the role of the Public Utilities
Commission

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.330 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.589 align:start position:0%
Commission
[Music]

00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
to be um participating more in the
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
pieces that we delegated to the
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
utilities it's just feels that way to me
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
if I could just briefly address the
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
question yes please um so I would say
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
first that the legislature wisely uh set
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
the budget for uh Energy Efficiency back
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
in 2021 in the old days prior to that
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
the commission set the budget but um I
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was completely appropriate
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
and sensible for the legislature to set
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
that budget and so that's the
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
environment we're now in so now
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
underneath that budget the question is
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to spend that money
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
for customers whether it's large
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
customers small customers uh residential
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
customers what's the best way to spend
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
the money and that gets to the very
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
point of this bill which is the benefit
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
the cost analysis that is uh sort of at
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh one big chunk of the analysis that
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in order to determine
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
which programs are are better than
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
others and the fact of it is in my
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that some programs and some
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
projects and some measures are better
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
than others and we want to make sure
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
that we're prioritizing the right
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
projects representative uh Wendy
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
specifically referencing lines 10 and 11
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
in the bill where it says the commission
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
may consider modifications to the
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
granite state test and different or
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
additional tests developed through an
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
judicative process can you give me an
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
example or idea of some modifications um
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
of the granite state test that may be
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
considered or what the different or
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
additional tests might be thank you sure
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
if it would be all right commissioner
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
chatai has uh very brief comments on
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
both the granted state test the trct
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
test and other uh potential tests and uh
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a PhD in economics and is very well
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that question at the
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
level of detail that I I think you would
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
want if that would be okay we can defer
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
that question to commissioner
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
chatay yes let's do that representative
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question yeah thank you
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
point point of order excuse me hello
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
hang on point of order representative
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
Harrington um has
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
testified oh good point good point i'
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
had forgotten that so forget
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
question if he even asked one I'm not
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
sure I didn't get it written down so it
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
never happen his testimony was so brief
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
just it's like passing through a little
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
town if you blink your eyes you could
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
put those words in writing so I can
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
bring them back to my wife because
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise she's not going to believe
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
it okay all right um representative Vice
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
chair um a a uh um curiosity question
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
97% um could you define how much that is
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
in in real terms in in dollars it's
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
approximately the numbers are a little
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
off I didn't prepare that number for for
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing today but it's between $220
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
million yeah over a three-year time
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
Horizon yeah that's right okay uh let's
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
bring up uh commissioner chattai for his
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner and
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning and thank you for
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so let
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
me first make a statement and then I can
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to wear the The
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
Economist hat here to
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts when we think
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
about benefit to cost ratios and we are
 
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.589 align:start position:0%
about benefit to cost ratios and we are
talking

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
society then it becomes important in my
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
opinion to capture all benefits as
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
reasonably as possible as well as all
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
costs that are driving the changes so
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's in that context when I'm
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about the granite state
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
test um as opposed to let's say the TRC
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
test um the granite state test is it's
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
based on something called a utility test
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay and it it only looks at cost that
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
appear in the bills and then Compares
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
those with the benefits that arise out
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
of any program um in in
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
reality when
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
the program participants even though
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
they spend their own money they're also
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
getting a big chunk from other rate
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
pairs that you have to understand that
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
resource is compete we live in a world
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
where resources are scarce so when
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about societal impact you
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
need to to capture also the costs that
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
the program participants spend on their
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
own to get a better picture of what the
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
societal benefits are relative to the
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
societal costs so because the granite
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
state test does not do that it only it
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes out a big chunk of the cost uh
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
that is associated with um the
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
participants costs from their own
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
Pockets it it sort of skews the
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
the look at the societal test meaning
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know I'm looking at the benefits to
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
cost overall for the entire Society so
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
that is something I I I get concerned
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
about um there there are problems also
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
with the TRC test that it doesn't really
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
capture all of the benefits because sort
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
of decided okay it's harder to get a
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
sense of how to quantify the benefits I
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
think there is a need to put a lot of
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
stress on
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
analytically calculating what the
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
benefits are
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and that that is you know it's even
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
if we do it reasonably that's good but
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
at this point we may have not looked at
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
it as holistically as we should so um
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
those are just the comments on on the
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
tests that are being talked about I also
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
think in in the statute when you have
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
granite state test or even TRC it's not
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere else in the statute to
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge and that sort
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
of creates issues so
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
um the ability to look at the granite
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
state test and
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
this um Bill sort of does that that is a
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
significant Improvement but I also
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
commented on the overall picture so
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
there are there are ways to further
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
improve things going forward that's I'm
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you so I think I under
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
heard you understood you to say that the
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
granite state test doesn't capture all
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
the costs and the Total
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test doesn't capture all
 
00:50:22.799 --> 00:50:23.589 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test doesn't capture all
the

00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
benefits so the statute currently
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
provides for using both together that do
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
they capture all the costs and benefits
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
not really even with the granite state
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
test it
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
could calculate the benefits better and
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
there are some benefits that are not
 
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.349 align:start position:0%
there are some benefits that are not
being

00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
captured even in the granite state test
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
um and that is true for the TRC as
 
00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
um and that is true for the TRC as
well

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
the sequencing matters so if you're
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to say GST is the primary test and
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
TRC is the secondary test it's not like
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're even if you're maybe
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
capturing all of
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits and the cost but you are
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
using them um differently for the
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
different test then you don't really
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
have a perfect sense of what what is the
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
society so the statute also my follow-up
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
question would be the statute also
 
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
question would be the statute also
provides

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
well actually the the bill not the
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
statute but the modifications to the
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
statute that the bill proposes would
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
allow the commission to consider
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
modifications to the granite state test
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
and different or additional tests is
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
there anything you could say about
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
either of those U Provisions in the in
 
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.069 align:start position:0%
either of those U Provisions in the in
the

00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill I that's why I said that is the a
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
but I'm also speaking
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
to as the term granite state test is
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
being used currently and TRC is being
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
used currently so I'm just
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
indicating this is this is welcome what
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
you have and I'm trying to justify how
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
this will help in getting to a better
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
place okay understood thank you
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question this
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
is very interesting to me um it sounds
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
like we don't have really a good test in
 
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.750 align:start position:0%
like we don't have really a good test in
your

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
view do you think that we actually need
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
to construct a whole new test and if
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
worded it is it it will become part
 
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.270 align:start position:0%
worded it is it it will become part
of

00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
um you know let's say a p docket where
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
the different parties will provide input
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
and that's one way to begin the process
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then I what I have indicated I mean
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
obviously um I'll have to be working
 
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
within the within the the the bounds and
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
stay in the lane as far as what is part
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
of the record what is not but I'm simp
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
just indicating that within that process
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
there is there are ways to improve the
 
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
there is there are ways to improve the
test

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
that representative McGee has a question
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair okay I have a few um
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman and I uh were each members
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
of the easy board which was disbanded in
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
the last bium and it was my
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that um that that was
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
where the trienal budgets were
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
coordinated discussed and then brought
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
to the Public Utilities Commission for
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
adjudication so it was just was
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
testified to earlier that that the the
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
Pu was was creating those budgets and I
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that was how it was
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
working before but but my question is in
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said that the all of
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
the costs are not captured because
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
you're not including the money that the
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
homeowner puts in when an Energy
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um project
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
happens and I I would argue that that
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
cost does not rightfully belong in the
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
overall cost which increases the cost
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio or lowers the cost benefit
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
ratio because the program was designed
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
to be our contribution and the um you
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
know our efforts at increasing Energy
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
Efficiency in order to lower demand
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
basically right it was a demand side
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
effort on the state of New Hamp so the
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
program isn't designed to um to account
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
for the fact that the homeowner wants to
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
undertake this they also are going to um
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
they are going to benefit from uh the
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
savings long term right but the if you
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
are looking only at the cost of the
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
program that we are providing through
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
the state and the benefits that are
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
happening in terms of the energy mix and
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
the savings then I think it is is
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate that it be measured the way
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
it is and if there were going to be a
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
change to that ratio then the decision
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
should have more uh stakeholder input
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
than just the public is there a question
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
here representative yeah no um well I
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
mean he's talking to us about what he
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
thinks is right and wrong with the way
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
it works right now so I had to
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
articulate what I thought um from the
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
context that I have around this process
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
as it's been um undertaken over the
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
years so my question
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
is can you understand what I'm saying
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
about the fact that I would think the
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
reason that the cost that the homeowner
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
puts in as part of the granite state
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
test was purposely left out and maybe
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
the utilities can also comment on that
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
because it it doesn't create the correct
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
cost benefit for a program it's it's not
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
all the things of society it's a program
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
and the people who are participating in
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
the program that you're trying to
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
respectfully first of all I wasn't part
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.549 align:start position:0%
of the process
so

00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
secondly the whole point
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that you're trying to get to a point
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
where you you are targeting the societal
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and the societal costs properly
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the way that is being done under GST
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's completely Miss missing the point
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
and when it does it I could even say
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's rather convenient that you are sort
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
of ignoring all of the cost that the
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
those program participants paid but they
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
also got a lot of money from somewhere
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
else so obviously somebody is going to
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
be more interested in doing stuff
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
because they're not paying everything
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
from their own pocket and ultimately if
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
you are thinking about all New
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um citizens
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
then it's important that the test is
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
true to the fact that you're measuring
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
the total societal benefits and the
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
total costs that's of the basic tenant
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
of any economic efficiency analysis and
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
so I I mean um does that mean that if
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's if the statute says something that
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do that no I'm not I'm just
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
giving you my opinions as an economist
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
here thank you okay thank you so let's
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh move on to uh commissioner Del arano
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
we have six more pink cards here of
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
people who would like to testify
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
so oh Mr de Delano has nothing to add so
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
Pu no oh yes there are okay so
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson and please phrase
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
it as a question this is not a debate
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to hear an elaborate
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
background just to ask a question please
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh the question is
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
you talked about the test is there in
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's discussed academically does
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
there exist a formula
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
currently uh that establishes how the
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
test is performed available thank you Mr
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
chair I I don't have
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
the exact references here but the that
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few tests in the
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
literature so for for example um the
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
granite state test it's sort of based on
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
the utility test um you know concept so
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
um it's based on what's in the utility
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
bills and there are other approaches too
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
and um the TRC test is more like I'm
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
going to go with the total benefits
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
total costs um and in that construct
 
00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.069 align:start position:0%
total costs um and in that construct
again

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
um different jurisdiction have chosen
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
different approaches different tweaks of
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
it but there are there are academic
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
there are specific measures that are um
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
literature okay thank you all right
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you to the Pu for being here this
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
morning and for giving us your
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation I now
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from the Department
 
00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
of energy and call on Megan Stone to
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
give us the Department's take on this
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill the department is neutal neutral on
 
00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.230 align:start position:0%
bill the department is neutal neutral on
the

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill but likely has something to say
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you good morning Mr chair
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
record my name is Megan Stone
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison with the Department
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
of energy um so as the chair said the
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
Department's position on this bill is
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
neutral um I'm just here today to give
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of background and um
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
some context from where we are so as
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard it's related to our states
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
rate payer funded Energy Efficiency
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
programs uh rate rate payer Energy
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs are required to be
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
coste effective meaning they have a uh
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
every dollar of spending leads to at
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
least $1 of benefit an important
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
component of cost- Effectiveness
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is having a cost benefit
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
test that lets us evaluate whether
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
programs are in fact costeffective a
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
cost benefit test lets us know whether
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
we should or should not particular
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
programs and allows us to prioritize
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
those programs to maximize value for
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
rate pairs the current cost benefit test
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh which was developed by stakeholders
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
when the state was considering adopting
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
an Energy Efficiency resource standard
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh the grant state test was approved by
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
pu but was not yet a statutory
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
requirement um for a bit of background
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
in 2021 uh there was a decision on the
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
2123 Energy Efficiency plan that was uh
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
seen seen as unpopular among
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders legisl and the then
 
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
Governor um this decision led to House
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 which was intended to stabilize
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
the programs and put in place guard
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
rails that limited the issues that the
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
Pu could consider one of those guard
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
rails was the granite state test was put
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
into LW and it passed both bodies
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
unanimously in 2024 the
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
2426 3year Energy Efficiency plan was
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
approved and in that order the puc made
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
a clear their interpretation of the law
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
was that they could not change anything
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the granite state test and
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
that interpretation means that any
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
changes to the cost benefit tests
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
remains in the hands of the
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislature House Bill uh 221 would give
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
the authority to change the cost benefit
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
test back to the PC and the bill would
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
lock in the grant of state test for the
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
remainder of the 2426 Energy Efficiency
 
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
plan then for 2729 period it would
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
authorize the puc to undertake
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings to modify the
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
current cost benefit test or use
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
different tests um so in summary the
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
bill before you uh it gives the today
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
gives legislature the responsibility to
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want to be involved
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the details or delegate it uh back to
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
the Pu and that's where we are we're
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
neutral like I
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
said questions for Miss Stone
 
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.029 align:start position:0%
said questions for Miss Stone
representative

01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
capan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
Mr stone for coming in um I appreciate
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
that as a society we need to look
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
holistically at the cost effectiveness
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
of any program that the state is is uh
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
is sponsoring
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
um but just out of my own curiosity I
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could tell me do
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the grant State the
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
grant state test includes a look at the
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
benefits do those benefits include at
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh um the mitigation of climate change
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
that would occur as as a result of
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
increased Energy
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh so I I would have to take
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
I would just have to double check on
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
that I knew the department so I just
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
want to get my facts straight I'll get
 
01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:28.430 align:start position:0%
want to get my facts straight I'll get
back

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we want
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
to thank you thank you before I call the
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
next person I just want to let everyone
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
here in the room know that house bill
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
224 FN scheduled at 10 10 a.m. will
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
actually begin as soon as we complete
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on this bill House
 
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.269 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on this bill House
Bill

01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
221 next up let's get the utility
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
perspective and call on Michael Lata
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
from eversource and Mark leminger uh as
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
well to get their take on this
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
gentlemen good morning uh Michael AATA
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy uh with
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
me today is Mark L menager who is our
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
supervisor of our Energy Efficiency
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
programs here in New Hampshire I
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to test tesi
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
for you this morning uh we are coming to
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
register our opposition for HB
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
221 uh we do appreciate the bill
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors intent to try to provide
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
additional regulatory flexibility
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
however we do believe that the
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
legislature was correct uh in 2022 when
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
it passed HB
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
549 uh which put the grant at state test
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
into statute at that time the
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
legislature heard considerable am kind
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
of testimony from a wide range of
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders who all spoke to
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
the need for a certain level of
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
certainty stability and understanding of
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
the program guard rails going
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
forward stability and certainty in the
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
development and execution of these
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
programs uh is really quite critical
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's critical for the utilities who
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
administer the programs it's critical
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the contractors who actually go out
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
and perform the work to weatherize homes
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
and improve the efficiency of a business
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
and most importantly it's critical to
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
the customers who rely on the programs
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
we believe that reversing HB 549 and
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
allowing the Pu to use a different test
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is developed through an undefined
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process raises a number of
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
concerns uh the timing issue has already
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
been discussed but we're happy to go
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
into uh additional detail on that but it
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
is important to note that the current
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
granite state test was developed veled
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
through an
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
extensive uh stakeholder process that I
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
believe took over two years before uh
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
approval by the Public Utilities
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
Commission we believe that the current
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
framework provides for a rigorous cost
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
benefit test whose inputs are regularly
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
updated and the result of this test is
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
our positive outcomes for our customers
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
who ultimately rely on these programs to
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
lower their energy costs and with that
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you let's uh start the
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
questioning with representative migi
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Lata for
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
being here Mr leminger it's good to see
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
you again um my question goes back to
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
one that I already put out there which
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
is the idea of including sort of the all
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
social benef cost and all social benefit
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
I my understanding is that this
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
individual program is not designed to to
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
take that kind of a global look it's
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
basically looking at what was spent and
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
the benefits that we derive from the
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
work that we actually did contrasting
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
those two things so can you speak to
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
that Mr linger sure the benefit cost
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
test working group was commenced from
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
2018 through 2019 the recommendations
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
provided in 2019 one of the aspects that
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
was looked at was the TRC the Total
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test which is what we used
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the granite state test as our
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
primary test it included participant
 
01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
costs but excluded participant benefits
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
so as part of that review of the working
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
group we looked at should we include
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
both the costs and the benefits and the
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
result that was determined of the
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
working group was for symmetrical
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
purposes we will exclude the participant
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
costs because we're excluding the
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
participant benefits so you're able to
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
have if you are including one you should
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
be including the other the result of the
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
working group was we we will exclude
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
both because it's hard to measure or
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure sorry the
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
participant benefits and reach agreement
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
on what those values should
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
be followup so the follow-up would be
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
then do you think
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
um where we're at now
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
has reinstituted the stability that
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking for it sounds like from
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr Lata you're saying
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
that that you think that we stabilize
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
the program and that we should be
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
looking to rework something that's
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
already been worked significantly right
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh so is that is that the position we
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the current cost test the
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
granite state test provides us with
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
certainty and stability not only for the
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
utilities in terms of planning the
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
programs but also in terms of providing
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
customers and contractors certainty in
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
terms of what types of projects and
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
programs are going to be provided going
 
01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:56.349 align:start position:0%
programs are going to be provided going
forward

01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner chattai testified that he
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
in his judgment the granite state test
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
does not capture all costs and the Total
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test does not capture all
 
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.430 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test does not capture all
the

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefits and I asked him at the time if
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
he thought that the two tests together
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
captured all costs and benefits and he
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
said he did not think so what is your
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
memory of the proceeding that adopted
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
the granite state or developed the
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
granite state
test

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
and what weaknesses may it may it have
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that allow it to not capture all
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
costs so the Total Resource cost test
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
the test that was used prior to the
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
granite state test it includes
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
participant costs but excludes
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
participant benefits the granite state
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
test as part of the working group that
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
developed it we did not develop
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
participant benefits and values that we
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
could agree to and Associate to those
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
benefits therefore the participant costs
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
and benefits are excluded from that test
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
in order to preserve symmetry across the
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
test if you're including the cost for
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
participants you should be including the
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
benefits but since we were excluding
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
participant benefits the decision was
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
costs okay okay thank you you think
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's the right thing to
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
do symmetry should be included yes okay
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
thanks further
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chair Thomas has a
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I remember a
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Pu that basically
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
stated that the way it currently reads
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
now that the results are skewed and so
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
if the results are skewed how does that
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
affect your program in terms of who gets
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
the job done or in terms of how you
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
accurately read who um who can um
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from the the
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
program how are the results
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
skewed well um again that question
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's okay I think it's fair to say
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
that we disagree with that assessment by
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
the commission we do not believe that
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
results okay seeing no further question
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to call next on
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%

programs more importantly we work with
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%

cost of living it feels like just
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday we were here celebrating the
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
signing of House Bill
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
549 which passed with an overwhelming
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
353 to zero vote and solidified the
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
granted state test a system tailored
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to New Hampshire's unique
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
needs and Today's Energy market cost s
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
the most critical Factor whether it's
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
the systems benefit charge or the price
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
of energy related measures these
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
programs are laser focused at being cost
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
effective in ensuring the state's
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs are responsible
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
stewards of public resources I'd like to
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
share a story that illustrates the
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
importance of these programs just last
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
Tuesday while preparing A continuing
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
education session for the state's energy
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
Auditors a colleague told me about it
 
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.149 align:start position:0%
Auditors a colleague told me about it
interesting

01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
encounter he had recently worked with a
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
client who was a staunch opponent of New
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Energy Efficiency programs a
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
member of this very House of
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives in fact despite his opes
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
uh opposition the representative
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
admitted he was participating in the
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs because as he
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
put it I pay into it so I'm going to get
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
something out of it this is the exact
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
kind of customer that these programs are
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
design for for someone who would not
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
pursue weatherization without an
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
incentive that these programs provide
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
even those who oppose Energy Efficiency
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives recognize a fundamental
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
value of being comfortable in their
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
homes and being able to affordably heat
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
them that's how you know you have a good
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
program when even the stronger strongest
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
critics benefit from it and acknowledge
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
its necess uh necessity New Hampshire
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
has built a robust Energy Efficiency
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
program that has long protected the
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
interest of taxpayers rate payers and
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
all residents this was underscored by
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
the unanimous
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
353 zero vote in House Bill 549 a vote
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
that placed Energy Efficiency at the
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
Forefront of New Hampshire's priorities
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
that vote represented progress
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration and a commitment to the
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
state's Energy Efficiency plan I stand
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
here today in strong opposition to House
 
01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.390 align:start position:0%
here today in strong opposition to House
Bill

01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
221 a poorly disguised attempt to
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
dismantle a program that benefits every
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire all
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
contractors in the New Hampshire saves
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
program operate Within These qualified
 
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
programs as there are no contractors
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
dedicated dedicated exclusively to
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
income based services to support the
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
state's initiative cont rors like myself
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
must work across all the program types
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
any reduction or elimination of the New
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State's funding will have a
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
direct and significant impact on income
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals in New Hampshire
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
resulting in fewer to no Services being
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
provided to them under the
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs I just
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and your thoughtful
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%

01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh a fairly good understanding of the
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
granite state test as someone who
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
actively works in the field have you
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
seen any deficiencies from the test that
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
apply directly to your

itl we are opposed to the the passage of
 
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.189 align:start position:0%
itl we are opposed to the the passage of
HB

01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
221 the very same pu that this
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
legislature had to very publicly correct
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
when they made an attempt to claw back
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
$76 million from the poorest of our
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
neighbors is being set up to dictate
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
programs once again from their unelected
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
Purge do the members of this committee
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
remember that the Pu did an executive
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
order issued on the last hour of the
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
last day of the former chair's reign
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
it was going to devastate hundreds of
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
small businesses but you fought
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
back this legislature said very loudly
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
and unanimously that weatherization and
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
every effort to reduce heating cost
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
matters in the granite state the New
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature has the final word
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
however the legislation as drafted sets
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
up an adjudicative process and has the
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
authority to approve Pro changes prior
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the next
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
cycle who was involved in the
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process what happened to
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
outlining which stakeholders shall be

you for your time today and have a nice
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
day questions for Mr
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
Mayberry representative
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Mayberry for coming in um just a
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
quick background I am somebody who's who
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
took advantage of the New Hampshire
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
saves last year and um reinsulated some
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
of my house and I can tell you that the
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Comfort level this winter is is is
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
without measure so I I just wondered
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that uh in terms
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
of costs and benefits I find it hard to
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
be able to quantify the benefit of
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
somebody living in a you know a warm and
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
secure house and and how would you
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
quantify that in your opinion you don't
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to answer that members have been
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
warned that would you agree with me
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions are not appropriate for this
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to thank you for
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%

turkot who is here to represent turn
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:05.639 align:start position:0%
my testimony today my name is Michael
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
turkot and I'm here in strong opposition
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
of HB 221 this bill inacted would pose a
 
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
significant harm to the Energy
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and energy reduction
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
initiatives that are instrumental in
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
driving New Hampshire's process across
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
the state these programs not only reduce
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
energy consumption and cost for
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
residents businesses
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
but they also play a critical role in
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
Foster economic growth and environmental
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
stability in this
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
community one of my primary concerns is
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
the devastation the impact of this
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
legislation would have on my
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
employment the Energy Efficiency sector
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
is thriving in New Hampshire providing
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of well-paying job across
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
diverse Fields the instability of HB 221
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
would provide me as a business owner
 
01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:53.629 align:start position:0%
would provide me as a business owner
projecting

01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
instability leaving hardworking families
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
without income and significantly
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
weakening our local
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
economy in addition to this direct
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
impact on my employment and our business
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's the Energy Efficiency initiatives
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
would create a financial step
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
back to our local constituents these
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
programs offer uh enable companies to
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
lower operational costs in incur
 
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
increase competitive nature expand their
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
operations and removing cultural the uh
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
curtailing um these efforts would
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
disrupt the positive impact and H hinder
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
state my name is Michael turkot and I'm
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
strongly in opposition of HB 221 happy
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
to take any questions chairman thank you
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mr turkot you asserted in the at the
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony that this
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
legislation would
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
desate or destroy the Energy Efficiency
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
programs in our state
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
how does the specifically does the
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
language of this bill do that so since
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh I can speak to um to our business
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
since HB 549 was um cleaned or or passed
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
I should say sir and so that allowed us
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
um when there was inst instability in
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
the market to feel very confident to
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
reinvest into our specific business um I
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
know counterparts of mine uh who will
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
speak today and already have uh the home
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
Performance Contractors we feel as
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
though that now we can invest into our
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
companies with stability with this
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
three-year plan what this bill does is
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
it allows in my interpretation the Pu or
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
someone else to make radical changes I I
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
say on a whim in my personal opinion
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
where right now I have a stable
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
structure to to actually grow and Foster
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
our business I'll take that a step
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
further sir we we grew our business
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
through the last two years from 15
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
employees to 30 knowing that the
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
consideration of that bill provided us a
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we could grow in this New
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy uh we we as uh
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
employees now or we have employees now
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
which is 30 employees I'm sorry I'm a
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
little flustered 30 employees total um
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
and we we support a lot of families that
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
way as well just do that
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
work okay seeing no further questions
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
we'll move next
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
to and I hope I'm going to get this
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
right that the handwriting is little
 
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.830 align:start position:0%
right that the handwriting is little
ambiguous

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
ambiguous
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%

01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
himself good morning honorable chairman
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
Bose and members of the committee my
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
name is Chase penoyer and I'm here to
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
represent myself uh and I oppose HB 221
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a business owner I I uh just
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
recently purchased a company called
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
resilient Billings group based here in
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
conquer and we have 16 employees were
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated to finding costeffective
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency improvements
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I oppose this bill
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
because it essentially eliminates the
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
guard rails that have been uh created uh
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
with HB 549 and I'll never forget that
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
Friday evening when the uh leaving uh
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
chair person of the Pu put an order that
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
completely scrapped the Energy
 
01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:31.719 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs I haven't been in
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
this room since HB 549 hearings and it
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
was an incredibly tumultuous time uh in
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
my career but also in in the
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
business I oppose this legislation HB
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
221 for really three main reasons the
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
first is that I see every day customers
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
benefiting from New Hampshire saves I
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
see customer custers that are are uh
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
engaged and and getting projects that
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
are uh resulting in in uh economic
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
returns for years to come this is this
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
is daily if our customers didn't like
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
the programs or didn't have good
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
experiences we wouldn't be in business
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's just as simple as that the other
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
reason that I oppose hb22 is because I
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
um believe in in jobs I'm I have 16
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
employees I'm one of the contractors
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
here that I think just in this room we
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
represent over a 100 full-time employees
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's significant and in Energy
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
Efficiency as an industry there are
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
thousands it's not just me Consultants
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
or insulators or
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
HVAC um technicians it's electricians
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's Builders it's so many people in the
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
state and I think it's so very important
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
to provide stability in in this Arena
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
the the third reason why I oppose this
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is because of and we've all
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
sort of touched on it we as as business
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
owners can't operate in an unstable
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
environment without stability in the
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
marketplace I don't know what I'm going
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
to do and if cost Effectiveness is
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
questioned in New Hampshire saves that
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
means that most of our projects probably
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
won't pass a new cost Effectiveness
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
standard that has unknown variables I'm
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not an economist but every single
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
one of our projects goes through a
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
rigorous calculation every single one of
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
our projects that receives utility
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
funding is vetted so it's not like we're
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
out here just getting
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh or or elaborate or uh overly
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
expensive projects through the gate I
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
mean this is this is real work that's
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's vetted um and with that uh I can
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
take questions
thank

01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
you seeing no questions I want to thank
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I have one more
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
pink card for this public hearing and it
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
is from Mr cof of the conservation law
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
foundation and I noticed you've also
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
filed a card to testify on the next bill
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you would wave off
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh do multiple testimony
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.229 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes because I'm sure you're going to say
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.910 align:start position:0%
so all right
so

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes we have been limited to addressing
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
the bill at hand when we're discussing
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh the bills and if we are if he waves
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
off we will not be able to ask him about
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
this particular bill that's my
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we're doing right
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
correct thank you I I I I'm opposed
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
to having him wave off it's his choice
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
of course but I mean if we can't ask him
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
about this right let's put it to a vote
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of it uh letting Mr
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
Koff testify once on both bills raise
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
hands okay Mr coff you can come up now
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you make it quick we're way behind
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much and I promise
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
to make it very very quick um again Nick
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
R off with the conservation law
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
Foundation um I wasn't planning to
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill today but there was
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
something that the commissioner said uh
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
the PC commissioner said particularly
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner chattai said that I really
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to here today which is
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
really important um so in in the bill in
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the sorry the order order n uh
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
27074 in the net metering docket um you
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
know their conservation law foundation
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
made an argument that basically when
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the benefits of net metering
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
they should also be looking at the
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
environmental public health
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
benefits um the the
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
PC rejected that argument but I I want
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
to focus your attention on the reasoning
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
there they basically said unless the
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
commission is a valuating the financial
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits to raid payers it is
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
not clear how the commission would
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
evaluate cost shifting between customer
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
categories because neither category
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
benefits from the external benefits as a
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
member of that rate they said the
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
commission does not know how it Factor
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
benefits unrelated to reductions in
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
rates into the cost shifting
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and then they said notably
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
while balancing the financial costs and
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
benefits of a program is within the
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
commissional traditional ratemaking
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
Authority looking at benefits and costs
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
outside of that is not in their
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
traditional ratemaking Authority so what
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
what chat what commissioner chatai said
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
was that you know basically they want to
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
look at costs outside of that
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
traditional rate making Authority which
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
is contrary to what was said here I
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
think if they're going to be looking at
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
participant costs not traditional rate
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
making you know cost not traditional
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
cost to rate payers they should also be
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
looking at societal benefits and it's
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
very concerning that they're talking
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
about looking at societal costs but not
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
societal benefits thank you for
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
um any questions for Mr
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
Cot representative
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
Mr cof for coming in so given what you
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
just said uh would it be beneficial to
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh Us in order to vote on this bill to
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
see exactly what factors the Pu would be
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of costs and
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
benefits if they're going to look at
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
traditional rate making then that's not
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
a holistic look if they're going to do a
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
holistic look then maybe we ought to
 
01:30:53.719 --> 01:30:54.510 align:start position:0%
holistic look then maybe we ought to
know

01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
what that entails and what frame they're
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
going to use I mean I would agree I mean
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
I I think it you know it's important to
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
know what they're thinking in terms of
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
societal costs and benefits because you
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
know it does appear to be very one-sided
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
and and I would also note that you know
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
as um as ever sources Witnesses said
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
when they developed the grant state test
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
it was basically a compromise you
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
weren't going to look at societal costs
 
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
weren't going to look at societal
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and here at least a proposal
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard today is to only look at one
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
to thank you and I'm going to close the
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 221 and
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to move directly into a
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing for House Bill 224
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
FN relative to rebates to rate payers
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
from the renewable energy fund and I'll
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
call on the prime sponsor of this
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%

10:24 I don't know if anybody else felt
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
it but we had a little
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
earthquake just putting it out there is
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
4.1 in
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
Nashville inflation has made it harder
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of New Hampshire to get
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
by and this is particularly true among
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
seniors people are concerned about
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
increases in groceries energy costs and
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
these are the areas where constituents
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
really can't fully cut back because they
 
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:30.709 align:start position:0%
really can't fully cut back because they
are

01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
Essentials unfortunately for many of
 
01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
these expenses like groceries and
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
gasoline the legislature doesn't have
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
any leverage in impacting these prices
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
they are set by national or Global
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
markets that are beyond our
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
control so I looked for where we can
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
make an impact and help citizens
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
particularly our seniors who are often
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
on fixed incomes
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses one area where we
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
can help keep a little more money in the
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
pockets of our residents their
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
electricity bill lowering energy costs
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
is an issue I ran on by rebating the
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund back to rate
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
payers we would save them according to
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note between $2.5 and $7.3
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
million per year while that's not going
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
to save each rate payer thousands of
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
dollars each year it's a start and an
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
important step to provide relief from
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
some of the highest electricity costs in
 
01:33:25.719 --> 01:33:26.550 align:start position:0%
some of the highest electricity costs in
the

01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
country this isn't a new concept as this
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee knows well New Hampshire has
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
been rebating funds from our Reggie
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
program for 13 years and has saved rate
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
payers hundreds of millions of dollars
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
over that time frame this bill seeks to
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
do the same for the renewable energy
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
fund and provide important rate payer
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
relief since I've filed this bill a
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
number of organizations have expressed
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
their support for this
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I know that several of them
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
are here today and I look forward to
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
hearing their testimony from the
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
constituencies that they
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
represent and I reserve my right to
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to direct your
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions to them accordingly I
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to find this
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass and give our rate
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
payers the relief they need thank
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative n for
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
introducing this
 
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill I have about 10 pink cards here I'm
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
sorting through them even as I speak to
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
try to find out just
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
exactly who I think we need to hear from
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
next and I think we need to hear next
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
from Josh Elliot at the New Hampshire
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
energy good morning Mr Elliott and
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Josh
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
Elliott I am serve as the Director of
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
the division of policy and programs uh
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
energy uh so the department is uh
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill although some of
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the details were unclear to us is
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
the exact intent uh of the of the
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
language of the bill um given the
 
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
language that is struck out on lines 12
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
through 16 um and then the addition of
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
the language um specifically on lines 16
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
and 17 uh that reads that are in excess
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
of administrative costs and incentive
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
payments so uh if listening to the
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor she introduced the
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill it sounds like the intent would be
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
to rebate any money that comes in from
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the R into the uh the renewable energy
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
fund from alternative compliance
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
payments um although this language does
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
not do that um it does say in excess of
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and incentive
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
payments although the language that is
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
struck out above strikes out the
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
language about incentive uh any
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
incentive payments being made so it's
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
not clear to us what exactly um is the
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
intent if the intent is to uh create
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh relief valve if you will
 
01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
um if there were sort of an anomalous
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
year where I'm making up numbers given
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
that this number has not happened say
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
$30 million were made in alternative
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
compliance payments because of a variety
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
of circumstances beyond the control of
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
this legislature um given that renewable
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
energy certificates uh trade regionally
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
um you know we could see you know
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
working on language to try to figure out
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
okay after you know proper notice and
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
hearing doing something like that so
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's appropriate um um uh input in
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
terms of what that mechanism looks like
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
and what is considered excess um because
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is not clear in the legislation uh
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
as proposed either but we're happy to
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
work with the prime sponsor any other
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to to further
 
01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to to further
refine

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
that okay questions for Mr Elliott Wendy
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
Thomas has one thank you Mr chair um I
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
actually have two economic questions I
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
can do one as a followup um on line
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
it strikes out um that these funds shall
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
be subject to audit
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
so if one reads this bill as is there is
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely no audit oversight on $7.3
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
million is that something that
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy is okay
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
with uh thank you for the question
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes as you as you
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out correctly right that's Str
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
that uh sentence is struck out um if
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
there are uh if the if the intention is
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
to remove any incentive payments
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um I guess all the audit
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
would do would be to say whether or not
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
the money is coming in the same number
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's flowing into the department is
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
the same number flowing out of the
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.750 align:start position:0%
the same number flowing out of the
department

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
um it could be read a couple of
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
different ways in terms of whether or
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
not it doesn't prohibit us from doing it
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
but it certainly removes the specific
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
legislative directive to do it followup
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
followup as a member of the Department
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
of energy can you make a comment on the
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
economic impact of death estimating the
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency industry in New
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if this bill passes um given
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
that I am not fully in aware of the full
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation um I would
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
defer that defer answering that question
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
you additional questions for the
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
Department representative McGee has one
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question Josh good to see you
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I just have a question about
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund usage in other
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
words I'd like to get to what you're
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
doing with that money if it's going to
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
evaporate because as you're aware um the
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor when she testified
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we're already rebating
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money from the regional
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative money which
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
was for Investments this program is also
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
a much smaller program for investment um
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
so what will be the impact of not having
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
any renewable energy fundings for the
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
State uh thank you for the question so I
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
can speak to what the programs that are
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
currently operated out of this fund um
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
so there are uh three rebate programs
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial solar commercial
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
industrial uh wood pellet as well as a
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
residential wood pellet program uh there
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
are two um Grant programs that are
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
currently operating a low moderate
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
income solar uh grant program as well as
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
a non-competitive excuse me a
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
competitive uh commercial industri
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
program um at the direction of the
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
legislature in the last sessions as part
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 303 uh the department is
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
working on a municipal solar program um
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
at the legislature's direction um so
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
that that program has not been fully set
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
up yet and it an operational but that
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
would assumingly assume would uh if this
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass with cl would be
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
disrupted yes it would we would just
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
stop work on that um I would add um this
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
also removes uh the funding for the
 
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry and
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
energy innovation so including all the
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear duties that were passed um a
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
number uh last session um the the office
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
itself would still exist we would just
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
not have a funding stream for
 
01:40:04.159 --> 01:40:06.830 align:start position:0%
not have a funding stream for
it

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
followup so many things going on in my
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
brain right now so the other question
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
that I have is I believe that we also
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
have a bill to consider removing the RPS
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
and my question is if the funding comes
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
from the alternative compliance
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
payments if that bill passes would there
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
be no funding in this fund all coming in
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
it because I'm trying to get it all
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
straight in my head it would depend on
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
structured uh I have a quick question
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
for you rather than
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
rebating the proceeds that are derived
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
payments would it be economically
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
advantageous to eliminate alternative
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
compliance payments altogether and would
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
that stimulate Renewable Energy Credit
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:15.149 align:start position:0%
 
payers

01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
um if you were to eliminate acps right
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
there would be no penalty for financial
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
or otherwise for not purchasing
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates by the
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
utilities and they would just in theory
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
they would buy whatever they could on
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
the open market but there would be no
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
there would be no Financial incentive
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
for the utilities to not purchase
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
them I again it would depend on the
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
details I I would have to think about it
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
a little bit more and see what the a
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
proposal would actually look like okay
 
01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.709 align:start position:0%
proposal would actually look like okay
thank

01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
question yeah um getting to the
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and the alternate
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
complaint liance payments I I believe
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
the goal of the legislation was to have
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
maximizing the amount of renewable
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
energy being produced in New Hampshire
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
so ultimately we would want the
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
alternate compliance payments to go to
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
zero that would mean that uh we don't
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
have we have all the uh renewable energy
 
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
that the law uh is trying to accomplish
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
given that um what percentage of this
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
goes to alternate compliance payments as
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
compared to you know uh goes to I guess
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
you say how much we spending on
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
Alternate compliance payments because
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
that means we're not developing
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy uh to the extent we
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
could or the utilities say it's cheaper
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
to buy alternate make alternative
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
clients payments rather than to provide
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy recks so how much is
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
going to this um thank you for the
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
question so the amount going to
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
Alternative compliance payments varies
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
over the year depending on variety of of
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
factors that are outside of uh the
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
Department's control or even this
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislature's control um in terms of um
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
how those renewable energy certificates
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
are bought and sold on an open market um
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
last year go ahead uh last year um I'm
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
trying to remember off the top of my
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
head it was in our renewable energy fund
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh annual report which I'm happy to
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee uh again the um
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
I want to say was somewhere around5 or
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
$6 million um as compos as opposed to
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
the the cost of the renewable energy
 
01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
certificates um that were acquired by
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
the utilities um you know we're
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
probably trying to remember off the time
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
top of my head probably about six times
 
01:43:30.719 --> 01:43:33.070 align:start position:0%
top of my head probably about six times
that

01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
number yeah could you provide I know you
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
can't do it up the top of your head
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
could you provide us the the value of
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy recck credits and
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
the alternate compliance payments for
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
the last five years and you you submit
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
it to us please thank yes I can do
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
that representative rolds has a
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
question sorry thank than you Mr
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I think that the
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
concepts the concepts and the policy
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
instruments that we're discussing here
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
are getting a little bit
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
confused um Mr Elliot isn't it true that
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
obviously as the uh renewable en the
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that the utilities
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
acquire certain percentage of renewable
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
energy certificates is really a stand in
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the utilities acquiring a certain
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
fraction of their electricity
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
Supply directly from renewable
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
sources yes so those renewable energies
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay certificates yes are the are the
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes of of electricity
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's produced yes and isn't it true
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the alternate compliance payments
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
is a policy instrument that was designed
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
as a cap a price cap tap on that so that
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
the utilities would not be required to
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
pay you know some ungodly price for
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
renewable energy instead of paying say
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
$100 a megawatt hour they might they can
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
instead make an alternative compliance
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
payment to the fund and then that fund
 
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.189 align:start position:0%
payment to the fund and then that fund
is

01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
used to support other people developing
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy yes that is correct
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions representative
 
01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:29.750 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions representative

parshall
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for being here today
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
A recent Stanford study places another
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
30 40 years uh before natural gas and
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
toing reserves are
 
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.430 align:start position:0%
toing reserves are
exhausted

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
um putting the Val um with surrounding
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
states investing heavily in
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
Renewables if New Hampshire steps away
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
from this Market will they not put us as
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
a dis over the next four decades and our
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
ability to compete in the energy
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
Market uh given that that I have not
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
read that study I'm not aware of that
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
study I'd be happy to take a look at it
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
if you send it to me um I'd love to uh
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's a uh this sort of fundamentally
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
comes down as a policy decision for the
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislature depending on what how they
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
want to do this um in terms of peak Peak
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
natural gas or Peak whatever fuel
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
happens to be um I'm I am not an expert
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
in in that area so I unfortunately I
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
can't offer an opinion on that now in
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
terms of what are you asking what in
 
01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
terms of the the impact would be on the
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy Market within the
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
state in terms of
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
the I allow to clarify yes clarify
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
please yes I'm uh I'm looking at Vermont
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
that has 100% renewable at this point uh
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
Maine has uh 63% I believe and um
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're getting their energy basically
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
for free compared to what being 45% of
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
our energy being DED from natural gas
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
and that's that's going to have extreme
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
volatility for down down the
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
future um with volatile prices like that
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
well will that be a discouraging uh
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
businesses say from coming to our state
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
because our in prices will continue to
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
be high particularly in terms of what
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
other states surrounding us are doing so
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
the the question has wandered into
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
territory that is outside the scope of
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
this bill so you respectfully don't have
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
to answer answer that okay thank you I
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
want to be respectful the committee's
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative Kaplan do
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
you have a question that's about the
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I mean this this uh yeah thank
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and and thank you Mr
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
Elliott uh this this bill would
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
essentially cancel out the the uh the
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
compli the U the renewable energy fund
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
which is based on compliance payments uh
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
so what effect would that have on the on
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
our um ability to integrate additional
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources or even clean
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
energy sources in our
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
state it would uh the impact would be
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
those those programs that I I outlined
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh in response to I apologize I can't
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
remember if it was representative oh
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's question um would
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh with sunset uh in terms of the gross
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
impact on terms of of New Hampshire
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
itself um I can't say particularly in
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
terms of you know how many projects
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
would not get down how many you know
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
what in terms of the larger impact of
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
the grid I could not I could not answer
 
01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:27.350 align:start position:0%
the grid I could not I could not answer
that

01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
question all right seeing no more
 
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank uh Mr Elliott
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
for giving us the Department's
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
perspective we're running out of time
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of people who want to
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
speak so we're going to have to start uh
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
implementing a limit time limit on
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so next I want to call on John
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
Reynolds represent of Amherst New
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
nfib NH and I am sure he will tell us
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%

have three minutes please I'll be uh try
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
to be much briefer uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
John Reynolds with the national
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
Federation of Independent Business of
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh that's why we
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
abbreviate it uh nfib New Hampshire
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
represents over 1,700 small businesses
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
across the state in every size every
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
industry um and our mission is to
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
promote protect the right of our members
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
to own operate and grow their business
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
um every four years nfib surveys our
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
members every four years since 1982
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
we've surveyed our members on their
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
biggest uh problems and priorities we
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
put 75 issues in front of them and ask
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
them to rank them so you can imagine
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to get a response uh when
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
you put 75 issues in front of people but
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's been an emergence recently as
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've heard from lots of your
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
constituents uh in the concern of the
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
cost of energy so both uh Transportation
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
fuels and heating fuels and the cost of
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
electric rates have entered the top 10
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
in the most recent Edition which was
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
published last year and earlier this
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
year earlier this month we surveyed New
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire small businesses um on whether
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
they believed policy makers should focus
 
01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
on reliability and affordability
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
accelerate the deployment of Renewables
 
01:50:14.589 --> 01:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
or something else and 87% of small
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
business owners said that the top policy
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
priority should be affordability and
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
reliability um I would also note that in
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
the at the federal level the 2022
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act uh included in
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
the climate and clean energy provisions
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
of that bill uh nearly a trillion or
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
over a trillion dollars worth of value
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
for alternative energy renewable energy
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
um and Energy Efficiency projects
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
according to a Penn Warton study um
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's compared to the original $380
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
billion 10year
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
estimate and while we recognize as
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative ner said uh while we
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that hb24 doesn't solve the
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
entire affordability problem uh it will
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
give small business owners a little
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
break on their electric bills and that's
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
why we support the bill so again thank
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for your time and I
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh representative n
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you representative
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank you Mr
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking U my
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
question would you say that even though
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
it's a small step it's a step in the
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
right direction at least it shows
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
businesses that would try and do the
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
best we can even that we don't have
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
control over a lot of electrical
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
expenses is any step in the right
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
direction sending a message to
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
businesses that New Hampshire's trying
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
to do what it can I think uh we
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree with that and in my
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh e effort to trim down the time of my
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I think I omitted the fact
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
that this is a small step in the right
 
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
direction thank you representative
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you Mr
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
question uh so the fiscal note says that
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years AP ACP Revenue
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
has varied between 2.5 and 7.3
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
million so in terms of how that would
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
affect a an independent Independent
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
Business given its share of the rebate
 
01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
what actual effect would that have on a
 
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
typical Independent Business are we
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking about um the ability of the
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
business to stay afloat or hire more
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
people or just make more profit for the
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
owners what is the actual impact to a
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
business uh for our members thank you
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
for the question Mr chair um and
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Corman uh you know for
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
our members I think any money that uh
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
comes back to them through relief from
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
the state right is money that they're
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
most likely going to invest back in
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
their business or into their employees
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
um and so whether it's $100 or $200 or
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
$500 or $1,000 um you know that's
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
probably where the savings is going and
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
I I think of when I think of res uh
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
small businesses independent businesses
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
that would benefit the most from this I
 
01:52:45.629 --> 01:52:45.639 align:start position:0%
think of you know places like
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh small independent grocery
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
stores right that have uh typically very
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
high energy costs
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
or where where energy is one of their
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know largest expenses representative
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you uh Mr chair um
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here can you please
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
give me um the percentage of your small
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
business clients that have taken
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of the New Hampshire saves
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
programs and its offerings uh thank you
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the question representative Thomas
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
Mr that doesn't really apply to this
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill you don't you don't have to answer
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
it if you don't want I I don't have the
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of that I we haven't asked
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
our members that question so I don't
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
have an answer to that question
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
rals thank you Mr chairman well I was
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to ask a similar question but
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
directly related to the bill because do
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
you know how many um in small businesses
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have taken advantage of
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund to do projects
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
I mean when I drive around the state I
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
see a lot of small
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
roofs um installations where there's
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
solar energy so your members are are
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
participating do you have a sense of the
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
numbers I uh don't have a sense Mr chair
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh and representative rolds uh I don't
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how many members
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
participate in those programs um but
 
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
again I would refer back to our survey
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
from earlier this month that said 87%
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the top priority should be
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
affordability and
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
reliability okay we'd like to move on
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
here because we have a lot of people we
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
want to hear from up next we'll hear
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
from Mark froing of fr in
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
energy good morning Mr Fring nice to see
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
you again I was just passing by one of
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
your facilities in Keen yesterday oh oh
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay I was there yesterday working on a
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
Sunday um thank you so much Mr Bose
 
01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:39.950 align:start position:0%
Sunday um thank you so much Mr Bose
representative

01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
W um I run a small Renewable Energy
 
01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
company and we install uh wood pallet
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
boilers and wood chip boilers throughout
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the several different states and we are
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
um obviously uh you know in all
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
transparency we're a big beneficiary of
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
um the fund the renewable energy fund
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
that um gives out grants uh to not to us
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily but to our clients and so
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
then we get work from that fund and that
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
has helped us grow to a 30 uh sorry to a
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
20 person Company by now and um we also
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh because we have um manufactured or
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
started to manufacture Uh Wood fuel fuel
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
over the years we also um sell the wood
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
fuel throughout the states and our
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
biggest client is actually um
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and counties and
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
jails and hospitals and nursing homes
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that and they all
 
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of this wreck money that they
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
receive and we have um we we sell about
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
or we broker about um 20% of the Recs
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
that are actually generated by this fund
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit under half a million dollar
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
and so that has helped all of our
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
clients and actually our clients are the
 
01:55:59.790 --> 01:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
biggest beneficiaries of these things
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
and so looking at that it doesn't seem
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
very logical what this bill is doing
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
because you are giving the rate payers
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
the money or you're intending to give
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
the rate payers the money back but in
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
fact uh the people that are really
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
benefiting is the state and the
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
communities and the
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so in the future they
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
when you take these funding
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities away they would cost more
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
and who is the state but ourselves and
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
so then we would have to pay more taxes
 
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
into that so you're sort of taking it
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
out of one pocket and then putting it
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
into another pocket and that to me seems
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
not the intent of this um fund this fund
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
is really to reduce greenhouse gases and
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do and um I
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill but thank you
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
so much for your time and
 
01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you any questions
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr froling
 
01:56:52.599 --> 01:56:54.030 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr froling
representative

01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
rold thank you Mr chairman um hearkening
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
prior uh
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses uh Mantra you know that small
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
businesses everyone is seeking you know
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
affordable and reliable energy yeah uh
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that the grants from the
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund provide you know
 
01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh a fraction of the of the capital cost
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the installation of your equipment
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
are the are your are your C are your
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
clients installing wood pellet and wood
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
chip boilers because they believe
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
that having that equipment as their main
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
source of heating for the next 30 Years
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
is going to give them affordable and
 
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.910 align:start position:0%
is going to give them affordable and
reliable

01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
energy yes yes that's exactly who our
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
customers are so I will give you a
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
really really discreet um example um our
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
local chesher County nurse ing home um
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
is a project where they were spending
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year on fuel oil in the past
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
to heat their facilities and then during
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
a very large major remodel of the entire
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home um they reduced their
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
annual hiting bills down to
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
$80,000 and this fund was um I'm not I
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
think it was 300,000 or maybe
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
$325,000 um grant money that was part of
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
generated from this fund and then
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
additionally to that they're also
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
getting the Rex and because of that the
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home and the entire chesher
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
County complexes are the beneficiaries
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
of that and that actually helps our
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
community so it's not just sort of um
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's a great um it's a
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
great fund for us for sure and I am a
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of that because that's how I
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
make my living but also the the people
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the state are the beneficiaries
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
because they are getting the savings
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
from from the fuel that we're providing
 
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
at half the cost of oil so it's a much
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
greater impact than the $2 you're
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
getting back as as a rate paay okay
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much let's move on next
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
I'll call up Mr Greg Moore from
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
Americans for
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and uh you asked for four
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm afraid I'm GNA have to give

01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
components um I agree with the chairman
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
I think that a better solution to to
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
resolving this might just to be to bring
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
the ACP down to zero uh that takes takes
 
01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
out takes out the challenge of giving
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu having to develop a mechanism in
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
order to rebate this money back to the
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
right players it seems like a more a
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
simpler solution which legislatively I
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
always like simpler Solutions um I'd
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
also like to point out the fiscal note
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
raised a good point about the the office
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind industry development
 
02:00:00.119 --> 02:00:02.270 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind industry development
energy

02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
Innovation um given the fact that that
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
the new Administration signed an
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
executive order uh basically putting an
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
end to development of wind energy uh it
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
this this uh Bill actually flagged for
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
the for the committee something that
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
another action you might want to take
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
considering that uh at least probably
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
for the next four years that's not going
 
02:00:24.669 --> 02:00:24.679 align:start position:0%
to be a real viable option and we're
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
spending at a cost of
 
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
125,000 uh while I agree with the prime
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor we come at this bill a little
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
bit differently our focus is on overall
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
State competitiveness if you hear me
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
speaking in front of legislative
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
committees you'll usually hear me talk
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
about State competitiveness and we want
 
02:00:41.069 --> 02:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
to do everything we can to make New
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the obvious choice for people
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
to come to whether it's individuals
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
businesses Etc so anything we can do to
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
take small steps in that direction we
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
think is a is a good and viable one we
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to consider this
 
02:00:56.589 --> 02:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and U I'll I'll be short
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
I'll give you two minutes happy to take
 
02:00:58.639 --> 02:00:59.629 align:start position:0%
I'll give you two minutes happy to take
any

02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you we had someone who
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
testified earlier state that a survey of
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
the members of his organization the
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
small business New Hampshire Independent
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
Business Association 87% of the members
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
said that their top energy priority was
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
affordability and reliability do you
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
have any similar statistics for members
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
of your organization we have not
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
surveyed our members on on this topic so
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
I I can't say that I have anything
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
conrete I will tell you that uh I spend
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
time talking to uh individuals as well
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
as business owners every day and uh
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
energy is a huge huge issue particularly
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
I was talking with somebody who has
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
businesses in Massachusetts New
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine and he talks about
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh as they do what he
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
calls a spreadsheet Olympics which is
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
laying out all hoc caust associated with
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
each state to try to understand where he
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
wants to sort of locate his business he
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
said that in his in his interpretation
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is making the right
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and it's and it seems like the
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
Gap is widening in as he describes at
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet Olympics making New
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more and more attractive every
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
day good that's a good feedback thank
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
you any further questions uh
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative Swanson has
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
one maybe I lost track of the thread
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
there but uh uh if New Hampshire is
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
getting more attractive any every day
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
how would getting you know how would
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill make it even more attractive
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
when it seems like the consequences of
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
investing in Renewables is making New
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
attractive uh representative I would I
 
02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:45.639 align:start position:0%
would point out that uh New England as a
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
whole has some of the highest energy
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
costs electricity costs in the country
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
the the US Department of energy uh eia
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh Energy Information agency typically
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
puts New Hampshire between the fourth
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
and sixth most expensive and and when
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
you take out Alaska and Hawaii who have
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
their own unique electricity challenges
 
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
we typically fall between between the
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
second and and the fifth highest
 
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
electricity cost in any given time it's
 
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
a huge problem I look for example at Sig
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
sour uh when they decided to make an
 
02:03:20.669 --> 02:03:20.679 align:start position:0%
Ammunition plant uh they as you know
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
they they manufactur lot of firearms out
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the Sea Coast but when they were
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
looking to do a manufacturing an
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
Ammunition plant they cited the high
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity now they want to be
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
here they love New Hampshire they want
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
to be here but they cited the high cost
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
of electricity as the reason why they
 
02:03:39.149 --> 02:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
cited their Ammunition plant in
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
Arkansas following question follow up as
 
02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.430 align:start position:0%
Arkansas following question follow up as
a

02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:03:49.229 --> 02:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
homeowner who's invested in my solar
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
system I have found that since Ming back
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire in the first year and a
 
02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
half a question please okay uh well I
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
had power failures but after I installed
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
my own system I no longer have power
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
outage I don't have those you know I
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
have reliability I have where's your
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
question please and my question is as
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
follows what is the statistic as far as
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
what is the impact of the cost of the
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
current program relative to driving up
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
rates because that does seem like the
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
assertion well according to the fiscal
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
note um it says that in the last few
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
years that cost has been Associated
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
between 2.5 and $7.3 million that has
 
02:04:36.549 --> 02:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
been added on to to rate payers uh I
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
will say this as someone who just
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
recently uh replaced a f a gas furnace
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh by the way always a good idea if
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to replace a gas furnace do
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
it in the summertime not in the winter
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
but I replaced it with an ultra high
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency one and I did it because it
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
was going to save me money
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't need a government program to do
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
that I did it because it was going to
 
02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
save me money in the long run thank you
 
02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.390 align:start position:0%
save me money in the long run thank you
Mr

02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
chair representative Kaplan has a
 
02:05:03.149 --> 02:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
you for coming in Mr Moore uh and based
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
on on your uh on your comment just just
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
the the latest comment about needing uh
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
you know government help to to take
 
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
those kind of steps to save electricity
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
and or energy and your own home um as as
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
a member of a community whose High
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
School took advantage of the wood p
 
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
boiler program to lower its operating
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
cost and therefore save the entire
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
community on its property taxes which is
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
a huge issue for our state um would you
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
would your
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
membership acknowledge the value in
 
02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
terms of our competitiveness relative to
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
other states of having viable
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
communities and having an educated
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
through line but uh I will say that I
 
02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
will say that that uh if projects makes
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
sense very frequently people will engage
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
in those projects because they make
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
Financial sense our town of our town of
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
B Bedford has bonded out several Energy
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects I'm not aware of
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
them getting funding uh from the state
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
maybe they have maybe they haven't but
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
we did it because it was going to save
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.629 --> 02:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair um you
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned specifically the executive
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
order on Banning offshore wind in New
 
02:06:25.629 --> 02:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you said that there's not
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to be anything for the next four
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
years so we shouldn't look at it are you
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
aware of the many legal challenges that
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
are currently being filed against that
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
EO I am that question doesn't relate to
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
the bill so you don't have to answer
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
that if you
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
don't representative parshall thank you
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here today
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
um this
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
bill will remove I believe correct me if
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong we'll remove some of our fuel
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
diversity from our mix and I tend to see
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity as stabilization of our
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
electric rates would you agree with well
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want to make me
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
um could you see a situation where not
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
having fuel diversity can make us less
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
competitive among our neighbor States oh
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think this this committee has has done
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
great move forward greatly in the notion
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
of fuel diversity I think the work that
 
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
that this committee has done in the area
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
of nuclear has been exceptional and is
 
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
frankly a leader uh not just not just
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
regionally but nationally so I I think
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
that you guys are doing a great job and
 
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find good fuel
 
02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
diversity thank you okay saying no
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
further questions I want to thank Mr Mo
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
for being here and pleas next call
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
on Miss Heidi koll representing the
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
granite state Hy Hydro Power Association
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
and Miss CR I know you asked for five to
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
six minutes I'm afraid I'm going to have
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
to limit you to three
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time but welcome and
 
02:07:58.109 --> 02:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see you again good morning
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee um I will try to be as brief
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
as possible uh my name is Heidi croll I
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
work at um J gmis strategic Solutions
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on uh today on behalf of
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
the Granite State Hydro Power
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
Association um we are opposed to uh this
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill um and as I from what I understand
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
um from the uh Prime sponsor's um
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
description of her intent with it um the
 
02:08:23.470 --> 02:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy um fund is a
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated dedicated
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund funded by alternative
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
compliance payments and as a general
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
principle dedicated funds should not be
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
used for purposes for which they were
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
not established or intended um when the
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislature design the RPS the renewable
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
energy fund was seen as a critical
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
feature not only in helping to increase
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the supply of renewable energy in New
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also in lowering the RPS
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
compliance cost um the renewable energy
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
fund is um intended to help support and
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
promote all types of uh new
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based renewable energy
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
projects uh in terms of size Renewable
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
Fuel customer class and this helps
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase the supply of renewable energy
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
certificates thereby bringing the cost
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
of RPS compliance down because load
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
serving entities don't have to pay the
 
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
ACP which is the cealing price and which
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh therefore is the highest price um doe
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
as you heard from uh Mr Elliott uh uses
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
the funds from the renewable energy fund
 
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
to administer several rebate programs a
 
02:09:25.149 --> 02:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
low-income grant program and a
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program for
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
non-residential renewable energy
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
projects that are not eligible for any
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
of the other programs um the renewable
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
energy fund leverages significant
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
private investment in new and existing
 
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy resources according to
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
the Doe's November 2024 report the
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
programs funded by the renewable energy
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
fund since in since Inception have
 
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
leveraged private investment by ratio of
 
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
over 6 to1 which means for every $1 of
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
ref they're getting $6 in private
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
investment um a number of hydro
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
facilities throughout New Hampshire have
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
competed for and been awarded grants
 
02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
under the um commercial and Industrial
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program which is again
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the only one the only program that they
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
are eligible for um and these grants
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
have provided U small but meaningful
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
contribution to a variety of projects at
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
existing Hydro facilities that have
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
helped improve efficiencies so that
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
these plants are able to generate more
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
power and more renewable energy
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
certificates um these renewable energy
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
certificates have generally been class 4
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
but in a few cases have been class one
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
wrecks because the facilities were
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
either substantially overhauled um or in
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
one case was actually a new
 
02:10:41.679 --> 02:10:44.669 align:start position:0%
one case was actually a new
facility

02:10:44.669 --> 02:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
um I will say that we strongly agree
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
with the conclusions in the Doe's
 
02:10:52.549 --> 02:10:52.559 align:start position:0%
November 2024 report that state in part
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to quote here as this
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
report illustrates demand for rebates
 
02:10:59.790 --> 02:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
and Grant Awards continues to be strong
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
rebate and Grant funds have leveraged
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
over 460 million in private investment
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
providing a boost to the state's economy
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
and creating jobs for electricians
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
plumbers and Alternative Energy
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
businesses in addition there has been
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
substantial growth in distributed energy
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
generation uh renewable energy systems
 
02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
that serve to diversify our energy
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
Supply reduce our reliance on fossil
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
and increase our energy Independence so
 
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:28.599 align:start position:0%
we hope that the renewable energy funds
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
continue to be Ed for their intended
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
purpose and thank you for your time I
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm out of time Mr chairman I want
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
to say two very quick things one my
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
quick back of the envelope math is that
 
02:11:41.790 --> 02:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
if there are $5 million in renewable
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
0.4 per kwh or 0.4
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
per kwh on a rate of 17 cents which I
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
think is probably on the low side uh
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is a. 2% reduction um if you gave
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
all of that money back the other thing I
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to say there was a comment made
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
earlier that just go with a$ Z ACP that
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
will completely really wipe the RPS off
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
the books because no Lo load serving
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
entity is going to go out and buy a
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
wreck when they know they can just make
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
a z ACP so with that I'm happy to answer
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
any questions and I appreciate your time
 
02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative PL
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
has one uh thank you chair this is to
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
the chair could uh Miss Crow Supply
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
electronic of her testimony to us I'm
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
sure she would if we uh would like it so
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
yes consider yourself requested sure
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes uh representative
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
Harrington ask a question yeah thank you
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so it
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
seems like what you're saying is that
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
your clients make more more money so
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
that someone who's let's say retired
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
lives in a small apartment on a fixed
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
income they're going to pay a higher
 
02:12:59.790 --> 02:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
electric rate so your clients can make
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
more profits that's that's your
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
position um no my my position is that
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
the renewable uh energy fund is a
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated dedicated n
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Ling fund that was created for a purpose
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
um and we think the RPS does serve an
 
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
important purpose um hydros participate
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
in in the RPS program um you may not
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
have been here the day that U madin
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
minow and I presented but um New
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hydr also serve a lot of other
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
important um Public Safety and societal
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefits um we maintain um and operate
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
many dams in New Hampshire with private
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
dollars um that are not um if those
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
costs weren't being borne by the private
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
sector they would be born by taxpayers
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
and we know that we have a substantial
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire um with the
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
state-owned dams and trying to figure
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
out how to fund um maintenance and
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
operation of those so representative
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming in uh Miss
 
02:14:06.669 --> 02:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
croll um you mentioned and your and at
 
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
the end of your comments that if the RPS
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
was to fold up based on you know
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments going
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
down to zero uh what effect would that
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
have on your membership and secondly
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
what effect would that have on the
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
state's ability to meet its energy needs
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
so um as we testif as we presented um we
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh came to your committee a couple weeks
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
ago in the granite state hydrop Power
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
Association and I testified um the RPS
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
revenue is an important Revenue stream
 
02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
for the hydro facilities here in New
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again um we uh there are
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
requirements in the RPS about uh those
 
02:14:45.629 --> 02:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
facilities their size their fist passage
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
requirements other um criteria that need
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
to be met um it's an important Revenue
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
stream given the
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
um uh expenses and the burdens
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and otherwise that Hydro
 
02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
facilities um face and so um you know it
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh for some of the smaller ones
 
02:15:08.549 --> 02:15:08.559 align:start position:0%
for sure it could be uh a significant
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
impact to lose that Revenue um I'm sorry
 
02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
lost your second question what you
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
therefore what impact would that have on
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
our state's ability to meet its energy
 
02:15:20.549 --> 02:15:20.559 align:start position:0%
needs um well I mean I think the
 
02:15:20.559 --> 02:15:21.709 align:start position:0%
needs um well I mean I think the
diversity

02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh for New Hampshire is important it's
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
very important um and in keeping prices
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
low for consumers and also um you know
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
every little bit of Supply helps and in
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
the case of hydro um pretty much run 247
 
02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
as long as there's uh run of river there
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and for hydro facilities that have um uh
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
reservoirs they're able to run 247 using
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
that Reservoir so it's serves as um a
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
base load type um Supply as well as
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
peing when they have the
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
reservoir thank you Miss Groll we
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate your test testimony and next
 
02:16:01.149 --> 02:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Charlie
 
02:16:01.159 --> 02:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Charlie
nebling

02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
yes did you have a question I did oh
 
02:16:11.950 --> 02:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question I
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
guess thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
Miss croll um so what struck me about
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony is that you mentioned the
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
fact fact that um the low income low
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
income and competitive Grant programs
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
leverage private investment right so
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's a force multiplier for example and
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
then you mentioned that in the November
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
2024 RF report where you concluded that
 
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
or it concluded that demand is strong
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
you said that 460 million in private
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
investment had been um used as a result
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we have this RF program
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh as a catalyst
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
so uh it sounds to me as though this is
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
a program that um is doing what New
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has always tried to do well
 
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
which is Cobble
 
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
together uh programs that spend very
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
little but give us a much bigger benefit
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so I wonder if you could say
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
anything from your familiarity with the
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
small hydros you did mention briefly um
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
about some Investments that they had
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
made but if you could just talk about uh
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
the margins that these businesses have
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
because as you mentioned they're
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
providing us far more benefit by
 
02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
maintaining things that would have to be
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
paid for another way right so it's a
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
complex issue it's not you'll get four
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
cents back and so that's good that's
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
better it's all these other things
 
02:17:44.669 --> 02:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
you're trying to quantify so I would
 
02:17:46.830 --> 02:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
like to understand a a little bit more
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
about the the amount of money that gets
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
invested in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of a program like
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
this so I yes I was quoting and this is
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
in the conclusion section of the um most
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
recent uh report that Doe put out on the
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and I think um you
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
heard that Mr Elliott is going to be
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
supplying that to the committee so it's
 
02:18:11.709 --> 02:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
toward the end and what it indicated
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
that was that rebate and Grant funds
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
have leveraged over
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
46060 million in private investment so
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
that number is coming from them um I can
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
get you more details on the various um
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
facilities Hydro facilities that have um
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
so they compete um they submit an RFP uh
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
or a proposal in response to the RFP
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy puts out
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they're selected sometimes
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
they're not but a competitive process um
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
and then they um get a small amount of
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
money from the renewable energy fund
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's typically been you know in the
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
range of about maybe 125 to
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
$175,000 um um significantly leveraged
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
um with the hydro owner's own money um
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
to do these types of projects which um
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
one of the key things um for any of
 
02:19:04.509 --> 02:19:04.519 align:start position:0%
projects that participate in any of
 
02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
these programs is that um it has to the
 
02:19:09.389 --> 02:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
project has to result in additional
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates so the
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
idea is that that is intended to
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
increase the supply of renewable energy
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
certificates to help bring down the cost
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
of compliance um so I hope that answers
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
your question a little bit and I can
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
follow up with you later thank you okay
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
next we'll hear from Charlie
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
nebling of
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
bosan haven't seen you in a while
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
Charlie uh my name is Charlie nebling
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
semi-retired Forester and renewable
 
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.230 align:start position:0%
semi-retired Forester and renewable
energy

02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
consultant I was quite involved in the
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
enactment of the RPS back in 2007 House
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
Bill a
 
02:19:55.469 --> 02:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
73 and in particular in the in the um
 
02:19:59.230 --> 02:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
specific um uh policy directives around
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
the adoption of a renewable energy fund
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
to be capitalized by alternative
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
compliance payments so I have some
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
history with the with the statute and
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
its implementation in the 16 or 17 years
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
now that it's been
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
functional I'm here opposed to the bill
 
02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:18.309 align:start position:0%
functional I'm here opposed to the bill
today

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't I profess to not fully
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose of the bill at
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
least based on the the prime sponsor's
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and what the language of the
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill says they seem to be at somewhat at
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
odds I think
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I just to to representative
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington's uh question or comment
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
earlier and and Heidi spoke to this the
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fund is to support
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy techn technologies that
 
02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
renewable energy techn technologies that
generate

02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
generate
 
02:20:57.870 --> 02:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
recks so that the compliance entities uh
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
the competitive suppliers and regulated
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
utilities are able to secure sufficient
 
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
recks in the marketplace to meet their
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
statutory obligation without having to
 
02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
make an alternative compliance payment
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
so every one of the programs that the
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the Pu before
 
02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
them have implemented are intended to
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
generate more wrecks into the
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and help the RPS fulfill its
 
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
purposes its public policy purposes I
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
just want to emphasize that and also
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
this fund and its source of funding is
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
virtually the same in every state that
 
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
has an RPS program something like 29
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
states have alternative compliance
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms and then use that money to
 
02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
help generate additional renewable
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
energy the last comment I'd like to make
 
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is to remind the committee
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we we are I believe the second most
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
dependent state in the country in terms
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the proportion of energy met by
 
02:22:05.790 --> 02:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels second only to Hawaii we
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
export three to four billion dollars a
 
02:22:10.590 --> 02:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
year for the energy that we import
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
because we don't produce fossil fuels in
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
our state what we do produce is
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and every dollar that
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
goes to support in instate renewable
 
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
development is a dollar not being
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
exported to some other state or some
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
other country around the world and that
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
has a significant multiplier impact on
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
our state economy $ 3 to4 billion doll a
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
year is one and a. half to 2% of our
 
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
Gross State product so it's not
 
02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:43.070 align:start position:0%
Gross State product so it's not
insignificant

02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm surprised that the representative
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy did not or
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
that a question was not asked about the
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
current fund balance in the renewable
 
02:22:57.309 --> 02:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
energy fund it's actually over $20
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
million and I think a more appropriate
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
line of inquiry for the committee to
 
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
consider through this bill is how was
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
that fund allowed to acrw a $20 million
 
02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
balance why was it not fully deployed to
 
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
its intended purposes and what more can
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
be done to make sure that it's expended
 
02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
cost effectively to meet meet the goals
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the renewable portfolio standard it
 
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately far greater benefit will be
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
realized through that approach than
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
through the approach proposed by the
 
02:23:35.309 --> 02:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
Mr nebling and Mr Elliott if you could
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
um get us information about the current
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
balance of the renewable energy fund
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate that okay questions for
 
02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.790 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate that okay questions for
Mr

02:23:47.790 --> 02:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
nebling seeing none we'll move move
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
along and get the perspective of clean
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire by inviting Sam
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown to give us his uh his take
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Sam Evans Brown
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
executive director of clean energy New
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire many of the points that I
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
would make have been made already so
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try to not repeat things that have
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
been said um I will just note that that
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh according to the 5-year dedicated
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
funds report that has been submitted uh
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
from the Department to the department
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
well uh that has been submitted I'll
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
just leave it as uh a uh uh um unclear
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
as to who submitted and where until I'm
 
02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
sure uh year ending balance in 2022 was
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
9.6 million it grew to 15.3 million in
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
2023 and in 2024 it had expanded to 20.9
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
million we have been flagging this for
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
members of the fiscal committee for a
 
02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
couple years now and the response that
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the Department of
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
energy is that ACP Revenue can be
 
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and so they didn't want to
 
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
overcommit uh I think it's pretty clear
 
02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
that they've they've uh corrected in the
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
wrong direction and are not getting the
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
money out the door quickly enough I
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
would humbly agree with uh Mr nebling
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
that that the appropriate response here
 
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that the department of
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
energy is budgeting the appropriate
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
amount into the program as is intended
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
and in fact mandated by the statute that
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
governs the renewable energy fund and
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS um I will I will just say you
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
know this the RPS is intended to be a
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
self-balancing policy so when there are
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
not enough renewable energy credits
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments are paid
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
which then are which then fund new
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
projects that create more renewable
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
energy credits which then drives down
 
02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
the cost of compliance with the RPS um
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
and and if you take away one part of
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
that mechanism the policy is simply not
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to work and RPS compliance costs
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
are simply going to rise uh and new
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generation is not going
 
02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
to be not going to be built so uh the
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
the two really work hand inand um I
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
would also note I did my own back of the
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
napkin math uh my my maths show that for
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
the average residential rate payer in
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the RPS compliance costs
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
around $5 a year which I don't think are
 
02:25:59.950 --> 02:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
the thing that is the thing that's going
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
to make people move to New Hampshire or
 
02:26:04.110 --> 02:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
not based on based on the energy costs
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh certainly New England does have H
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
very high uh electricity rates I would
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
argue that the our sort of fundamental
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
geography are what drive that the lack
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
of resources here for us to take
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the lack of infrastructure
 
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
to deliver that energy to New Hampshire
 
02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
and so going after programs like this is
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
not going to solve the problem and the
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
last thing i' note is that while the
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
costs of the RPS are very clearly
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
enumerated uh you know and are in fact
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
laid out in many regulatory filings uh
 
02:26:33.269 --> 02:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
the benefits are nowhere are not
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
enumerated anywhere so we had a long
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
Bill hearing previously about the cost
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefit tests of the new H save program
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
the RPS doesn't doesn't have such a test
 
02:26:42.510 --> 02:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
we simply have an accounting of the
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
costs with no accounting of the benefits
 
02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
and all of these renewable energy
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
projects that get built have benefits to
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
our to our electricity prices they
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
depress Regional wholesale prices on the
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
market and if we were to eliminate these
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
resources from our grid mix electricity
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
rates would likely Rise by some
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminate amount that we have never
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for so um this is a very
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
modest program this is a very small
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money you're not going to make
 
02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
a huge difference in anyone's lives by
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
rebating it back to them you will uh
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
have a a devastating impact on many pro
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh projects that are relying on these
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
funds uh and it's unclear why that's a
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
good idea I'll just note uh New
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire clean en New Hampshire has our
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
energy circuit Riders program which are
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
sort of pro bono technical assistant
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
that work on behalf of municipalities to
 
02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
help them do energy projects that will
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
save their taxpayers money we are aware
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
of over a hundred Municipal solar
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
projects that are in the works right now
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
many of which have been have started to
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
advance because they knew that funding
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
was available through the renewable
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
energy fund the department of energy has
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
repeatedly signaled that they're going
 
02:27:43.710 --> 02:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
to be taking this money and creating a
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
new competitive Municipal solar grant
 
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
program uh and so those projects are
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
advancing on the understanding that
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
those funds are going to be available uh
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
and like I said there's there's over a
 
02:27:55.469 --> 02:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
hundred of them now that we're tracking
 
02:27:57.790 --> 02:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
so with that I think I will take any
 
02:27:59.469 --> 02:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh by what basis did
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
you use to come over that $5 a year
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
Savings in terms of uh how many kilowatt
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
hours per month did you use and what was
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
rate saving so the average New Hampshire
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
residential rate pair uses 660 kilowatt
 
02:28:20.429 --> 02:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
hours a month and so when you when you
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
take the the numbers that Heidi croll uh
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier which are from the
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
the filings that that um that the
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
utilities make regarding the cost of RPS
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
compliance it's around you know 03 cents
 
02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour times 660 I think is
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
the the you know that may be off a tiny
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
napkin okay seeing no further questions
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
we want to thank you for being here and
 
02:28:48.429 --> 02:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on Jason stock of the
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
Timberland Owners Association to give us
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
this good morning and welcome back to
 
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
stn haven't seen you in a while it's
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
been a while well good morning um some
 
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
new faces of I'll be really brief
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
because I know you're crunched for time
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
but for the record I'm Jason stock I'm
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
we represent the forest products
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
industry Timberland owners and um I've
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
come today to to speak in opposition to
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
this bill we actually have members that
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
small business members that actually
 
02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs I can name
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
three off the top of my head Britain
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
Lumber and bath they put in a biomass a
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
biomass boiler to generate heat for
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
their dry killing operation for them
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's a great fit because it utilizes a
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
sawmill waste product they make the logs
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
into Lumber they chip the slabs they
 
02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
they are part participating it DCI a man
 
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
a lumber or excuse me a furniture
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer up in the Littleton area
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then the third is is Middleton
 
02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
building supplier depro Pine sales over
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
in Middleton um which is out near Alton
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
they have a biomass boiler I think they
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
also put in some solar as well to kind
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
of uh augment their their power supply
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
and so to that end I'll I'm not going to
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
repeat what you've heard the last three
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
speakers did an awesome job at kind of
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
encapsula in the whole point of this the
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
self-balancing ACT I was there
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
participating in the when the the RPS
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
was developed and and Mr Evans Brown did
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
a great job at articulating it but
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
affordability and reliability we are not
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
immune well we are not ignorant of that
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
or not looking at that as as small
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
businesses but when we look at
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
reliability we also look at the need for
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
energy diversity to put all our eggs in
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
a particular basket whether it's natural
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
gas wind whatever you're not going to
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
have the reliability and that's where we
 
02:31:00.670 --> 02:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
get the crazy energy swings that we've
 
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
seen over the last couple years when
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are shortages of one Supply or the
 
02:31:08.429 --> 02:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
other the whole one of the key points of
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
the RPS and the whole mechanism behind
 
02:31:14.990 --> 02:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
it was to to promote energy diversity in
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state and local homegrown power and
 
02:31:21.309 --> 02:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
so with that that I'll just say when
 
02:31:23.269 --> 02:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
when you look at affordability and
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
reliability there is an intersection
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
there but with reliability one of the
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
key elements of that is having fuel
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
diversity with that I'll conclude my
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and I appreciate your time
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much I have a
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
quick question for you yes I know you've
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
been around this business a long time
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
watching people burn wood for to at
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
heat can you give us a some kind of a an
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
idea of why we need an incentive to get
 
02:32:01.630 --> 02:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
people to use wood boilers in their
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
businesses and their uh larg
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
institutional buildings if it's a good
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
energy source and it's a good renewable
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
energy source why do we need to provide
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
incentives to people to adopt it well in
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
and as you heard in some of the other
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
examples given before particularly on
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
the community side you you know these
 
02:32:29.150 --> 02:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
programs help bring that Capital cost
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
down they help bring that c that initial
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
Capital cost down so that it's that it's
 
02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
more competitive in in on a More Level
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
Playing Field with some of the other
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
energy sources so we see these programs
 
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
as kind of taking that initial sting
 
02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
particularly out of that initial Capital
 
02:32:50.269 --> 02:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
cost um we look at project like the
 
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County nursing home that has
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
a a biomass boiler and how those
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
programs you know for for the citizens
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
of Rockingham County or a school to
 
02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
float a bond it's a pretty and I've been
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
on a school board and suffered through
 
02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
those meetings when you're asking for a
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
bond for whatever to have something like
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
this that can tip the scale and and
 
02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
really help push a project move a
 
02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
project forward particularly if you're
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
changing a fuel source if you'd always
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
been burning oil or natural gas this is
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
kind of a new thing for some folks
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
although I will admit burning Wood's
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
been around as long as there's been
 
02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
people but it is a new thing and so this
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
helps kind of tip that scale and so to
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think it's it's a
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
competitive thing but I think it's also
 
02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
it helps with the financing particularly
 
02:33:43.389 --> 02:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
with that Capital cost right up
 
02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
front so my followup would be are you
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
saying that the capital cost for wood
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
Oilers is higher than the capital cost
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
for like an oil or a gas fired oh boy
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're testing my my knowledge
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'd have to take a look at that I know
 
02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:00.349 align:start position:0%
I'd have to take a look at that I know
the

02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I'd have to I'd have to
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
dive into the and i' I'd defer to Mr
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
nebling who's a wood boiler I'll call
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
him Guru um I defer to him in terms of
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
comparing Capital cost for for wood
 
02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
versus uh other sources of energy okay
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to Mr fr ring and Mr Mr Fring
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
too of course other questions for U Mr
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
stock seeing none I'll thank you Jason
 
02:34:33.309 --> 02:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
for being here and call next on
 
02:34:36.510 --> 02:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
Jared mullner I believe I pronounced
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
that correctly he's either representing
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
himself or representing something called
 
02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
himself or representing something called
IM

02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
IM
 
02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:45.640 align:start position:0%
Sy main sis he is from Auburn Maine
 
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
misus yes thank you chairman and the
 
02:34:49.950 --> 02:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
committee I wanted to talk a little bit
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
about America's first heating fuel wood
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh and how it has changed we have been
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
heating for it since heating with wood
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
forever um and it has changed its shape
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
and size a little bit as it's been
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
refined throughout the last 100 years a
 
02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
few hundred years that we've been using
 
02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
it and into the forms of chips and
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
pellets um and when you do refine that
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
to utilize it for heating uh the
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
equipment cost that are going to be burn
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
that uh does have a higher Capital
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
outlay than a traditional fuel um the
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
company that I work for there represents
 
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in New Hampshire
 
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
that have trucks driving to their homes
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
just like Oil Trucks but happen to
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
contain wood pellets they have hoses
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
that latches on the outside of your
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
house and will blow pellets into these
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
pellet storage bins or your new oil tank
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then convey the the pellets to a
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
heating system to heat your entire home
 
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
with wood pellet fuel or wood chip fuel
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so the refinement of America's first
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
fuel of wood has happened and is here
 
02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
and these um rebates help offset the
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
capital cost so that there are lots of
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire that have taken
 
02:36:11.389 --> 02:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of that would like to and it's
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
sort of that seesaw instability of the
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
funding of if it's there that you know
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
has prevented and been a problem uh for
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
people to make the switch and um I would
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
just like to make sure that there is
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
stability so that they're known that
 
02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
there is money available and there's not
 
02:36:33.309 --> 02:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
any stoppages of the program uh in the
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
future for all these customers that
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
would like to burn America's first fuel
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
first heating fuel thank
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative partiall has
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
one thank you chair and thank you for
 
02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
being here today um you mentioned that
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
um our new technology is higher Capital
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
Clause could you also maybe address I
 
02:37:02.269 --> 02:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's true or not they have
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
over the uh period of time they have
 
02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
higher recovery cost on what
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
they're yeah that is the reason why we
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're having people that want to do the
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
fuel switching uh higher capital outlay
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
for a more stable lower cost fuel in the
 
02:37:20.670 --> 02:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
long run so so I would argue the person
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
who talked about his high efficiency gas
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
boiler earlier that testified in the
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
long run he'll probably pay a lot
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
significant more with the fuel that he's
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
chosen to replace and use in his home
 
02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee has a
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:37:39.950 --> 02:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
for being with us today so if this bill
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
passed um and the renewable energy fund
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
ceased to exist how would that impact
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
businesses like yours that are looking
 
02:37:53.710 --> 02:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
to assist people with this transition th
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
those that want to participate in it
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um you know it's they're
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
still outlaying quite a bit of cash and
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
and deeming it worthy to do so because
 
02:38:07.269 --> 02:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
the rebates are probably only about a
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
third but it would it would drastically
 
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the people that would want to do
 
02:38:18.910 --> 02:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
it followup and you also mentioned the a
 
02:38:22.349 --> 02:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
prior um testimony talking about a high
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency burner that was on a fossil
 
02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
fuel and you said he's probably going to
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
end up paying more in the long R could
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
you say a little bit about the fact
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh say a little bit about the economics
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
of people that we're trying to help with
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
public private Investments here uh in
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the long run yeah of course
 
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
well that's why you've seen places like
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
the Dublin School uh you know uh White
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
Mountain School you've seen these
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
municip IP alties switch because it is a
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
lowcost stable fuel that they can kind
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
of pencil in what it's going to cost for
 
02:38:59.309 --> 02:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
a while there without the DraStic
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that there would be in
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels um I think speaks to the
 
02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
locality of it I mean we're not in Texas
 
02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have oil indigenous to New
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we do have trees that are
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
here and uh that should be and could be
 
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:19.550 align:start position:0%
here and uh that should be and could be
utilized

02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
um more than they already are in order
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
to help heat the homes and keep the cost
 
02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
down and keep the local money here in
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
the economy as what would happen if we
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
used what we have here for resources in
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
heat well thank you m Mr Muller I'm
 
02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
going to call on thank you for your
 
02:39:40.910 --> 02:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm going to call on Meredith
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hatfield from the nature Conservatory
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
Conservatory H long morning uh welcome m
 
02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.670 align:start position:0%
Conservatory H long morning uh welcome m
thank

02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning and I would remind
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
you you have the same time limit as
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
everyone else yes thank you very much
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
I'm Meredith Hatfield for The Nature
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
Conservancy um we uh also oppose this
 
02:40:07.269 --> 02:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
bill and we agree with many of the
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
points that have already been made so I
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
will try not to be repetitive um you've
 
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
heard about the types of Technologies
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
the types of projects that the fund has
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
supported these projects aren't just
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
good for the OWN owners and the
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
residents of the host municipalities but
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
they can also help to reduce our need
 
02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
for energy from the regional electric
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
grid which is particularly helpful in
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
times like this when um costs are so
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
high and so
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
volatile um and that helps make us less
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
dependent on um other energy sources
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
from around the region um I wanted to
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
call two things to your attention that
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
have been referenced um the annual
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
report um from November 1st of last year
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy I believe
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
was submitted to the committee but it's
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
also available on the doe uh website I
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
provide the link um to that in our
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
letter and also um uh Mr Evans Brown
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
referred to um the renewable energy fund
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds report these are
 
02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
provided from agencies to the Department
 
02:41:09.630 --> 02:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services they're also
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
available online and what I'll do is um
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'll include that with my testimony when
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
I upload it uh later today and um I
 
02:41:21.309 --> 02:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
agree we agree with um Mr nebling that a
 
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
question that you really should be
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
considering is why the fund had a
 
02:41:28.269 --> 02:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
balance of over $20 million last June
 
02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
30th um especially when in its report uh
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
the doe talks about all the
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
successes and says demand for rebates
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
and Grant Awards continues to be strong
 
02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
um so we think it would be more
 
02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to spend the funds for their
 
02:41:46.750 --> 02:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
intended purpose as Miss koll said it is
 
02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund of rate payer money
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
that should be used for its intended
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
purpose um the other point is that
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
rather than undermining the RPS and the
 
02:41:58.150 --> 02:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
purposes of the renewable energy fund
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
and failing to invest in Innovation and
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
energy Independence it actually would be
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
more consistent with some of the other
 
02:42:07.389 --> 02:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
policy bills that you're considering
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
this year looking at how to ensure that
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is innovative um to it
 
02:42:14.429 --> 02:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
would actually be more consistent to
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
maintain this funding and continue to
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
make it available uh to New Hampshire
 
02:42:21.309 --> 02:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
customers including businesses residents
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
institutions and towns um we would
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
request that you either find this bill
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate or if you
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
would like to explore these issues to
 
02:42:33.309 --> 02:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to become a study
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
committee to consider them further thank
 
02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for Miss
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
Hatfield representative
 
02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:42:45.790 --> 02:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
Miss Hatfield for coming in uh one of
 
02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
the initiatives that would be struck
 
02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
down by uh the bill would be the office
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind initiatives I'm not
 
02:42:55.469 --> 02:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
sure if that's the exact right title but
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh can you comment
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
on what that would do to our energy uh
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
diversity and our you know overall the
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
overall meeting our overall energy needs
 
02:43:07.870 --> 02:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
in coming decades if if that office
 
02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't there that's off topic of the
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
subject of the bill it's in the bill
 
02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's the the lines that are struck
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
from the bill are include the office of
 
02:43:18.429 --> 02:43:18.439 align:start position:0%
offshore wind somebody else mentioned it
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay my mistake I'll allow it um thank
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan you know fuel
 
02:43:24.990 --> 02:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
diversity is an important aspect of the
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
both the RPS and
 
02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
thef um you know prior speakers did
 
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
refer to the recent executive order at
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
the federal level uh pausing offshore
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
wind um so we may not see much
 
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
investment in that area but continuing
 
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
to have an office of innovation At Doe I
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
think really makes sense and it could
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
support uh the committee's continued
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
investigation into modular nuclear and
 
02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
you know other Technologies as they
 
02:43:53.479 --> 02:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
you know other Technologies as they
become

02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
available additional questions seeing
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
none thank you and um final word goes to
 
02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation good morning again um thanks
 
02:44:19.230 --> 02:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
for having me up here a second time my
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
name is Nick cof with the conservation
 
02:44:21.790 --> 02:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
law Foundation I'm a senior attorney
 
02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
there I'm here to testify an opposition
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
to HP 224 um this bill would essentially
 
02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate the renewable energy fund but
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
rebating these funds to rate payers
 
02:44:34.269 --> 02:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
would only result in Trivial benefits to
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
them um as has been mentioned each year
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
the department of energy comes out with
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
a renewable energy fund annual report
 
02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
great read uh recommend anybody reading
 
02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
it that hasn't already um but the report
 
02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
provides some information on the total
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
costs of alternative compliance payments
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
which you know we've heard fund the the
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
fund um now based on the information in
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
the report if the entire renewable
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
energy fund had been rebated to Electric
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
rays in
 
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
2023 the average residential customer
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
would have received a rebate of only 34
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
cents per month in 2023 so the
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
calculations are explained in my written
 
02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
testimony which been um handed around
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
but it's based on table four in the um
 
02:45:17.469 --> 02:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
report so 34 cents that's what we're
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
talking about here really per month
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so in other words rebating the
 
02:45:23.550 --> 02:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is going to result
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
in negligible benefits for rap payers
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
but now now I want to shift my attention
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit to the benefits of the fund
 
02:45:31.950 --> 02:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
um you as it's already mentioned the
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
report says that the the fund boosts the
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
state economy creates jobs for
 
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
electricians plumbers um energy
 
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
businesses but you know it's also
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
benefited schools and towns um providing
 
02:45:46.710 --> 02:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
them rebates and grants and in 2024 a
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
grant was awarded to Raymond High School
 
02:45:51.870 --> 02:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
to fund a biomass heating system and so
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate the fund towns and
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
schools and the people in those towns
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
the kids that go to those schools you
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
know they're they're going to be hurt
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to have um
 
02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
this money available to fund you know
 
02:46:06.269 --> 02:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
these much-needed Energy Systems um as
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
also is detailed in the report the the
 
02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
fund funds um low-income projects for
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
for low-income customers um so customers
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
live in manufactured housing or that
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
live in multif family rental housing
 
02:46:22.269 --> 02:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
just by for an example in 2024 the fund
 
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
um helped finance a project undertaken
 
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire Catholic Charities um
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that will benefit 59 households and
 
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
results in each household receiving $300
 
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
a year in benefits so in conclusion um
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the fund is going to
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
result in close to nothing in benefits
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
for the average residential rapair or
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
any Rays for that matter but it will
 
02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
harm those towns and um and schools that
 
02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
rely on it to help to help fund the
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
energy systems they need to do um as
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
well as the contractors and businesses
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
that uh that do that work um and the
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
low-income folks too that that benefit
 
02:46:57.070 --> 02:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
from those programs um thank you very
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
much happy to answer any of your
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative MC
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Koff
 
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
for being here um what struck me as you
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
were speaking is that uh one of the
 
02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
things we're not really discussing is
 
02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
rebating the money that's in the program
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
and basically extinguishing the program
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh rather than keeping it in its
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
intended uh
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
state is a one-time thing right it's a
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
one-time very small negligible amount of
 
02:47:29.389 --> 02:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
money to people whereas the Investments
 
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
continue beyond just getting people over
 
02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
the hump of being able to put those in
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
right the the Investments end up
 
02:47:37.710 --> 02:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
lowering costs for towns and Facilities
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
that are making these investments into
 
02:47:42.429 --> 02:47:42.439 align:start position:0%
into the future correct well yeah so
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's a so MoneyWise there's a if
 
02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking at cost benefit I guess
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
the that's the question is that these
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
Investments ments are not just this
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
money is not just giving us um the
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
ability to get over the hump of making
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
the initial investment it is also
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
allowing people to lower their costs
 
02:48:02.030 --> 02:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
into the future yeah I mean absolutely I
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
mean if you look at the Raymond High
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
School example you know that that boiler
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
system that they've installed or
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
installing you know that's going to
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
benefit them for decades and decades and
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know going to be a lot of benefits
 
02:48:13.710 --> 02:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
for that for that school
 
02:48:16.349 --> 02:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
district okay seeing no more questions I
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your testimony and
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 224 FN and I'm going to ask
 
02:48:26.190 --> 02:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
everyone to exit the room as quickly as
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
possible we have a republican caucus
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%

the committee about how we should
 
04:06:31.469 --> 04:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
proceed because there is no one here to
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
introduce this
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%

04:06:38.920 --> 04:06:39.790 align:start position:0%
the first option is we could open the
public

04:06:39.790 --> 04:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and then close the public
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
gearing here
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
to take a 1- hour recess and come back
 
04:06:53.600 --> 04:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
to take a 1- hour recess and come back
at

04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
2:00 I could open the um public hearing
 
04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
and recess it
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
until a later
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
time anybody have any ideas rep Vice
 
04:07:11.149 --> 04:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas Mr chairman uh it it's
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
obviously that this U bill was uh
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
scheduled properly and it is in the
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
calendar for a 1:00 start and uh
 
04:07:26.149 --> 04:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
President says that we can appoint uh
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
there being no Prime sponsor or
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor here present uh we can
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
appoint a member from the committee to
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
in us the bill and then see if there are
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
any pink sheets if there are none uh my
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation will be uh public hearing
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
should be closed
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
representative nter thank you Mr chair I
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the vice chairman also this
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
came up in another committee I believe
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
it was criminal justice there was a bill
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
that uh the prime sponsor didn't show up
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
and he had no co-sponsors I don't know
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
hearing how many people would actually
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
like to discuss the substance of the
 
04:08:10.269 --> 04:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sure everybody's read it um
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody feel compelled to dis
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
discuss it looks like we have one person
 
04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to discuss it I
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can have a discussion
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
a did you intend sir to submit a pink
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
bill no one here unfortunately we have
 
04:08:41.389 --> 04:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
no one here who knows anything about it
 
04:08:41.399 --> 04:08:45.429 align:start position:0%
no one here who knows anything about it
so

04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
we do and and part of the reason I'm
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
wrestling with this is because we have a
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
rule in the house that says every bill
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
must have a public
 
04:08:57.790 --> 04:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
hearing so I would like to have a public
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
hearing but if there's nobody here to
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the bill how can you have a
 
04:09:05.229 --> 04:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
public hearing representative plog uh
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh it has been mentioned
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
one option was one of us could introduce
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
the bill and if we have someone here
 
04:09:15.790 --> 04:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
wants to hear or speak on it and then
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
from there on we can treat it as a
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
regular Bill and I'm willing to um
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill let me read it over
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair all right representative
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
um if you are brave enough to introduce
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
this bill are you also brave enough to
 
04:09:38.790 --> 04:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
it go ahead thank you um yes I I have I
 
04:09:48.189 --> 04:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
have had input on this from last session
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
if you could remember of contrails I
 
04:09:53.429 --> 04:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
pronounced that right and things like
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
that and uh people had brought things to
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
my attention which I will bring
 
04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
forth all right I guess we have uh
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
something with which we can go forward
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
so let's go ahead and open the public
 
04:10:09.630 --> 04:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
hearing then on House Bill
 
04:10:12.510 --> 04:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
436 establishing a commission to solicit
 
04:10:14.590 --> 04:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
reports and test Tony regarding
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
unidentified anomalous phenomena in the
 
04:10:22.109 --> 04:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
state and I'll call on representative PL
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill and if anybody
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
would like to speak on the bill please
 
04:10:31.510 --> 04:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
fill out and submit a pink card on the
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
best thank you question to the chair
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
before I start um in
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
so when I do this I won't be asking or
 
04:10:50.349 --> 04:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
interacting with anyone once I go back
 
04:10:50.359 --> 04:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
interacting with anyone once I go back
for

04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions no because you're you're not
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
the um the prime sponsor I think that
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
I'll wave that rule for for you for this
 
04:11:03.790 --> 04:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh for this hearing if anybody shows up
 
04:11:08.189 --> 04:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
okay so go ahead thank you um I'm
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
436 U since there is no sponsors
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
available I'm just going to skip over
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming we all has read this to the
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
duties and this is why I'm up here
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
speaking right now to the duties of the
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to seek out people who
 
04:11:32.070 --> 04:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
witnessed phenomena on that they can't
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
explain aerial
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
phenomena I had interactions with people
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
who claim I had shared where long ago I
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a question sighting that um with
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
physics I cannot
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
explain that was many in the 1970s I
 
04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the details anymore other
 
04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
than I have witnessed something now we
 
04:11:56.159 --> 04:11:57.229 align:start position:0%
than I have witnessed something now we
have

04:11:57.229 --> 04:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
citizens be it one or a
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
thousand who have come before us with
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
things in the sky we had no uh New
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
Jersey of late of mystery drones flying
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
around and is no one right now who can
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
take testimony or
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
evidence whatever it may be so this
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
seems to set up a three
 
04:12:24.520 --> 04:12:26.510 align:start position:0%
seems to set up a three
member

04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
commission that will
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
meet I believe uh what is it four times
 
04:12:33.040 --> 04:12:34.670 align:start position:0%
meet I believe uh what is it four times
a

04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:12:34.680 --> 04:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
a
year

04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
um I think four or three times a year to
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
take in informations and discuss what
 
04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:48.109 align:start position:0%
take in informations and discuss what
they

04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
received I'm going forward with
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
introducing this because of I do have
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
interactions of mostly the contrails and
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
other phenomena like that which when it
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention to go online
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
where they have flight
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
trackers and there are planes flying
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire that are not showing
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
up on flight tractors
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and at the same time
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
reporting of um cond condensation Trails
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
so what are they we don't know because
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's no committee at this point to
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
look at it I I think that's my whole
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding I have not spoken with any
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors so with
 
04:13:40.349 --> 04:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions good luck with that so the
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
first question I would have is
 
04:13:50.109 --> 04:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
is chapter
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
12-q a new chapter because I'm looking
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
at on the
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
U on the state well I did a Google
 
04:14:00.429 --> 04:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
search on New New Hampshire RSA chapter
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
12 and I don't see a chapter Q I see
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
12 new chapter
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
so this is a new chapter well wouldn't a
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
new chapter need to Define what
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
anomalous phenomena are and this bill
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that this is not really a
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
question I'm just thinking out loud and
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
and at this point I don't see any point
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
in US asking questions since we don't
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
have anyone really who can answer them
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
so let's just have a quick discussion I
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
mean if we recess this public hearing
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're just going to sit around and
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.469 --> 04:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
so I haven't received a pink card so I
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
have nobody else who wants to speak on
 
04:14:52.990 --> 04:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
this bill at this
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
point so let's just have a discussion
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
Vice chair
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas well I was going to com thank you
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I was going to comment on on
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
your on your last comment that uh we
 
04:15:06.670 --> 04:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
would just sit here and twit our thumbs
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
I was going to make a recommendation
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
that if we have some spare time we could
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
use that time to discuss a potential
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
list of um field trips that we that we
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
could be planning for in the spring uh
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
so that we could at least get working on
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh getting with the lobbyist and and and
 
04:15:27.870 --> 04:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
getting things organized to start on
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
that so if we if we if we do have the
 
04:15:33.109 --> 04:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
time we could employ our time in that
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
manner would be my suggestion point of
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
order who has a point of order I do uh
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
introduction uh that does not concern
 
04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um so if I'm done testim
 
04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
testifying oops yes you you can you can
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
go back to your
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
seat oh representative na ner has a
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
question what happened to the term UFO
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
unidentified flying object why did they
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
change it to unidentified anomalous
 
04:16:06.109 --> 04:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
phenomena that has been changed I
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
believe with the military so they could
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
report it in their vernacular that if I
 
04:16:15.630 --> 04:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
correct they are the ones who actually
 
04:16:15.640 --> 04:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
correct they are the ones who actually
changed

04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
that and now it's become follow
 
04:16:25.469 --> 04:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
up there's no Emoji for uh a UAP there's
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
only an emoji for
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
UFO it's not a question they must be
 
04:16:29.680 --> 04:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
UFO it's not a question they must be
behind

04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
times sir
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
we representative
 
04:16:41.149 --> 04:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I believe the predominant
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
reason for going with anomalous
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
phenomenon rather than unidentified
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
flying objects is some of these quote
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
unquote sightings are uh entities that
 
04:17:01.389 --> 04:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
Swanson um excuse me a while back the
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
Air Force Air Force had a uh UFO hot
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
line uh it was changed recently to
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
unidentified anomolous object and it
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
would seem like uh this something like
 
04:17:22.950 --> 04:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
this would be redundant to that at least
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
air okay who's next uh representative
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
Harrington I just uh just because
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
someone comes up with an idea doesn't
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
mean we should even be considering it as
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
a bill I mean what does this got to do
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the function of the state New
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our authority to go after
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
UFOs I mean I I just think this is a
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
total waste of time and
 
04:17:54.109 --> 04:17:54.119 align:start position:0%
effort representative Wendy Thomas um
 
04:17:55.710 --> 04:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
I I think this question was was answered
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
by uh a previous uh representative
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
comment but you when you introduced the
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
bill you were talking about aerial
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
phenomena and yet in in line seven it
 
04:18:11.149 --> 04:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
talks about the skies and territories
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
and I think I just heard that this also
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
includes water and is
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
there so it's very Broad in its in its
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
correct I would I would
 
04:18:32.670 --> 04:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
Define your question as being correct
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
not writing this bill I also have
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions I am introducing it
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
because citizens have asked these
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions in front of us before
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it should have been brought
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
up and that's why I'm bringing up that
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
there are constituents out there for
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
concerns uh representative Vice chair
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
question for the chairman I because of a
 
04:19:05.109 --> 04:19:05.119 align:start position:0%
previous comment are we in a question
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
mode to the introductory person or are
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
we in a discussion mode where we can
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
bring up General discussions um and
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
should we release the spe the uh the uh
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
the kind representative to go back to a
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
seat I did try to release him a little
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
while ago but so you you are released
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
chair but let's continue our discussion
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative parial thank you chair I
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
want many un record I'm this is the
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
first I'm the first person to agree from
 
04:19:37.109 --> 04:19:37.119 align:start position:0%
our side with a representative
 
04:19:38.830 --> 04:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
Herrington this
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
year um but I do want to ask um I'm not
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is more of a question for the
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
entire committee I've never seen a bill
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
that has three members of the house and
 
04:19:50.830 --> 04:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
no members of the
 
04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
Senate yeah and a commission doesn't
 
04:19:55.590 --> 04:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't list any other members this
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
is unusual for me it is very unusual and
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
and also it's a commission rather than a
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
study committee commissions usually have
 
04:20:04.359 --> 04:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
study committee commissions usually have
outside

04:20:07.590 --> 04:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
members yeah commissions are permanent
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
unless they have a an explicit end date
 
04:20:15.870 --> 04:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
which this one does not can have members
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
outside the house right commissions can
 
04:20:22.750 --> 04:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
house representative Corman um so given
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
that we have no more witnesses is are we
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
still in a public hearing or is or
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
closed that's a good question maybe um
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll call the clerk and ask him if
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
we can have a discussion about a bill if
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to testify actually I
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question and the
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
followup would be um I know in uh the
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
last session if the chair and ranking
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
member agreed to exec a bill uh at any
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
time then the bill could be exact and
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is that still the rule and
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh would the chair and ranking member be
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
interested in executing this bill
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
now I can ask the clerk about that that
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
is the rule however you have to put in
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
the calendar when you have a public
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
hearing the disclaimer that a public
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
hearing may happen at any time and and
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't do that executive session
 
04:21:27.630 --> 04:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
rather yeah and we didn't do that so I'm
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
not sure we could do that today but I'll
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk and
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
um so let's just uh hang on for a minute
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.550 --> 04:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
they're getting they're getting a ride
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
alien I've sent a text to the house
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay I just got a response from the
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
clerk he says someone should introduce
 
04:23:30.109 --> 04:23:30.119 align:start position:0%
the bill formally well we've done that
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you want to discuss it you should go
 
04:23:32.399 --> 04:23:34.510 align:start position:0%
if you want to discuss it you should go
into

04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
exec all right so now let me say we did
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.469 --> 04:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
oh Yeti there yeah Yeti I can spell that
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:24:26.040 --> 04:24:41.309 align:start position:0%
they have
one

04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Corman
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the um answer to your question is no
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
that part of the rule was repealed
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
clerk so we can't just do it unless we
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
notice it ahead of time so I will try to
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
include that notice in all future public
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
hearing notices of the committee so that
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
we can do that if it h if this happens
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
again so CL he did not answer my
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
question about whether oh yes he did if
 
04:26:04.269 --> 04:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
we want to discuss it we have to go EXA
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
we have to go into an exact but we can't
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
go into exec so I guess we're done done
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh I'm open to suggestions if
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%

impressive it's a short walk and it's
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing what they're doing there
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
and at the same time they have pack
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
badok not far away that's been
 
04:28:24.269 --> 04:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
recommended by one of the people that
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
testified here is a communication Tower
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%

it's it's it's been a while uh but we
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
could also do a trip to the uh natural
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
gas power plant in lary run formerly run
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
by Calpine I believe they're recently
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
being sold um and while we're there we
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
could take a a very short side trip to
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
to another weather uh indicator station
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's also located in lunder as well so
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
we could kill two birds Mr chairman Mr
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
chairman yes uh representative McGee um
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
several of us as part of clean energy
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
week went over to um the facility oh not
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
my mind is going blank but um Granite
 
04:29:38.349 --> 04:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
Shore power has a facility over on the
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast where they're putting in
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
batteries as well as doing the same uh
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
in Shilling yeah I couldn't Schiller
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't think of it um so I would I
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see if we could get a tour
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
of Schiller station because they had
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
some really interesting things going on
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
there and they had some really uh
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
qualified people to answer questions for
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
those of you that were there you
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
probably remember uh about what they're
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do so I would I would put that
 
04:30:05.710 --> 04:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
one on the
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
list Granite sh power Granite Shore
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
power representative Corman
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
yeah um so this would not be something
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
for the whole committee but actually
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
something that I'm going to be doing
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
during the break that we have at the end
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
of February is that representative Manos
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
and I are going to Weirton West Virginia
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
to the form energy battery Factory
 
04:30:28.349 --> 04:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
that's the company that makes the iron
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
air batteries that are going to be the
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
basis of the 8.5 gwatt hour facility in
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
Maine and I'd asked um uh Sarah Jackson
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
when when we saw her a few months ago if
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
I could get a tour and we're going to go
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
get a tour uh I'd be pleased to report
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
back please take lots of pictures so we
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
can I asked about that and they said uh
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
they might be able to provide me some
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
photos but they might not be keen on me
 
04:30:52.439 --> 04:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
photos but they might not be keen on me
taking

04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
taking
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
all another possibility is the
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
eversource control room it's um an an
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
impressive uh facility not quite on the
 
04:31:13.550 --> 04:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
order of Iona England but nevertheless
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh impressive and it's very local it
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's in Manchester so it's not a long
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
trip and it
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
controls the sector that we care most
 
04:31:26.109 --> 04:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
about which is the state of New
 
04:31:28.590 --> 04:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right so you'll get a chance
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
to talk to engineers and get much more
 
04:31:34.269 --> 04:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
personal you'll get more personal
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
attention there than you will at ISO New
 
04:31:38.229 --> 04:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
England in terms of being in the pit and
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
talking to people that actually operate
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um I have had the great
 
04:31:54.109 --> 04:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um go to Mount Washington
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
twice now um and they've put up um at
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
least I think there seven to nine new
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
weather stations on the east side of the
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
the mountain and they're doing a great
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
job monitoring weather and and
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
predicting and and that could be a good
 
04:32:14.109 --> 04:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
suggestions I think that's a pretty
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
substantial list that you have there
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
so we should be free to start doing some
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
trips maybe in
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
May and we wouldn't do anything after
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
no noile you get no mileage after June
 
04:32:46.000 --> 04:32:49.710 align:start position:0%
no noile you get no mileage after June
30th

04:32:49.710 --> 04:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.030 --> 04:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
so all right is there anything else the
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee would like to discuss between
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
now and two
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay you're free to go just be
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.760 --> 04:33:40.709 align:start position:0%

my pleasure to introduce House Bill 627
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple bill it expands the
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
providers of a federal government
 
05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
program that's been around since the
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
late 1980s called Lifeline
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.320 --> 05:01:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
of

05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
advantages mostly for lowincome
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
people it's an affordable
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
an better way to contact a health care
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
provider for example it would support
 
05:01:49.708 --> 05:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
tele medicine which will help people
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
stay out of emergency rooms when they
 
05:01:54.750 --> 05:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
need Primary
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
Care it provides better access to remote
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
learning opport opportunities through
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
the internet internet hotspots
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
Etc it provides better access to
 
05:02:11.788 --> 05:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
emergency First Responders 911 services
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it also provides affordable access
 
05:02:16.110 --> 05:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
to broadband and Wireless
 
05:02:18.430 --> 05:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
Communications that can help people find
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
a job keep a
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
job deal with what's increasingly a
 
05:02:24.280 --> 05:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
job deal with what's increasingly a
complex

05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
economy so this is a bill that expands
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for lower
 
05:02:34.590 --> 05:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
income New Hampshire
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
citizens and it doesn't cost us anything
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
no State money is recovered not required
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
to support this
 
05:02:46.830 --> 05:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill this bill the Lifeline Services and
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
and the other services that are provided
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
by this bill are actually funded by
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
federal Universal service fund fees USF
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
fees which if you look closely is on
 
05:03:00.190 --> 05:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
your monthly cell phone
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
bill so we all fund this
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
program through our cell phone bills no
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
additional monies will be NE necess NE
 
05:03:13.230 --> 05:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
AR and having more lifeline providers in
 
05:03:14.910 --> 05:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will enable more New
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens to have affordable
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
access to a variety of
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
services the bill itself is is based on
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that was recently passed in
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine it uses the
 
05:03:32.910 --> 05:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
essentially the same language just
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
modified for New Hampshire and it allows
 
05:03:38.350 --> 05:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
the public service utility uh commission
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.390 --> 05:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
designate mobile commercial commercial
 
05:03:47.788 --> 05:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
mobile service providers or Tel
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
Communications companies to be a carrier
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of receiving Universal
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
service support so it's a fairly simple
 
05:04:00.110 --> 05:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
Bill and passage of this legislation
 
05:04:01.868 --> 05:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
will reclaim New Hampshire's Authority
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
05:04:06.030 --> 05:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
government to allow the feds to keep
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
Soul control to to designate which
 
05:04:08.798 --> 05:04:11.070 align:start position:0%
Soul control to to designate which
lifeline

05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
05:04:11.080 --> 05:04:13.470 align:start position:0%
lifeline
telecommu

05:04:13.470 --> 05:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
telecommu
 
05:04:16.510 --> 05:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I misread
 
05:04:19.708 --> 05:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
that so passage of this legislation
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
reclaims New Hampshire's Authority from
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
government to keep sole control over
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
design designating which Lifeline
 
05:04:32.430 --> 05:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
telecommun telecommunications companies
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
operate in our state by passing this
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill New Hampshire's POC can for the
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
first time make this
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
decision and the lower income citizens
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
in our state many who are seniors and
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
Veterans will benefit because they will
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
have affordable and better access to
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
wireless and Broadband
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
services and with that I'd be happy to
 
05:04:52.320 --> 05:04:56.628 align:start position:0%
services and with that I'd be happy to
take

05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.548 --> 05:05:07.558 align:start position:0%
Thomas didn't mean to but oh okay um
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
actually the the the ranking member had
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
a question before me should she go first
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
yeah well okay I saw one hand that's why
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
he was oh okay thank you thank you
 
05:05:20.670 --> 05:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody and thank you Mr
 
05:05:22.990 --> 05:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
chairman for your testimony so I have a
 
05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
question it sounds like we're um the
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
Bill's maybe primary purpose is to shift
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
Authority so that we're able to
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
determine who would be eligible um to be
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
yeah it says in here uh eligible that
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
they would be become an eligible
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carrier so do we have
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
any idea who would be affected because
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like maybe the major service
 
05:05:50.788 --> 05:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
carriers that we have in the state are
 
05:05:52.270 --> 05:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
already in that category and already
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
have this program so who is it for
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
basically who who does it
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
help it doesn't
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
help to use your terminology any te
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
telecommunications vendor it just gives
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
the state The Authority that the federal
 
05:06:12.430 --> 05:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
government has to determine who those
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
carriers might be so right now New
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of only five states in
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
the entire country that do not have this
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
Authority and in the last two years four
 
05:06:26.548 --> 05:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
other states Maine Florida Virginia
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and Alabama unanimously passed
 
05:06:31.708 --> 05:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
similar bills to change their laws to
 
05:06:34.590 --> 05:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
reclaim this Authority from the FCC so
 
05:06:36.150 --> 05:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
basically what we're doing here is
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
reclaiming from the FCC the authority
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
providers representative Winnie Thomas
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Vice chair um thank you
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill and uh for
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question um on line three it
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
says that the commission may designate
 
05:07:05.070 --> 05:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
any commercial mobile service provider
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
or Telecom telecommunications company
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then in line seven it says
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
designated as an eligible uh
 
05:07:15.990 --> 05:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carrier my my
 
05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
question is with that word any
 
05:07:21.310 --> 05:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
commercial mobile service provider so
 
05:07:23.708 --> 05:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
there are no qualifications or
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
standardizations for these providers
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
one not sure I understand that
 
05:07:37.868 --> 05:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
question I think what this language
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
basically means is that on lines three
 
05:07:41.200 --> 05:07:42.110 align:start position:0%
basically means is that on lines three
and

05:07:42.110 --> 05:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
four it's up to the commission to decide
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
who to
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
designate and in
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
lines six and
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
seven uh there may be already some who
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
designated by the federal government so
 
05:08:04.750 --> 05:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
this extends that designation ability to
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
the commission follow
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
up follow up thank you you um so does
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
the Pu who you say designates these
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
carriers do they have a list of criteria
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
that these carriers must meet in order
 
05:08:20.910 --> 05:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
to be designated I think that's my
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
question oh now I understand the
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
question I don't believe so um because
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
the criteria I think are designated
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
under the US statutary codes that are
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
listed on line8 in the bill
 
05:08:40.920 --> 05:08:44.390 align:start position:0%
listed on line8 in the bill
thank

05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
you represent Corman you have a question
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair thanks for
 
05:08:52.270 --> 05:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um where did the idea
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
for this come from I know you said other
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
states are doing this but um how did he
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
get get into your
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
head so last summer I was attending a
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
conference of legislators from all
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
across the country and Senator Judson
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hill from the state of Georgia
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
approached me and suggested to me that
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is one of only
 
05:09:18.150 --> 05:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
five states that do not have this
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
Authority that we
 
05:09:23.948 --> 05:09:23.958 align:start position:0%
consider uh adopting this Authority or
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
reclaiming this
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
Authority he Senator Hill has sort of
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
made it a life project of his to help
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
get Lifeline Services to the entire you
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
know all the citizens of the United
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
States he was behind the move uh to
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
adopt this program in the state of Maine
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
he even went to the state of Maine and
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
testified before their legislature he
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
volunteered to come here and testify
 
05:09:56.548 --> 05:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
before our legislature but I suggested
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
that um that probably wouldn't be
 
05:10:01.948 --> 05:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
necessary because there's nothing but
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
upside to this bill there's no downside
 
05:10:12.910 --> 05:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%

representative
VES

05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
VES
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I did represent represent
 
05:10:39.150 --> 05:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
Berard please ask your question thank
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
you youbody shair um so it's my
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that the little fee line
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
on our uh on our bill that uh pays for
 
05:10:52.350 --> 05:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
this we will'll now just be transferring
 
05:10:54.430 --> 05:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
money that the that the that was
 
05:10:56.548 --> 05:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
collected and went to the feds now comes
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
to us so there's no there's no net
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
change in any costs no no this fee is
 
05:11:06.548 --> 05:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
collected from the entire country yeah
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
so you're paying it
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
already but the Monies to fund the
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
lifeline program come from this fee it
 
05:11:19.948 --> 05:11:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you and thank you for
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in a nutshell what
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
they're doing here is we have an
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
existing program that works for landline
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
phones and has for a number of years and
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're saying now well some people don't
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a landline phone anymore so they're
 
05:11:37.868 --> 05:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
they're only using a cell phone and cell
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
phones aren't eligible and unless we
 
05:11:41.628 --> 05:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation so it's basically
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
expanding the existing landline service
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
to Encompass cell phones as well that is
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank and some of those
 
05:11:50.910 --> 05:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
same people who don't have a landline
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
phone also don't have a computer and
 
05:11:57.788 --> 05:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
internet access so all they have is a
 
05:12:00.270 --> 05:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
cell phone so that's their single point
 
05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
of contact with the what we all know to
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.400 --> 05:12:13.390 align:start position:0%
 
represent

05:12:13.390 --> 05:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
partial Thank You Cher um it sounds like
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
a splendid idea I'm curious though um
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
will this affect the carrier of Last
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
Resort in any way it sounds like it make
 
05:12:27.548 --> 05:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
may make the carrier of Last Resort more
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
affordable option through a cell phone
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure of
 
05:12:34.750 --> 05:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
that that's a separate designation from
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
being designated a
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
Lifeline support carrier so I wouldn't
 
05:12:42.030 --> 05:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
expect that it would have any effect on
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
it okay thank
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
you okay being no other questions thank
 
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
you representative OES I'll call on M
 
05:12:53.548 --> 05:12:53.558 align:start position:0%

Bill

05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
627 um but there I would like to just
 
05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
point out a couple things there is a
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
long-standing practice for the state to
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
defer to the FCC to designate
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
telecommunications providers as eligible
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
Communications telecommunications
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
carriers through that they're able to
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
receive Universal service support
 
05:13:37.708 --> 05:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
including um the federally funded
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
Lifeline program which provides a
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
discount on um on the bill there are
 
05:13:44.910 --> 05:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
currently no hurdles or obstacles for
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
providers to be approved as eligible
 
05:13:50.310 --> 05:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carriers by the FCC
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
um should this Duty change to the Pu the
 
05:13:54.190 --> 05:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
department does not believe it will
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee more carriers will offer a
 
05:13:59.628 --> 05:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
Lifeline discount to customers um and as
 
05:14:01.548 --> 05:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have a state
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
Universal service program the FCC may be
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
better suited to making this decision um
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
and the current practice of the
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
department Fields has been
 
05:14:12.750 --> 05:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
efficient that's all I have for you
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
today if there's any questions happy to
 
05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
take those okay thank you any questions
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
for Miss
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
Stone representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
05:14:23.948 --> 05:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um there's been some
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
discussion about how this would um not
 
05:14:28.430 --> 05:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
affect us financially because we're just
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
essentially transferring money from the
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
feds to New Hampshire is there any other
 
05:14:36.990 --> 05:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
application that is covered under that
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
money that might be lost if we if we do
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
this transfer specifically for this
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
program I don't believe so thank
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you for taking my
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
question um I just want to make sure I'm
 
05:14:54.990 --> 05:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
straight on this so right now there are
 
05:14:57.150 --> 05:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
no cell phone companies in New Hampshire
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
that can provide this uh Lifeline
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
Service uh that I that I am not entirely
 
05:15:05.150 --> 05:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
sure if there are no cell phone
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
companies that can provide it I if they
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
can apply through the FCC to be
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
designated as a carrier um the state is
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
just not doing that okay followup follow
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
up well so I I guess what I'm hearing
 
05:15:23.310 --> 05:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
then is that this simply says now the
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
state will have the authority to do with
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
what the FCC already has yeah and I'm
 
05:15:32.750 --> 05:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to wonder why why is that
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
advantageous um like I said we're
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
neutral on this but we do believe the
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee yeah so I
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
heard what you said I heard your
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and it sounds like what you're
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
saying is it it it's not broken in any
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
way the Department's position is that
 
05:16:04.548 --> 05:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
the process if if anybody wants to
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
participate in the lifeline program they
 
05:16:08.110 --> 05:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
can apply through the process that
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they would become members of the
 
05:16:13.470 --> 05:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
lifeline program so there's not anything
 
05:16:15.948 --> 05:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
inhibiting people doing it today that
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
would warrant us having to take it over
 
05:16:20.190 --> 05:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
in order to improve it is that an
 
05:16:22.350 --> 05:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
accurate correct yes um we have heard of
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
no uh obstacles for any any providers
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
than representative
 
05:16:33.070 --> 05:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so would this transfer result
 
05:16:37.548 --> 05:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
in an an expansion of the program in New
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we don't we don't currently
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
we just don't believe it guarantees that
 
05:16:46.110 --> 05:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
more uh providers will come online for
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
this um so I I can't I can't say if it
 
05:16:51.628 --> 05:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
if it would be expanded or
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
not okay thank
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um going back
 
05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
to your statement that there are no
 
05:17:06.250 --> 05:17:06.260 align:start position:0%
obstacles for companies to apply now can
 
05:17:06.260 --> 05:17:07.390 align:start position:0%
obstacles for companies to apply now can
[Music]

05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
you give us some perspective as to
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps why 45 other states felt a need
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
to enact legislation in order to allow
 
05:17:19.350 --> 05:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
their states to get this done at the
 
05:17:21.788 --> 05:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
state level I can't speak to uh why
 
05:17:24.548 --> 05:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
other states made the decision no but I
 
05:17:27.150 --> 05:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
can I can look into some some answers
 
05:17:27.160 --> 05:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
can I can look into some some answers
for

05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh for coming in again
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have the answer to
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
this question but I'm looking at it from
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
the other point of view which is how
 
05:17:46.350 --> 05:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
many New Hampshire citizens are
 
05:17:48.750 --> 05:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
currently covered by a program such as
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
the lifeline program under the existing
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
carriers and do you do we have any
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
estimation of the need for this kind of
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
program in terms of people who are
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
lacking access to broadband Etc um I
 
05:18:00.350 --> 05:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that currently
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
you any more questions representative
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas Doug Thomas thank you Mr chman
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take this as my follow on
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
question um just out of
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
curiosity is there a cost for carriers
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
now to apply to the FCC to get their
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
capability and if so would that cost be
 
05:18:30.350 --> 05:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
more expensive than having the state
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
handle it that I'm not entirely sure but
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions I'll thank
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you Miss stone for being here
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any more pink cards so
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
apparently we're we're done is there
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else who would like to testify on
 
05:18:56.590 --> 05:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:19:00.030 --> 05:19:00.040 align:start position:0%

so let's open a public hearing on House
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 4 60- FN relative to utility
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
investments in distributed energy
 
05:31:18.270 --> 05:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
resources and call upon the bill sponsor
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee to introduce
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
introduce this
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
colleagues on uh science technology and
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
energy uh I'm representative cat McGee
 
05:31:31.948 --> 05:31:31.958 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro 35
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hollis I come before you today in
 
05:31:38.190 --> 05:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
support of HB 460 which is a simple bill
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to further Define the
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
factors to be considered by the Public
 
05:31:44.910 --> 05:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission when being asked to
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
determine the public interest prior to
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
authorizing a UTI's recovery rate for
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
its portion of a distributed energy
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
investment as most are aware utilities
 
05:31:59.948 --> 05:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
are able to invest uh in up to 6% of
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
their low demand in distributed energy
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
generation this was done this was um
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
decided upon in order to increase clean
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
energy Supply in the state and to
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
support fuel
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
diversity the statute in question is RSA
 
05:32:19.628 --> 05:32:19.638 align:start position:0%
374 G5 to F and I've given you um a
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
print out of the section of 374 which is
 
05:32:25.830 --> 05:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
the electric restructuring statute um
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
just so you can see it in context the
 
05:32:31.868 --> 05:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
idea is that instead of uh letter F
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
simply saying the effect on comp on
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
competition within the Region's
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and the state
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
energy uh Services market so what it
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill seeks to do is rather
 
05:32:47.590 --> 05:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
than leave that as a general statement
 
05:32:50.750 --> 05:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
there to put some specificity to it so
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
when the Public Utilities Commission is
 
05:32:55.868 --> 05:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
trying to determine whether something is
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
valuable um or the value of something
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that they include the actual factors
 
05:33:05.708 --> 05:33:05.718 align:start position:0%
that contribute to that value
 
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
so um it would read under Section F the
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
effect on competition with the Region's
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and the state Energy
 
05:33:19.150 --> 05:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
Services Market including the extent to
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
which utility rates tariffs metering
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
data sharing Consolidated bills and load
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
estimation and settlement processes
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
enable customer generators and limited
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
producers under RSA 362a to be able to
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
realize credit for Value produced and
 
05:33:40.350 --> 05:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
cost avoided comparable to those
 
05:33:42.030 --> 05:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
benefits claimed in the electric
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
utilities proposal to support its
 
05:33:47.390 --> 05:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
proposed investment that sounds like a
 
05:33:49.948 --> 05:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
lot of words it's a mouthful but what it
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
does is it uh is Define the missing
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
Market factors in statute that should
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
receive consideration by the Public
 
05:34:00.750 --> 05:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission in the calculation
 
05:34:03.150 --> 05:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
of utility rate filings for
 
05:34:05.868 --> 05:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement value it serves to provide
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
a level of specificity that is needed to
 
05:34:11.230 --> 05:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
ensure the Pu standard of just and
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable for customers and make sure
 
05:34:16.110 --> 05:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
that it's not in the eye of the beholder
 
05:34:17.948 --> 05:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
but it can be justified and even
 
05:34:21.150 --> 05:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
Quantified by including Market factors
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
when they apply to determine
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates importantly this
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill incorporates the need to properly
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
value customer generators and limited
 
05:34:34.350 --> 05:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
producers for their role in avoided
 
05:34:37.150 --> 05:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
costs for the utilities and customers
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
these are contributing factors they are
 
05:34:41.830 --> 05:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
not represented in the statute today and
 
05:34:43.788 --> 05:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
they should be listed in the statute so
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for the bill my last
 
05:34:48.868 --> 05:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
point I'll I'll give you before I open
 
05:34:51.150 --> 05:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
up for questions is you may have noticed
 
05:34:52.990 --> 05:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
like many of the bills that we have this
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
year um this bill has a fiscal note um I
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
looked into why um specifying seven
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
additional Market factors in statutory
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
language would result in a fiscal note
 
05:35:07.868 --> 05:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
because it's a very short Bill and I
 
05:35:09.310 --> 05:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
called the office of legislative
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
Services they referred me to the
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislative budget office I'm sorry the
 
05:35:14.080 --> 05:35:15.310 align:start position:0%
legislative budget office I'm sorry the
uh

05:35:15.310 --> 05:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:18.750 --> 05:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
LBA um legislative budget
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
assistant um and Mr Shay told me that
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
Ben Martin McDon of the Pu had responded
 
05:35:26.310 --> 05:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of head commissioner Dan
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
goldner and that uh commissioner goldner
 
05:35:30.190 --> 05:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
had said the
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
Pu would need to open an adjudicative
 
05:35:36.510 --> 05:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding and hire staff Andor
 
05:35:39.670 --> 05:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
consultants if the bill passed into law
 
05:35:41.470 --> 05:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
um in last week's
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr spidel who's an attorney at
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission uh
 
05:35:48.270 --> 05:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that when they have questions
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
for which they no longer have staff
 
05:35:53.310 --> 05:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
expertise uh they rely on subject matter
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
experts from various stakeholders within
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
the state they have access to them all
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
they come into the Pu all the time in
 
05:36:00.990 --> 05:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
this in that case it was the New
 
05:36:02.590 --> 05:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op that had provided
 
05:36:04.990 --> 05:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
expertise when they had a question um
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
but they also have access to the
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
utilities and people from Community
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
power and all of them have sign
 
05:36:13.390 --> 05:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
significant expertise they can and would
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
be willing to informally provide to
 
05:36:17.390 --> 05:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
assist the state agencies in
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
understanding the complexity of any of
 
05:36:21.990 --> 05:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
these issues um adding this language to
 
05:36:24.510 --> 05:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
statute would not require an
 
05:36:26.708 --> 05:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding unless our puuc
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
is unfamiliar with utility rates tariffs
 
05:36:32.430 --> 05:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
metering data sharing Consolidated bills
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
load estimation and settlement and the
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
importance of price signals for Value
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
produced and costs avoided
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
these are the nuts and bolts of the work
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission is
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
employed as our regul regulatory body to
 
05:36:46.320 --> 05:36:47.110 align:start position:0%
employed as our regul regulatory body to
to

05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
undertake so if this knowledge does not
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
exist in our current Energy Regulatory
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
agency that's more a commentary on
 
05:36:56.788 --> 05:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
decisions we've made in government
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
reforms there but this expertise did
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
exist in the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:37:04.150 --> 05:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
when I first came to conquer but it that
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
should not stop us from voting
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
unanimously to Divine to to Define that
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
these factors belong in the statute in
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
order to help preserve competition in
 
05:37:15.390 --> 05:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
the electricity Market which is really
 
05:37:18.910 --> 05:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill so with that um
 
05:37:21.788 --> 05:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
and I did give you all a handout and it
 
05:37:24.270 --> 05:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's just um the section of 374 where
 
05:37:25.948 --> 05:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
inserted so I hope I hope uh my
 
05:37:31.628 --> 05:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
explanation is clear in
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
that currently there are some
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
questions um at PU hearings about what
 
05:37:42.510 --> 05:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
should be in consideration for when
 
05:37:44.830 --> 05:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
these projects are being invested in and
 
05:37:47.070 --> 05:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
if we can clarify that information as a
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
legislature for them in the statutory
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
language then it's no longer a question
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
if all of these apply or only some of
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
them apply the the fact is the list
 
05:38:00.750 --> 05:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
should be more comprehensive rather than
 
05:38:03.070 --> 05:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
less and there can always be individual
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
discussions based on the adjudicative
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding that's in front of the Public
 
05:38:08.590 --> 05:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
05:38:11.628 --> 05:38:11.638 align:start position:0%
but most of these are very standard
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
standardized um terms in terms of energy
 
05:38:17.230 --> 05:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
energy valuation the value stack if you
 
05:38:20.510 --> 05:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
will and um they are customarily being
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
used by other Public Utilities
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
commissions all over the region and all
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
over the United States so um they're not
 
05:38:31.628 --> 05:38:31.638 align:start position:0%
uh they shouldn't be presenting a real
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
stumbling block uh for our
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.430 --> 05:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative McGee
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so did I understand you to say
 
05:38:48.548 --> 05:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
that adding six
 
05:38:48.558 --> 05:38:50.590 align:start position:0%
that adding six
new

05:38:50.590 --> 05:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:38:54.628 --> 05:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
um seven I think I said six or seven
 
05:38:58.708 --> 05:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
whatever new areas for invest
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
investigation uh would not
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
increase to some degree the the work
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the public Utilities Commission
 
05:39:08.520 --> 05:39:09.750 align:start position:0%
that the public Utilities Commission
must

05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
must
 
05:39:09.760 --> 05:39:11.090 align:start position:0%
must
do

05:39:11.090 --> 05:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:39:11.100 --> 05:39:13.390 align:start position:0%
do
[Music]

05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
to to rule on the effective
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
competition uh within within these
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
Services Mar I did not discuss
 
05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
investigations because the
 
05:39:26.510 --> 05:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
investigations are not
 
05:39:29.310 --> 05:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
um the investigations are being provided
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
by the utilities right that the data
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be provided on all of these inputs
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
these would be the things that the
 
05:39:39.468 --> 05:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission would want
 
05:39:43.150 --> 05:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
to consider and could consider and we as
 
05:39:45.628 --> 05:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
a legislative body are simply taking
 
05:39:47.468 --> 05:39:47.478 align:start position:0%
those definitions and putting them into
 
05:39:51.590 --> 05:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
statute so that there is now uh a list
 
05:39:53.708 --> 05:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
of the items that have
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
value that should be considered it's not
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
telling them they have to consider them
 
05:40:01.150 --> 05:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's telling them this is the list you
 
05:40:02.590 --> 05:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
should be looking at tariffs you should
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
be looking at data sharing Consolidated
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
billing load estimation these are the
 
05:40:06.558 --> 05:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
billing load estimation these are the
components

05:40:07.990 --> 05:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
components
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
that are not currently articulated in
 
05:40:13.628 --> 05:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
the restructuring statute that should be
 
05:40:16.750 --> 05:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
considered for for the valuation going
 
05:40:18.468 --> 05:40:18.478 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
05:40:18.478 --> 05:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
back to the
utilities

05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the whole point of it is
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
to get to an accurate reimbursement to
 
05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
the utilities for the benefit of the
 
05:40:33.990 --> 05:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
projects that they're bringing on and
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are other contributors often times
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
in those right there's the people who
 
05:40:38.910 --> 05:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
are actually doing the generation that
 
05:40:41.310 --> 05:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
they're supporting so right now there
 
05:40:43.270 --> 05:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
isn't a real clear path for them to be
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
able to say how does this get parsed and
 
05:40:48.390 --> 05:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
how much does the utility get reimbursed
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
for this how much you know how much of
 
05:40:52.990 --> 05:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
this is to their benefit and how much of
 
05:40:55.948 --> 05:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
it belongs to the generation asset or
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
the or the uh you know the small
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
producers that are actually um helping
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
to put it together so these are the
 
05:41:04.510 --> 05:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
components that would have to be under
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
consideration and
 
05:41:10.030 --> 05:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
you asked about investigation I there's
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
nothing in here about investigation
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
because generally how the Public
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission works is if the
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
utilities want to be reimbursed for
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
something and they're bringing a project
 
05:41:20.750 --> 05:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
to them they will give them whatever it
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
is they're required to give them if this
 
05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
isn't in language then these items will
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
not be given to them if these items are
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
in language then I'm sure that when they
 
05:41:32.468 --> 05:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
come to find out what that reimbursement
 
05:41:34.750 --> 05:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be the rate reimbursement
 
05:41:36.750 --> 05:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to bring this information
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
to the Public Utilities Commission it
 
05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
would not be the responsibility of the
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to be an
 
05:41:43.230 --> 05:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
expert on these things or to provide
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
information so my followup would be then
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
who tries
 
05:41:55.548 --> 05:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
to determine how to realize credit for
 
05:41:58.350 --> 05:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
Value produced and cost
 
05:42:00.510 --> 05:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
avoided well if it's an adjudicative
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
proceeding and it and it would be
 
05:42:04.270 --> 05:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
because these are
 
05:42:07.310 --> 05:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
utility uh investments in in distribut
 
05:42:10.390 --> 05:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
energy so it would be a a rate case
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
where the utility is seeking to gain
 
05:42:15.548 --> 05:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so they would they
 
05:42:17.788 --> 05:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
would be the they would be making the
 
05:42:17.798 --> 05:42:19.548 align:start position:0%
would be the they would be making the
case

05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
right for what for what they're
 
05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
due but now the Public Utilities
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
Commission would be able to ask on these
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
specifics to get further information to
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that they actually uh UE those
 
05:42:35.150 --> 05:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
things so this information would use be
 
05:42:38.430 --> 05:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
used to justify the ities investment in
 
05:42:41.390 --> 05:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
a Dr resource yep and these are these
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
are known components they're just not
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
currently in the in the uh electric
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
restructuring statutory language okay
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that so that's all we're trying to
 
05:42:51.990 --> 05:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
do is add it and when I saw the fiscal
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
note like you have to hire people in
 
05:42:57.868 --> 05:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
order to read the you know it it it
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
really is just asking us to say we know
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
that these things exist and that they
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
affect the valuation utility rates
 
05:43:07.628 --> 05:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
matter tariffs matter how met ings being
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
done data all these pieces are
 
05:43:12.190 --> 05:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
components so all we're saying is this
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
language should be included there so
 
05:43:16.510 --> 05:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
that it can be uh discussed at a
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
detailed level at the Public Utilities
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
Commission representative Harrington has
 
05:43:23.948 --> 05:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
a question yeah thank you um so I'm
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get this straight it sounds
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
like what you're saying is that there's
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
no analysis required by the Pu on this
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be giving they're
 
05:43:34.190 --> 05:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to be giving a figure that
 
05:43:36.070 --> 05:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
represents utility rates another figure
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
that represents tariff another figure
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
that represents metering another figure
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
that represents data sharing so forth
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so on and they're going to be a
 
05:43:44.750 --> 05:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
whole stack of these things and they're
 
05:43:46.628 --> 05:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to say okay they all add up to
 
05:43:48.750 --> 05:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
something we don't have to analyze them
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
we just we we whatever the utility gives
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
us we're accepting and that's how we're
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to determine this process I don't
 
05:43:58.830 --> 05:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
think you you asking the the Pu to
 
05:44:02.590 --> 05:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
Simply say his you his tariffs there's a
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
number his metering data there's a
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
number and they they will just say well
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you tell us that's what we're
 
05:44:10.190 --> 05:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
accepting as fact thank you for the
 
05:44:12.590 --> 05:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
question former public utilities
 
05:44:15.868 --> 05:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh Michael Harrington um no
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's how it works I mean
 
05:44:19.628 --> 05:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
generally adjudicative proceedings have
 
05:44:22.110 --> 05:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and interveners and it's
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
not just the utilities that'll be
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
providing the information or answering
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
the questions so there'll be a number of
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
um interested parties I'm sure that
 
05:44:31.468 --> 05:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
would be available so that there
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be a lot of discussion
 
05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
about what utility rate applies or what
 
05:44:38.070 --> 05:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
tariff applies or what net me metering
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh cost applies I think those things can
 
05:44:44.670 --> 05:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
be figured out pretty easily um and also
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
I think for a long time we've been
 
05:44:49.990 --> 05:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
seeing bills and hearing that there is a
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in statutory law that allows
 
05:44:56.670 --> 05:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
for the load estimation and settlement
 
05:44:58.390 --> 05:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
process that's been kind of a sticking
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
point for a while it's right there's
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
value there um we're not um
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledging it and not properly uh
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
costing for it so I think what you do is
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
you broaden the conversation for the
 
05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
folks who are engaged on any given
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
docket at the Public Utilities
 
05:45:19.948 --> 05:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
Commission to have the conversations at
 
05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
the level that they need to for whatever
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
the particular project is if it doesn't
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
apply then it doesn't apply follow up
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
followup well I I'm still trying to get
 
05:45:31.350 --> 05:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
this straight then you're saying that
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's multiple people coming in so the
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
utility may come in and say uh we
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
consider uh you this the Tariff to be
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
this and metering to be that and
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else can come in and say no no
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
no we disagree with that we're the uh I
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't know the consumer Advocate or
 
05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody so then it's up to the Pu is's
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to analyze this this these
 
05:45:52.150 --> 05:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
numbers that are given there and I don't
 
05:45:53.070 --> 05:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
know where they're going to get the
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
staff to do that I guess they defer to
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy to do some
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
investigation on that filing and then
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
make a determination is yeah we agree
 
05:46:03.628 --> 05:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
that the metering number that was
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
provided by the utility is correct or no
 
05:46:07.468 --> 05:46:07.478 align:start position:0%
we think it's too high or too low I mean
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to accept this on
 
05:46:10.430 --> 05:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
face value especially when you talk
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
about an adjudicative process anybody
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
can challenge them and if you're
 
05:46:15.390 --> 05:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
challenging them then the puc has to
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
have some ability to go somewhere and
 
05:46:19.150 --> 05:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
say we need this independently checked
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
out by someone who doesn't have a bias
 
05:46:23.468 --> 05:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
one way or the other I agree with you I
 
05:46:25.708 --> 05:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
I was against their staff being cut when
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
their staff was cut but uh you know we
 
05:46:30.830 --> 05:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to move forward from the present
 
05:46:34.590 --> 05:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
reality um so I guess what I'm saying is
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
that the adjudicative proceeding that
 
05:46:42.390 --> 05:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed um always have
 
05:46:44.110 --> 05:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
information coming from both sides that
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
has to be analyzed um and the Staffing
 
05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
considerations are something we need to
 
05:46:52.510 --> 05:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
hear from the Public Utilities
 
05:46:54.910 --> 05:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
Commission on we're not responsible for
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
figuring out those you know we were told
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
when the department of energy was
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
created and the dep the Public Utilities
 
05:47:04.030 --> 05:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
Commission jobs all went over to doe
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they would be providing some
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
support there so I can't answer the
 
05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
question about what level of expertise
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
they have but they are the regulatory
 
05:47:15.150 --> 05:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
body that is in charge of this aspect of
 
05:47:20.190 --> 05:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
our law so um I
 
05:47:23.230 --> 05:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
think I think that the fact that there
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
may be issues with uh sufficient
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
expertise among the Public Utilities
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
Commission as as it is currently
 
05:47:32.430 --> 05:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
constituted is a separate issue from
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not this body should
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously pass this bill saying that
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
these are the things that should be
 
05:47:41.110 --> 05:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
considered when a utility is looking for
 
05:47:44.030 --> 05:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement in order to make sure that
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
the price that they are being given is
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
just and
 
05:47:52.868 --> 05:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable um as as a statute
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
requires so I I don't know how else to
 
05:47:57.750 --> 05:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
say it I just
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
think if this is confusing to people I I
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
don't know who else within our
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
government can figure out how to
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
understand these because they are the
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
people that are responsible for this so
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's so section F which is the section
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're under discussion here is part of
 
05:48:22.468 --> 05:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
section two yep and section two is all
 
05:48:22.478 --> 05:48:23.788 align:start position:0%
section two yep and section two is all
about

05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
authorizing the utilities recovery of
 
05:48:30.070 --> 05:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
Investments yes correct
 
05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:41.788 --> 05:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
authorization to recover Investments to
 
05:48:45.868 --> 05:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
investigate the effect on
 
05:48:48.430 --> 05:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
competition that's what section f is all
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
about correct
 
05:48:51.240 --> 05:48:52.990 align:start position:0%
about correct
yep

05:48:52.990 --> 05:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
case it's not
 
05:49:00.760 --> 05:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
case it's not
clear

05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
what some of these factors here rates
 
05:49:08.990 --> 05:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
tariffs metering data sharing have to do
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
with with competition in the Region's
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
electricity markets can you elaborate on
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
what those I think effects might be well
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
I think section
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
two is not just utility investment
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
recovery but utility investment recovery
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
for distributed energy resources so what
 
05:49:34.468 --> 05:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
comes into play is the competitors that
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
are providing the generation and how we
 
05:49:40.510 --> 05:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
allocate which portions of the value of
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
the project that are being done go to
 
05:49:44.948 --> 05:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
which of the participants in creating
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
the energy and making it available so
 
05:49:51.788 --> 05:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive market and uh this is
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
this section section two is only about
 
05:49:58.910 --> 05:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
the utilities ability to recover what
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
they should rightfully recover for
 
05:50:02.670 --> 05:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
investing in distributed energy in a
 
05:50:05.548 --> 05:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
particular project and so the argument
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
goes that the section that says the
 
05:50:09.628 --> 05:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
05:50:13.230 --> 05:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
competition um is the appropriate place
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
05:50:18.548 --> 05:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
including these factors uh that should
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
be considered in order to come to a a
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
correct valuation that are currently not
 
05:50:26.670 --> 05:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
in the mix and I there's probably people
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
who can articulate it better than I can
 
05:50:31.230 --> 05:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
because it's their business it's not my
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
business this is my my understanding of
 
05:50:36.910 --> 05:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
um why we're putting it where we're
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
putting it and what it will uh what it
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
will assist with because you'll note
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
that in the bolded language in the bill
 
05:50:45.390 --> 05:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
which is a very you know one paragraph
 
05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
bill um It also says uh and load
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
estimation and settlement processes um
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
enable customer generators and limited
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
producers under RSA 362a to be able to
 
05:50:59.548 --> 05:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
realize credit for Value produced and
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
costs avoided okay though it is getting
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
complicated I mean everything is getting
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
complicated but if you want to have a
 
05:51:09.548 --> 05:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
free market you have to first valuate
 
05:51:11.070 --> 05:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
the pieces
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I think that's what
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
this um that's what this bill is
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is trying to pull into
 
05:51:20.670 --> 05:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
the conversation the pieces that
 
05:51:22.990 --> 05:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
actually exist already but that may not
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
be under
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
consideration representative Kaplan has
 
05:51:27.000 --> 05:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
consideration representative Kaplan has
a

05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
you represent McGee for bringing this
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
forward and I think you've done an
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
admirable job trying to explain the
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
different the different items here U
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
because it is complicated but I I don't
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
want us to lose a view of the forest for
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
the trees I think there's a lot of trees
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
here uh and I agree that the state and
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Regulatory Commission ought to have
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth to deal with these trees
 
05:51:51.670 --> 05:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
if they're important to the to the
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
underlying statute which is intended to
 
05:52:00.030 --> 05:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
bring on more uh dist yeah I do so how
 
05:52:01.948 --> 05:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
how does this the underlying statute is
 
05:52:03.430 --> 05:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
intended to bring on more distributed
 
05:52:06.190 --> 05:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
energy correct and also at the same time
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
Preserve erve uh a competitive
 
05:52:09.990 --> 05:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that's that's the section
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so how how does this
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill bring on or a guarantee that as it
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know which is our our our under our
 
05:52:21.070 --> 05:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
overall overarching interest is to bring
 
05:52:23.230 --> 05:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
on more distributed generation correct
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
so how does this bill do that and how
 
05:52:28.230 --> 05:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
does it preserve a Marketplace yeah I
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it does I think it's
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
more aimed at um it's more aimed at
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that on the competitive
 
05:52:41.230 --> 05:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
market side that the valuation that is
 
05:52:42.990 --> 05:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
provided to these projects is
 
05:52:45.670 --> 05:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
distributed properly and understood
 
05:52:48.510 --> 05:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
properly and it's it's
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
almost uh it's an attempt
 
05:52:55.830 --> 05:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
to require more sophistication in the
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
conversation around um you know how this
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
new market is going to work together all
 
05:53:04.110 --> 05:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
right so it's going to it's going to put
 
05:53:04.120 --> 05:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
right so it's going to it's going to put
into

05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
statute uh
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh factors or
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
um components that might not fully be
 
05:53:16.670 --> 05:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
being considered but that we would like
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
them to be considered in order to
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
support the competitive market and so I
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it increases anything I
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
think the utilities are still going to
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
be um doing what they're doing in terms
 
05:53:31.390 --> 05:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
of their investments in in distributed
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
energy resources um up to that 6%
 
05:53:37.150 --> 05:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
requirement of their load you know up to
 
05:53:42.750 --> 05:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
what they can invest in um so uh I I
 
05:53:45.430 --> 05:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it increases anything you'd
 
05:53:47.510 --> 05:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
have to increase the 6% if you wanted to
 
05:53:51.070 --> 05:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
actually say they could do more um so
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't get at what the
 
05:53:55.150 --> 05:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
utilities are doing in this vein it just
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
says that under the electric utility
 
05:53:58.910 --> 05:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
investment in distributed energy
 
05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
resources section of
 
05:54:04.030 --> 05:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
Statute uh under
 
05:54:06.990 --> 05:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
authorization that uh the
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
effects on competition piece will have
 
05:54:14.830 --> 05:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
additional uh clarification in terms of
 
05:54:22.270 --> 05:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.310 --> 05:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
considered representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:54:27.548 --> 05:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative are these Common Sense
 
05:54:33.030 --> 05:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
factors currently be being considered
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
when looking at the effect on
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
competition and even if they are
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't standardizing and identifying
 
05:54:41.468 --> 05:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
these factors make things more efficient
 
05:54:46.030 --> 05:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
fair and overall a more balanced
 
05:54:48.190 --> 05:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for the question
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's that's kind of the
 
05:54:51.788 --> 05:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
nail on the head not not the first part
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the question but the second half is
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
that if you standardize around language
 
05:54:58.430 --> 05:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
of what's expected then every case would
 
05:55:01.070 --> 05:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
be uniform in terms of How It's viewed
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned before not every
 
05:55:08.468 --> 05:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
component here would be relevant in
 
05:55:10.750 --> 05:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
every case and so it would be on a
 
05:55:12.590 --> 05:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis but at least the
 
05:55:14.670 --> 05:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
parties would be able to say does it
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
relate does it not relate so there would
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
be um you know something in statute to
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
hold on to to be able to have the
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether something is
 
05:55:25.310 --> 05:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
being left out and I don't think it's
 
05:55:26.868 --> 05:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome to the Public
 
05:55:28.628 --> 05:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission either because this
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
is really as I said in my testimony it's
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of what they're doing
 
05:55:36.390 --> 05:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's the market that's different um and
 
05:55:40.310 --> 05:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
that has to be um accommodated in terms
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
of how we view the value I I know when
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's going going back a bit but when
 
05:55:49.150 --> 05:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
Lee oxam was here she used to bring in
 
05:55:50.868 --> 05:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
charts and everything about the value
 
05:55:53.910 --> 05:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
stack and she would talk about um how
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
other states view the value stack of uh
 
05:55:59.830 --> 05:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
renewable energy in terms of what it
 
05:56:02.590 --> 05:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
provides to the system it isn't steady
 
05:56:06.990 --> 05:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
state but it does provide reliability
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
um because it augments and it helps with
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
Peak and you know it does a whole bunch
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
of things so it's complicated to look at
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
all the issues and I guess what this
 
05:56:18.948 --> 05:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do is say the Public
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is is where we want
 
05:56:26.590 --> 05:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
them to look at these issues and um and
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
if they need something if they really
 
05:56:30.190 --> 05:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
need something I'm sure they're going to
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
come testify they can let us know what
 
05:56:34.230 --> 05:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
that is but the fact
 
05:56:37.070 --> 05:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
is this isn't going to go away way these
 
05:56:37.080 --> 05:56:38.270 align:start position:0%
is this isn't going to go away way these
components

05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
components
 
05:56:41.788 --> 05:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
are are there thank you yeah we didn't
 
05:56:43.468 --> 05:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
make them
 
05:56:46.910 --> 05:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
up representative Bernardi has a
 
05:56:49.708 --> 05:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
question you Mr chair
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
so I I've been looking at the the the
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
core statute here which F subsection f
 
05:56:59.948 --> 05:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
is a part of and I I look at G and H in
 
05:57:03.948 --> 05:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
particular and I say you you're asking
 
05:57:07.350 --> 05:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
there that the costs and benefits uh in
 
05:57:10.830 --> 05:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
the competitive market are to all be
 
05:57:13.868 --> 05:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
addressed so in my mind all the things
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
that you listed are embodied in g&amp; h
 
05:57:22.750 --> 05:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
already in assessing competition so I
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not understanding why we need
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
this language can you help me understand
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
why G and H don't work why they don't
 
05:57:36.468 --> 05:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
work for what you're trying to get done
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
um well I mean I think they're separate
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
and distinct I think f is about the
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
effects of on the competition and that's
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
where the items um that affect the
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
valuation here are in f um all of these
 
05:57:55.548 --> 05:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
are distinct right A through I they're
 
05:58:00.350 --> 05:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
all different aspects um of number two
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
of of how to um figure out the recovery
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
um on distributed energy resource
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
investment so I I
 
05:58:15.868 --> 05:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see g&amp; as actually being
 
05:58:17.390 --> 05:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
the same I mean they're they're talking
 
05:58:20.910 --> 05:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
about the expected value and economic
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
benefits of the investment to the
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
utilities rate payers is distinct and
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
the cost and benefits to the utilities
 
05:58:30.910 --> 05:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
customers is distinct so um the place
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
where this language goes is appropriate
 
05:58:35.708 --> 05:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
I mean was is appropriately the effect
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
on uh competition within the Region's
 
05:58:40.670 --> 05:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and the state's
 
05:58:44.150 --> 05:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
Energy Services market so it's it's
 
05:58:47.230 --> 05:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
separate in my mind so I I don't I don't
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
have any other answer for you I don't
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
see them as being overlapping I I see
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
them as different follow follow up yes
 
05:58:57.310 --> 05:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
so when when you're looking at
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
competition you've identified those
 
05:59:01.868 --> 05:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
seven factors when you're looking in g&amp;
 
05:59:06.310 --> 05:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at uh the cost and the
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
benefits to both the utility and to the
 
05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
rate payers so when you're looking at
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
the to benefits to the rate payers the
 
05:59:15.868 --> 05:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that you're identifying
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
in your seven factors are those factors
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
so if if you're doing that assessment
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
you've covered the base so are you
 
05:59:25.788 --> 05:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we take those factors
 
05:59:28.310 --> 05:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
and put that specificity in G versus F
 
05:59:30.430 --> 05:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting you don't need it at
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
all well f is the effect on competitive
 
05:59:36.788 --> 05:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
markets right so that's another
 
05:59:40.468 --> 05:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
consideration that they have
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you all right let's see if we
 
05:59:45.628 --> 05:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
can hear from some other folks on this U
 
05:59:47.468 --> 05:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
legislation I know there's quite a few
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
folks here have signed up to give us
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
their perspective we might learn um more
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
from them so let's call on next Megan
 
05:59:57.468 --> 05:59:57.478 align:start position:0%
Stone and Matthew Young from the New
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
Matt Young and I'm an attorney with the
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
energy um the department is uh neutral
 
06:00:24.750 --> 06:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
on this legislation currently um I think
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the language that was in the
 
06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um coming into today we were
 
06:00:30.990 --> 06:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
a bit unclear on the intent and the
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
effect of the bill um I will after uh
 
06:00:36.510 --> 06:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
hearing representative McGee test Tony
 
06:00:39.830 --> 06:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I think I could offer a few points um
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
that might help some some
 
06:00:43.430 --> 06:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
context uh first which I think was
 
06:00:44.868 --> 06:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
discussed I just wanted to kind of
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize is that this bill uh
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with the uh 374 G
 
06:00:55.510 --> 06:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
projects I'll call them um since my time
 
06:00:57.628 --> 06:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
at the department I'm only aware of two
 
06:00:59.350 --> 06:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
such projects that have come before the
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission definitely
 
06:01:05.350 --> 06:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
one I think there's one other um and
 
06:01:05.360 --> 06:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
one I think there's one other um and
then

06:01:06.868 --> 06:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
I would also note that I believe Mr
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
chairman you mentioned what we're
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
calling I think the seven areas um or
 
06:01:13.390 --> 06:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
factors uh that are included in this
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
bill and several of those factors are
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
currently um being considered by the
 
06:01:22.310 --> 06:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission Now in
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
current dockets um I wouldn't say that
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
all of them are being considered but
 
06:01:29.708 --> 06:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
several of them are being considered in
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
fact um the extent to which the utility
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
does um provide that information is is
 
06:01:38.230 --> 06:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
is being considered and with that I'd be
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer some
 
06:01:43.430 --> 06:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay any questions for the
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
Department representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:01:48.548 --> 06:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you for
 
06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
being here um you just said that several
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
of those factors are currently being
 
06:01:57.270 --> 06:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
considered are but not all of them but
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
are there some decisions that are made
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are not including some of these
 
06:02:01.200 --> 06:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
that are not including some of these
factors

06:02:02.990 --> 06:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
factors
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
and could that could that lead
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
to not enough information on a
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
decision so the the um dockets that I
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
was speaking of aren't 374 G projects so
 
06:02:24.270 --> 06:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little different context um but
 
06:02:26.070 --> 06:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
the extent to which the utilities are
 
06:02:30.310 --> 06:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
providing um for an example I think data
 
06:02:32.350 --> 06:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
sharing um related to Consolidated
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
billing things like that are being
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
considered does that answer your
 
06:02:35.520 --> 06:02:36.910 align:start position:0%
considered does that answer your
question

06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:40.628 --> 06:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
follow up followup followup
 
06:02:43.150 --> 06:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
um so I think what I'm trying to say is
 
06:02:44.990 --> 06:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
if there if they're you're saying not
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
all of these factors are being
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
considered if they're if they're
 
06:02:50.110 --> 06:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
considering some of these factors in one
 
06:02:52.910 --> 06:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
case some of the different perhaps
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
different factors in another case how is
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm not sure I fully
 
06:03:05.788 --> 06:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
understand the question to be able to PR
 
06:03:10.030 --> 06:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
you okay any additional questions
 
06:03:13.040 --> 06:03:14.990 align:start position:0%
you okay any additional questions
representative

06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
you for being here uh the question I
 
06:03:25.948 --> 06:03:25.958 align:start position:0%
have is would uh does it seem like it it
 
06:03:28.150 --> 06:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
would these be considered uh just an
 
06:03:32.350 --> 06:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
encouragement as far as uh F here uh to
 
06:03:35.788 --> 06:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh be a little bit more specific to uh
 
06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
encourage due diligence on this matter
 
06:03:41.468 --> 06:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
so that these items are enumerated for
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
confidence I would say it definitely
 
06:03:49.310 --> 06:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
provides more specificity than is
 
06:03:51.750 --> 06:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
currently included thank you thank you
 
06:03:55.150 --> 06:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair okay thank
 
06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you chairman and
 
06:04:01.070 --> 06:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
think we taking my question I'm just
 
06:04:02.510 --> 06:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get this straight As who's
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to do what is it the Department's
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
position that if this was was passed
 
06:04:09.548 --> 06:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
into law that determining all of these
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
new factors now would be done by them
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
and submitted to the Pu or is it going
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to be just submitted to the Pu by the
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
utilities and no one in the department
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
of uh energy is going to look at it uh
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
how how do you Vision that working so um
 
06:04:25.830 --> 06:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
I would Envision similar to um one of
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
the other dockets that considered one of
 
06:04:30.270 --> 06:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
these projects uh it is the I would say
 
06:04:32.190 --> 06:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
it's the utilities burden to meet
 
06:04:33.830 --> 06:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
whatever statutory requirements are out
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
there um then the department does its
 
06:04:39.708 --> 06:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
review provides a recommendation um for
 
06:04:39.718 --> 06:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
review provides a recommendation um for
the

06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:43.390 --> 06:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
commission followup followup so you
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
would Envision then that the the utility
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
submitt would go to the doe for review
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then a recommendation back to the
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
commission so there would be people
 
06:04:55.590 --> 06:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
involved in doing this at the department
 
06:04:58.430 --> 06:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
of energy so I'm sorry they would file a
 
06:05:00.030 --> 06:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
petition at the Public Utilities
 
06:05:01.750 --> 06:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
Commission to which the department would
 
06:05:04.350 --> 06:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
be a party to that proceeding okay all
 
06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:05:12.468 --> 06:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
chair um the previous speaker talked
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
about these and and he identified them
 
06:05:18.430 --> 06:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
as new factors so are these new factors
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
or are they factors that are currently
 
06:05:23.708 --> 06:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
being um looked at by the
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
puc and if they are current factors then
 
06:05:31.548 --> 06:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.750 --> 06:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
them I would defer that question to the
 
06:05:35.310 --> 06:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
commission I don't know that their order
 
06:05:37.990 --> 06:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the recent proceeding was was
 
06:05:38.000 --> 06:05:42.750 align:start position:0%
on the on the recent proceeding was was
that

06:05:42.750 --> 06:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:44.670 --> 06:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
specific okay seeing no further
 
06:05:46.150 --> 06:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank the two of you
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
for testifying here today and I'd like
 
06:05:51.788 --> 06:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
to call on Henry hearnen from this

06:05:57.190 --> 06:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to give us his perspective on
 
06:05:57.200 --> 06:05:59.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to give us his perspective on
this

06:05:59.590 --> 06:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislation good afternoon Henry nice to
 
06:06:04.628 --> 06:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
see you again good afternoon Mr chairman
 
06:06:26.110 --> 06:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um members of the committee
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Henry hearen I am the
 
06:06:33.230 --> 06:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
director of member services with
 
06:06:34.670 --> 06:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
Community power Coalition of New
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are a not for-profit
 
06:06:39.230 --> 06:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
power agency and supplier governed by
 
06:06:42.110 --> 06:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
local communities here in the state um
 
06:06:44.590 --> 06:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
and operated by industry experts we uh
 
06:06:46.590 --> 06:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
part of what we do is expand competitive
 
06:06:48.510 --> 06:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
energy choices available to homes and
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and over the past couple of
 
06:06:52.590 --> 06:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
years since this Market has taken off in
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
the state um we have supported home uh
 
06:06:56.910 --> 06:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses to save more than
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
$20 million on their electric bills uh
 
06:07:01.548 --> 06:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
and we think there's a lot more value to
 
06:07:04.990 --> 06:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
be had with uh opportunities to uh
 
06:07:07.868 --> 06:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
expand and competitive opportunities in
 
06:07:11.070 --> 06:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
the energy space
 
06:07:14.030 --> 06:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm here to uh testify on behalf
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
of cbcn in support of House Bill 460
 
06:07:18.830 --> 06:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a an important tool in
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
helping to level the playing field
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
between utility companies and uh the
 
06:07:25.468 --> 06:07:25.478 align:start position:0%
competitive market in providing
 
06:07:27.468 --> 06:07:27.478 align:start position:0%
cost-saving Energy Solutions to
 
06:07:29.350 --> 06:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
customers so distributed energy
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
resources when they are cost-effective
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
um in the form of you know local
 
06:07:35.070 --> 06:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generators energy
 
06:07:35.080 --> 06:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generators energy
storage

06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
storage
 
06:07:39.150 --> 06:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
or other uh demand management tools can
 
06:07:41.788 --> 06:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
reduce wholesale power costs uh costs
 
06:07:44.070 --> 06:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
associated with the iso New England and
 
06:07:45.708 --> 06:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
costs associated with our Interstate
 
06:07:48.030 --> 06:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
transmission infrastructure by just
 
06:07:49.590 --> 06:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
producing power a little closer to home
 
06:07:51.708 --> 06:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
and not having to rely on those large
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
outof State uh infrastructures um and
 
06:07:55.868 --> 06:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
the associated
 
06:07:58.590 --> 06:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
costs part of the purpose of this uh
 
06:08:01.830 --> 06:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um is uh to address a
 
06:08:03.628 --> 06:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
challenge where currently State
 
06:08:05.948 --> 06:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
regulation is inadvertently
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
potentially granting utility companies a
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
monopoly on the development of these
 
06:08:12.270 --> 06:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
local power resources and undermining
 
06:08:14.310 --> 06:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
the ability of customers to have choice
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
and for the comp competitive market to
 
06:08:17.590 --> 06:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
innovate and provide some of those
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
solutions that can save costs for
 
06:08:22.190 --> 06:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
customers um there's some examples and
 
06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'll talk about at least one of
 
06:08:26.350 --> 06:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
them but uh utilities are proposing and
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
developing some distributed energy
 
06:08:30.430 --> 06:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
projects one good example i' I've passed
 
06:08:33.788 --> 06:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
around material from uni Till's proposal
 
06:08:36.310 --> 06:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh developing a five megawatt solar
 
06:08:38.310 --> 06:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
tracker tracker meaning it follows the
 
06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
sun um in Kingston New Hampshire now
 
06:08:44.030 --> 06:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
this is a good project supportive of
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
this project it's uh kudos to Unitil for
 
06:08:48.468 --> 06:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
sort of innovating and saying hey we can
 
06:08:50.510 --> 06:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
save customers money if we have a local
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
generator and if we look at all of the
 
06:08:54.910 --> 06:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
ways that can produce value for
 
06:08:54.920 --> 06:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
ways that can produce value for
customers

06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:08:59.670 --> 06:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and what that does is it lowers the
 
06:09:01.628 --> 06:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
Uni's costs from wholesale power
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
purchases from the transmission system
 
06:09:06.948 --> 06:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh and line losses and some other values
 
06:09:08.430 --> 06:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
we feel that this legislation is
 
06:09:10.468 --> 06:09:10.478 align:start position:0%
important in enabling the same
 
06:09:12.910 --> 06:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
justifications that allow the Monopoly
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
utility to create those projects those
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
same justifications should be available
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
on a competitive market basis to sort of
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
just expand choice and have the
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
competition create um ways to drive down
 
06:09:25.868 --> 06:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
cost for customers um so we would
 
06:09:29.070 --> 06:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
propose that this um bill should be
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
voted ought to pass uh to to bolster
 
06:09:32.910 --> 06:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
that market and I just want to respond
 
06:09:34.708 --> 06:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
to a couple of the the items that have
 
06:09:37.390 --> 06:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
been disc discussed I think a key
 
06:09:39.750 --> 06:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
feature was identified uh that this is
 
06:09:42.070 --> 06:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
the section relative to the effect on
 
06:09:44.628 --> 06:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
competition and it may I think perhaps
 
06:09:46.030 --> 06:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
there a little bit confusion the intent
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
is not to have more regulation the
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
intent is to have less regulation to
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
allow unregulated entities to uh have a
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field on some of the rules
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the utilities have and also what
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
was discussed is sort of what do these
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
factors have to do with competition and
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
I'll just maybe try to clarify that
 
06:10:03.878 --> 06:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
I'll just maybe try to clarify that
question

06:10:05.910 --> 06:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:10:09.510 --> 06:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so tariffs meters load estimation
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
these are the factors what do they have
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
to do with competition so what Unitil
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
has said is let's look at a tariff the
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
transmission tariff uh that sends a
 
06:10:20.110 --> 06:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
price signal it says that the monthly
 
06:10:23.670 --> 06:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
peak hour drives the transmission cost
 
06:10:26.708 --> 06:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
does my uh solar project produce power
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
during that monthly Peak now it's
 
06:10:30.468 --> 06:10:30.478 align:start position:0%
lowering my monthly Peak transmission
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
cost so that's the Tariff and perhaps
 
06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
the metering component do we have a
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
meter that measures that solar raise
 
06:10:38.430 --> 06:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
reduction to the transmission tariff
 
06:10:40.468 --> 06:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
then we could look at load estimation
 
06:10:42.270 --> 06:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
load estimation has to do with how much
 
06:10:44.910 --> 06:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
power do we estimate We Buy in ISO New
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
England well if we have a transmission
 
06:10:49.310 --> 06:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
tariff and we have a solar array and
 
06:10:51.070 --> 06:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
we're metering its production during the
 
06:10:53.070 --> 06:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
monthly transmission Peak we can now
 
06:10:55.708 --> 06:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
estimate a reduction in our load that we
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
buy from ISO New England these are the
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
rules that unisil has used to justify
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
that investment and they're good and
 
06:11:04.270 --> 06:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
they show look now we're paying less for
 
06:11:05.948 --> 06:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
power because we got a local project in
 
06:11:08.030 --> 06:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
ISO and transmission costs are going
 
06:11:10.830 --> 06:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
down what this legislation is suggesting
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
is that those factors that are
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
justifying Monopoly utility Investments
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be restricted to the Monopoly
 
06:11:19.788 --> 06:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
utility only inadvertently we have a
 
06:11:22.628 --> 06:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
situation where a competitive developer
 
06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
or competitive supplier are unable to
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
make that same cost-effective investment
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
and be paid for the lowering of the
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
transmission tariff the the reduction to
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
their estimated wholesale load um that's
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
why those factors are being listed and
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
that's why we feel this legislation is
 
06:11:40.468 --> 06:11:40.478 align:start position:0%
necessary to expand sort of a
 
06:11:42.430 --> 06:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
marketplace where customers can choose
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
some of those options um so I'll be
 
06:11:46.270 --> 06:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps speak more to the the specifics
 
06:11:49.510 --> 06:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the factors uh and I appreciate the
 
06:11:49.520 --> 06:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
of the factors uh and I appreciate the
committee's

06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
time thank you excellent testimony so do
 
06:11:58.430 --> 06:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
you think that the additions to this
 
06:12:01.868 --> 06:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
legislation as outlined in this bill
 
06:12:04.430 --> 06:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
will enable utilities when they're
 
06:12:06.670 --> 06:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
trying to recover their cost for invest
 
06:12:09.510 --> 06:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
investing in De distributed energy
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
resources to do something like what
 
06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
Unitil did in uh
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
estimating the effect
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
on their own rates tariffs Etc and so
 
06:12:27.030 --> 06:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
you think that putting this in statute
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
here will be beneficial to limited
 
06:12:35.670 --> 06:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
electrical producers under RSA uh 362a
 
06:12:37.708 --> 06:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
and and other customer generators is
 
06:12:40.468 --> 06:12:40.478 align:start position:0%
that is that the goal here yes the goal
 
06:12:42.868 --> 06:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
is perhaps maybe not comprehensively but
 
06:12:46.270 --> 06:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
in a stepwise fashion getting closer
 
06:12:48.788 --> 06:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
to good utilities are doing these
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
projects we can calculate then see that
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
they're saving power or saving money we
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
want to allow them on a limited basis
 
06:12:58.070 --> 06:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the what we've learned here and what
 
06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen about how the load estimation
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the tariffs and and these are being
 
06:13:05.110 --> 06:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
considered um to lower costs those fact
 
06:13:06.868 --> 06:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
factors we want to consider to make them
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
available to the competitive market as
 
06:13:10.708 --> 06:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
well so the utility can't discriminate
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
and say we can reduce our load
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
estimation and we can save cost but you
 
06:13:17.788 --> 06:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
the competitive supplier cannot your
 
06:13:20.270 --> 06:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
load estimation remains unchanged you
 
06:13:22.190 --> 06:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
are not able to lower your own costs
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
those would be socialized and said
 
06:13:26.310 --> 06:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's a current problem where load
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
estimation reductions for this for the
 
06:13:32.070 --> 06:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
non-utility projects under this section
 
06:13:35.670 --> 06:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
um they're socialized to all customers
 
06:13:38.150 --> 06:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
we as a supplier um we would like to
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
have power from a local project that
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
reduces how much power we have to buy in
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the iso New England and then not have to
 
06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
double pay for it not have
 
06:13:49.150 --> 06:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
to this would help to enable us to
 
06:13:50.910 --> 06:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
provide more cost savings by having the
 
06:13:50.920 --> 06:13:52.548 align:start position:0%
provide more cost savings by having the
same

06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
justifications follow-up question would
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
be do do any of the types
 
06:13:59.520 --> 06:14:02.110 align:start position:0%
be do do any of the types
of

06:14:02.110 --> 06:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:14:04.830 --> 06:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh materials that would be necessary to
 
06:14:09.628 --> 06:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
back up these these estimates of
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
competition um Market competition are
 
06:14:14.708 --> 06:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
any of
 
06:14:17.670 --> 06:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
those like proprietary data that the
 
06:14:21.628 --> 06:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
utilities would be reluctant to divulge
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
and so with imposing this kind of
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
requirement on them discourage them from
 
06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
doing these de
 
06:14:31.628 --> 06:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
projects not to my knowledge I don't
 
06:14:33.548 --> 06:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
believe so I don't believe that it would
 
06:14:37.510 --> 06:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
right and really you know in the Unitil
 
06:14:42.030 --> 06:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
example they've sort of done the good
 
06:14:45.868 --> 06:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
work of showing the value um and then
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
this would just provide that
 
06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
clarification to the commission and in
 
06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
future projects saying yes we approve
 
06:14:55.708 --> 06:14:55.718 align:start position:0%
you Unitil to do this project and allow
 
06:14:58.190 --> 06:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
apply the same load reduction and tariff
 
06:15:00.548 --> 06:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
methodology to a competitive market
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
actor so they can go and make their own
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
private investment and we don't have to
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
sort of rate base all the investments in
 
06:15:07.990 --> 06:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy we can just allow
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
private investment to do that without
 
06:15:13.948 --> 06:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
having the sort of regulated rate
 
06:15:17.230 --> 06:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
return other questions representative
 
06:15:19.150 --> 06:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you for taking my
 
06:15:19.160 --> 06:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you for taking my
question

06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a little confused here it
 
06:15:25.830 --> 06:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the electric utility
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
May seek rate recovery for a portion of
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
its investments in distributed energy
 
06:15:31.948 --> 06:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
but then you're talking about someone
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's who's investing in distributed
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
energy that's not a public utility
 
06:15:37.750 --> 06:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
so as part of the filing for the public
 
06:15:40.750 --> 06:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
utility they're supposed to say because
 
06:15:43.030 --> 06:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing this distributed generation
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
energy project it has some effect on
 
06:15:48.830 --> 06:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
making someone else's distributed energy
 
06:15:51.548 --> 06:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
project cheaper and they the utility was
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to calculate that and then give it
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
to whoever this somebody else is and
 
06:15:57.548 --> 06:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
then they'll get paid more or get credit
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
I'm just I don't understand how this is
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
working what if the utility doesn't file
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything yeah I I think that's a good
 
06:16:05.230 --> 06:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
question um I think I think the
 
06:16:08.430 --> 06:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
intention is um the the way the statute
 
06:16:11.708 --> 06:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
is already outlined there is a series of
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
factors that the Pu must consider ABCD
 
06:16:16.910 --> 06:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
one of those factors is what does the
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
effect on competition of the utility
 
06:16:21.868 --> 06:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
investment right now the effect on
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
competition is utilities have a certain
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
set of rules on load estimation that
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
they can use but the marketplace doesn't
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a fair access to that same set of
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
rules so we we feel that a Level Playing
 
06:16:35.868 --> 06:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
Field where the rule utilities are able
 
06:16:37.990 --> 06:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
to use to justify their investment
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be only available to the
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
utility and in the public utility
 
06:16:42.990 --> 06:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
commission's consideration of approving
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
that project again I'm not saying I
 
06:16:46.270 --> 06:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
don't think utilities should be able to
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
do some of these costeffective projects
 
06:16:51.190 --> 06:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
but in the commission's consideration of
 
06:16:53.468 --> 06:16:53.478 align:start position:0%
that those same justifications would now
 
06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
be opened up and made available to The
 
06:16:57.510 --> 06:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
Limited producers or the competitive
 
06:16:57.520 --> 06:16:58.788 align:start position:0%
Limited producers or the competitive
actors

06:16:58.788 --> 06:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
actors
 
06:17:01.708 --> 06:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
followup follow up yeah I I understand
 
06:17:03.070 --> 06:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
you want to have the same set of rules
 
06:17:04.510 --> 06:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
for everybody but I'm trying to get more
 
06:17:06.590 --> 06:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
practice IC on how this would work you
 
06:17:10.350 --> 06:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
have the utility filing a putting a rate
 
06:17:12.990 --> 06:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
case in for their distributed energy
 
06:17:14.750 --> 06:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
resource and they want to get their
 
06:17:16.190 --> 06:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
their money back and whatever and so
 
06:17:18.190 --> 06:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
forth so on and somehow in the process
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
of that filing they're going to
 
06:17:22.430 --> 06:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
calculate how much credit should be
 
06:17:25.390 --> 06:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
realized for in value produced and cost
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
avoided for comparable to those benefits
 
06:17:32.230 --> 06:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
for who some unnamed uh distributed
 
06:17:33.948 --> 06:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
generator or is they have to do this
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
monthly or is this done once a year what
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
if they don't invest in any distributed
 
06:17:39.910 --> 06:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
generation then and how is that credit
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
going to get to the private distributed
 
06:17:45.510 --> 06:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh energy um
 
06:17:47.910 --> 06:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
producer I don't know if I have an exact
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I think it's a
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
good question and I think again the
 
06:17:54.190 --> 06:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
intent is you know looking at the rates
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
tariffs metering data these are all the
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
things Unitil has done the homework and
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
they've looked at those things and shown
 
06:18:01.590 --> 06:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
look our load settlement has gone down
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
because we've got local power and then
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
it says um
 
06:18:07.390 --> 06:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know how does this enable customer
 
06:18:09.628 --> 06:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
generators and limited producers under
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
the law uh to be able to realize credit
 
06:18:13.948 --> 06:18:13.958 align:start position:0%
for Value produced and costs avoided
 
06:18:15.910 --> 06:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
comparable to those benefits claimed in
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
the electric utilities proposal so this
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
is again it's just saying utility you
 
06:18:22.990 --> 06:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
can still do your project you just
 
06:18:26.590 --> 06:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
cannot block a competitive market actor
 
06:18:28.750 --> 06:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
from doing a similar project and
 
06:18:32.670 --> 06:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
similarly using load estimation or uh
 
06:18:35.230 --> 06:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
tariffs or metering to
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
to be compensated the same way you're
 
06:18:39.510 --> 06:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
compensating yourself okay follow
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
up one more that's it okay that'll be it
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
I I understand the the basic you kind of
 
06:18:45.670 --> 06:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
come with the principle the same rule
 
06:18:47.948 --> 06:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
should apply to everybody if the utility
 
06:18:50.110 --> 06:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
puts in a two megawatt generation and
 
06:18:52.110 --> 06:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
they get so much credit for transmission
 
06:18:54.030 --> 06:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
savings or whatever then someone else
 
06:18:55.510 --> 06:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
doing that should get it I'm trying to
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
figure out the process because this is a
 
06:18:59.548 --> 06:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
filing that the utility makes so the
 
06:19:01.990 --> 06:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
utility is putting in a two gen two
 
06:19:04.510 --> 06:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar panel some Farm someplace
 
06:19:06.510 --> 06:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
they come up with and they come up with
 
06:19:08.468 --> 06:19:08.478 align:start position:0%
specific savings for that two two
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
megawatts in that location and then
 
06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
somehow someone else is going to put up
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
a one megawatt solar thing 150 miles
 
06:19:18.190 --> 06:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
away right and they're going to say well
 
06:19:20.110 --> 06:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they claimed in savings over
 
06:19:22.670 --> 06:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
there we're getting over here and of
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
course there's a difference here because
 
06:19:26.670 --> 06:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
the utility has to provide load so that
 
06:19:28.350 --> 06:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
two megawatts turns off because it's
 
06:19:29.708 --> 06:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
cloudy they go get the power from
 
06:19:31.548 --> 06:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
someplace else right the private One
 
06:19:33.030 --> 06:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt turns off because it's cloudy
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
they just don't run they get no penalty
 
06:19:36.708 --> 06:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
well so that would be under net metering
 
06:19:38.390 --> 06:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
but not under a limited producer or sort
 
06:19:40.110 --> 06:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
of a market construct I would agree with
 
06:19:42.350 --> 06:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
you and and again that's why if you
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
don't produce during the transmission
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
Peak we shouldn't pay you for saving
 
06:19:47.270 --> 06:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
transmission costs but if you produce
 
06:19:49.310 --> 06:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
during that then we would pay you and I
 
06:19:51.468 --> 06:19:51.478 align:start position:0%
think again this is there might be a
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
larger sort of look at how can we ensure
 
06:19:58.390 --> 06:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know the a correct retail Market in
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
the state I think this is at least
 
06:20:02.430 --> 06:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
saying to the Public Utility Commission
 
06:20:04.190 --> 06:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
when you're approving these projects ask
 
06:20:05.628 --> 06:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
are is the market able to play by the
 
06:20:10.310 --> 06:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
same rules that the utility is able to
 
06:20:12.750 --> 06:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
play by and if it's not then can we sort
 
06:20:14.990 --> 06:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
of try to enable that further so there's
 
06:20:15.000 --> 06:20:17.230 align:start position:0%
of try to enable that further so there's
more

06:20:17.230 --> 06:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:20:19.510 --> 06:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
competition representative
 
06:20:21.548 --> 06:20:21.558 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:20:25.230 --> 06:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hearn uh for coming in
 
06:20:28.548 --> 06:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
so these seven
 
06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
factors are they being appli I got a
 
06:20:32.670 --> 06:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
couple questions but are they being
 
06:20:35.468 --> 06:20:35.478 align:start position:0%
applied now in the regular
 
06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
utility rate case under this statute and
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
if they're not is your intent to make
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the investment in distributed generation
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
easier for utilities as well as for the
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
or uh they are being so in the Unitil
 
06:20:56.110 --> 06:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
example which I'll return to um they are
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
being applied Unitil is essentially
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
saying look um we have this much less
 
06:21:03.030 --> 06:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale energy cost this much less
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
wholesale capacity cost this much less
 
06:21:06.948 --> 06:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
transmission line loss ancillary
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
Services all the fees that are part of
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
the iso system um similarly there's you
 
06:21:13.948 --> 06:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
know there are State studies of what is
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
the value of a local load reducer or
 
06:21:17.948 --> 06:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resource and they
 
06:21:19.948 --> 06:21:19.958 align:start position:0%
look at all those same the cost stack
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
the value stack that we've discussed um
 
06:21:25.830 --> 06:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that we're trying to
 
06:21:29.190 --> 06:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
say we want more or less utility
 
06:21:31.708 --> 06:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
Investments as opposed to the bill was
 
06:21:34.830 --> 06:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
is just clarifying already the p is
 
06:21:36.230 --> 06:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
directed to look at the effect on
 
06:21:37.830 --> 06:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
competition we know the effect on
 
06:21:40.110 --> 06:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
competition is important to the state in
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
existing law these seven factors they're
 
06:21:46.750 --> 06:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of the how does it
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
affect competition and can certain
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
entities or utilities or monopolies use
 
06:21:53.708 --> 06:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
these factors one way what without
 
06:21:56.670 --> 06:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
letting Market actors do the same and we
 
06:21:58.150 --> 06:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
we feel that if Market actors were able
 
06:21:59.468 --> 06:21:59.478 align:start position:0%
to do the same we'd have a much more
 
06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
efficient deployment of those resources
 
06:22:03.548 --> 06:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
as opposed to having the Pu adjudicate
 
06:22:05.230 --> 06:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
each one for two years you could just
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
say hey did you produce during the
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
transmission Peak did it lower your load
 
06:22:10.868 --> 06:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
settlement we're going to do the load
 
06:22:14.070 --> 06:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
settlement math correctly
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
now okay representative Corman has a
 
06:22:19.310 --> 06:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman so just
 
06:22:21.750 --> 06:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
following on to what you just said um
 
06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
would it be correct to characterize this
 
06:22:26.590 --> 06:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
as as saying that by having this
 
06:22:29.070 --> 06:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
information explicitly
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
included that it creates a more
 
06:22:34.830 --> 06:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
efficient market
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
we I I would suggest it would be a step
 
06:22:38.990 --> 06:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
in that direction yes I think it would
 
06:22:41.708 --> 06:22:41.718 align:start position:0%
it again it's it it puts to the
 
06:22:43.708 --> 06:22:43.718 align:start position:0%
consideration what are the factors that
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
are being used to justify this and is
 
06:22:47.190 --> 06:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
there is it kind of done on a
 
06:22:49.150 --> 06:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
discriminatory basis or is it on an open
 
06:22:50.788 --> 06:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
access basis so I think that would be a
 
06:22:53.030 --> 06:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
step towards creating a more efficient
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
market there's perhaps other the our
 
06:22:58.830 --> 06:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
retail Market in the state there perhaps
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
a number of things that would be needed
 
06:23:04.750 --> 06:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
to make a truly competitive and when I
 
06:23:06.990 --> 06:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
say retail market we've we've succeeded
 
06:23:08.830 --> 06:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
at a wholesale level we have the iso New
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
England there's real-time price signals
 
06:23:12.990 --> 06:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's based on supply and demand it's a
 
06:23:14.628 --> 06:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
true marketplace where generators are
 
06:23:17.430 --> 06:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
competing at a retail level we don't
 
06:23:18.868 --> 06:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
have the price
 
06:23:21.150 --> 06:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
signals uh and we don't have some of
 
06:23:23.708 --> 06:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
these other factors like the load
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
estimation and the Open Access so there
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
is perhaps a broader conversation about
 
06:23:31.150 --> 06:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
how do we truly establish Market
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
competition in a New Hampshire level at
 
06:23:35.548 --> 06:23:35.558 align:start position:0%
a retail level uh that can alleviate
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
some of the costs of the iso I think
 
06:23:39.190 --> 06:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is a step in that direction but not
 
06:23:41.670 --> 06:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive
 
06:23:43.910 --> 06:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
solution okay seeing no other questions
 
06:23:45.270 --> 06:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you that's excellent
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
testimony as usual from the CPC and so
 
06:23:51.270 --> 06:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
next we'll hear the perspective of
 
06:23:55.230 --> 06:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
eversource as Michael Lata will give us
 
06:23:57.910 --> 06:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
the utilities perspective on this
 
06:23:57.920 --> 06:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
the utilities perspective on this
proposed

06:23:59.030 --> 06:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.030 --> 06:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for the record
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
Michael Lata representing eversource uh
 
06:24:14.590 --> 06:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
energy appreciate the opportunity to
 
06:24:18.430 --> 06:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
testify before you today um a lot of
 
06:24:20.788 --> 06:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has had and
 
06:24:23.070 --> 06:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps part of the source of
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is how the bill is is structured um
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
as has been discussed the bill would add
 
06:24:32.468 --> 06:24:32.478 align:start position:0%
several up just for the record again uh
 
06:24:35.468 --> 06:24:35.478 align:start position:0%
ever source is opposed to the bill uh
 
06:24:39.150 --> 06:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
that is has as it has been introduced
 
06:24:42.150 --> 06:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
um the bill would add several new
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
factors and it's important to state that
 
06:24:47.548 --> 06:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
those are new factors they are not a uh
 
06:24:49.150 --> 06:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
something that is currently under
 
06:24:51.270 --> 06:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
consideration when the Public Utilities
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
Commission is reviewing utility
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
Investments as part of 374 G um and
 
06:24:58.110 --> 06:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
these are the factors that the
 
06:25:00.468 --> 06:25:00.478 align:start position:0%
commission does take into account and
 
06:25:03.310 --> 06:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
weigh when determining if those specific
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
projects that a utility is proposing are
 
06:25:08.670 --> 06:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
in the public interest and I think it's
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
really really important to focus on the
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
fact that the commission is reviewing
 
06:25:16.548 --> 06:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
the costs the benefits the manner in
 
06:25:19.270 --> 06:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
which a utility went about con proposing
 
06:25:22.868 --> 06:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
to construct these projects this is not
 
06:25:26.468 --> 06:25:26.478 align:start position:0%
um done on a Statewide basis it is very
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
Project Specific it's location specific
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh it is not tied uh to a a broader
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
kind of policy issue um we believe that
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
the current factors are in fact clear
 
06:25:42.150 --> 06:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
and well understood uh and they also
 
06:25:44.350 --> 06:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
make sense when determining whether a
 
06:25:46.110 --> 06:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
specific project is in the public
 
06:25:48.670 --> 06:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
interest if you review the statute there
 
06:25:51.910 --> 06:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
are items such as uh whether the project
 
06:25:54.150 --> 06:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
would impact the safety reliability of
 
06:25:56.670 --> 06:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
the grid the costs the benefits the
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and the addition
 
06:26:02.788 --> 06:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
of these new factors uh we believe are
 
06:26:05.590 --> 06:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
are unclear and do not appear to be
 
06:26:07.390 --> 06:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with the evaluation of a
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
specific project and the cost and
 
06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
benefits of that project instead the new
 
06:26:15.990 --> 06:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
factors appear to shift the entire
 
06:26:18.270 --> 06:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
conversation at the Public Utilities
 
06:26:20.628 --> 06:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
Commission instead of being a review of
 
06:26:23.590 --> 06:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
the project is now would be based on
 
06:26:25.910 --> 06:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not an unregulated third
 
06:26:29.670 --> 06:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
party has a some form of compensation
 
06:26:31.190 --> 06:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
for their
 
06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
competitive uh distributed energy
 
06:26:33.760 --> 06:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
competitive uh distributed energy
resources

06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
resources
 
06:26:38.510 --> 06:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
which quite frankly if you look at 374 G
 
06:26:40.948 --> 06:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
it is very clear and very specific and
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
there are very clear limitations on the
 
06:26:46.190 --> 06:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
types of projects that utilities are
 
06:26:48.390 --> 06:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to construct third parties don't
 
06:26:50.910 --> 06:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
have to uh nor should they have any of
 
06:26:55.070 --> 06:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
those limitations applied to them uh so
 
06:26:57.468 --> 06:26:57.478 align:start position:0%
you're taking the review and cost
 
06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
benefit and public interest finding of a
 
06:27:02.910 --> 06:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
specific project and shifting that
 
06:27:05.868 --> 06:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
conversation to should unregulated
 
06:27:10.070 --> 06:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
third-party competitive uh projects have
 
06:27:12.350 --> 06:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
some form of distrib some form of
 
06:27:14.310 --> 06:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
compensation that would ultimately be
 
06:27:18.230 --> 06:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
provided for uh by customers uh we don't
 
06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe that that's helpful we don't
 
06:27:21.548 --> 06:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
believe that that's in keeping with the
 
06:27:24.190 --> 06:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
intent of 374 G and I would also point
 
06:27:28.150 --> 06:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
out that as was discussed 374 G has only
 
06:27:30.350 --> 06:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
been used successfully once in the state
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and candidly it is
 
06:27:34.708 --> 06:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
disappointing to see
 
06:27:37.468 --> 06:27:37.478 align:start position:0%
the legislature contemplating after the
 
06:27:40.030 --> 06:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
one successful project stepping in and
 
06:27:42.190 --> 06:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
changing the rules of the game for
 
06:27:44.350 --> 06:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
utilities uh this would have a chilling
 
06:27:46.030 --> 06:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
effect on utility investment and
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
candidly with this new language it's
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
unclear whether we would even be able to
 
06:27:53.548 --> 06:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
uh continue to provide or or look for
 
06:27:56.070 --> 06:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
Investments uh similar to the Unitil
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
Kingston project um there were a number
 
06:28:03.310 --> 06:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
of statements made by uh the gentleman
 
06:28:06.110 --> 06:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh Mr hearnen from Community power I I
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
think a number of them are factually
 
06:28:10.910 --> 06:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect uh stating that utilities are
 
06:28:12.548 --> 06:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
blocking investment stating that
 
06:28:14.708 --> 06:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
utilities have a monopoly on distributed
 
06:28:19.110 --> 06:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
energy resources uh simply put uh we
 
06:28:20.590 --> 06:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally disagree with those
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
normally I wouldn't comment on another
 
06:28:26.350 --> 06:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know testifiers
 
06:28:29.990 --> 06:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh Speech uh but those were far
 
06:28:32.750 --> 06:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the pale and uh quite frankly we
 
06:28:34.750 --> 06:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
feel the need to say on the record that
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
that is uh certainly our belief that
 
06:28:39.788 --> 06:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
those are factually incorrect statements
 
06:28:41.590 --> 06:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any uh
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:49.110 --> 06:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
have well thank you for your uh candid
 
06:28:51.910 --> 06:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I do have a question it would
 
06:28:54.868 --> 06:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
appear that the intent of this
 
06:28:57.628 --> 06:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
legislation is to codify and
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute some Concepts that
 
06:29:06.750 --> 06:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:10.030 --> 06:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
prove Concepts like avoided load avoided
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution cost
 
06:29:13.990 --> 06:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
avoided line
 
06:29:16.110 --> 06:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
losses when you apply those to
 
06:29:18.150 --> 06:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources because
 
06:29:20.830 --> 06:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
they're intermittent
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
resources isn't it difficult to figure
 
06:29:25.390 --> 06:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
out exactly if they're if they even
 
06:29:27.868 --> 06:29:27.878 align:start position:0%
exist much less what how to quantify
 
06:29:32.070 --> 06:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
them I I I think there there seems to be
 
06:29:34.990 --> 06:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
a fundamental disconnect
 
06:29:35.000 --> 06:29:36.948 align:start position:0%
a fundamental disconnect
um

06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:39.670 --> 06:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
between and again I I don't work at
 
06:29:41.750 --> 06:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
Unitil as the committee knows I I really
 
06:29:44.750 --> 06:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
can't speak to uh their Kingston filing
 
06:29:46.390 --> 06:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
however there does seem to be a
 
06:29:50.510 --> 06:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
disconnect between the interpretation by
 
06:29:54.190 --> 06:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh one Community power organization of
 
06:29:57.190 --> 06:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
the utilities positioning and what
 
06:30:00.468 --> 06:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
they're seeking so
 
06:30:02.830 --> 06:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to speak in more general
 
06:30:04.590 --> 06:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
terms because I I you know
 
06:30:07.150 --> 06:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
Unitil can speak about their project but
 
06:30:09.990 --> 06:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
essentially when they were uh when a
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
utility is making the filing with the
 
06:30:14.750 --> 06:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission they're
 
06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
showing that the benefits of the project
 
06:30:19.590 --> 06:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
outweigh the costs so how much do it
 
06:30:22.430 --> 06:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
cost to build and the utilities rate of
 
06:30:23.788 --> 06:30:23.798 align:start position:0%
return which is
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
regulated um and what are the benefits
 
06:30:29.510 --> 06:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of different
 
06:30:34.150 --> 06:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that utilities could could show
 
06:30:35.750 --> 06:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh compliance with the renewable
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard for example that
 
06:30:40.430 --> 06:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
these are essentially wreck generating
 
06:30:43.030 --> 06:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
if there are uh you know exports at the
 
06:30:44.750 --> 06:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
time of coincident Peak as has been
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
discussed there can be uh transmission
 
06:30:50.788 --> 06:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
benefits associated with that or um
 
06:30:54.190 --> 06:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
capacity benefits those are cost savings
 
06:30:58.310 --> 06:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
so those are are estimated exports that
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
you model out May save customers money
 
06:31:05.788 --> 06:31:05.798 align:start position:0%
that is very very different than saying
 
06:31:07.510 --> 06:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
and this is not has not been the
 
06:31:09.190 --> 06:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
position of the utilities that they
 
06:31:12.388 --> 06:31:12.398 align:start position:0%
should be compensated on those estimated
 
06:31:15.750 --> 06:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
levels and so it's very different to say
 
06:31:18.468 --> 06:31:18.478 align:start position:0%
all customers will receive a benefit
 
06:31:20.230 --> 06:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
from this because we are estimating
 
06:31:23.548 --> 06:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
certain savings versus write me a check
 
06:31:26.430 --> 06:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
for that those are two very different
 
06:31:28.230 --> 06:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
things and if you cons if you walk
 
06:31:29.830 --> 06:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
through and I think representative
 
06:31:34.150 --> 06:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
Harrington was trying to to go there how
 
06:31:36.430 --> 06:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
would that happen how what's the
 
06:31:39.750 --> 06:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
mechanics of providing that benefit back
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that a third-party
 
06:31:47.030 --> 06:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
unregulated generator has exported at
 
06:31:49.070 --> 06:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
the same time as the coincident
 
06:31:52.830 --> 06:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
transmission Peak and so had that export
 
06:31:54.868 --> 06:31:54.878 align:start position:0%
not occurred the transmission Peak would
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
be higher so the utility then has to
 
06:31:59.948 --> 06:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
artificially increase their transmission
 
06:32:03.030 --> 06:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
costs to create a revenue stream to
 
06:32:05.788 --> 06:32:05.798 align:start position:0%
provide back to that generator so in
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
effect you're increasing costs to all
 
06:32:11.310 --> 06:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
customers in order to write a check to
 
06:32:13.948 --> 06:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
an unregulated third party again the
 
06:32:16.590 --> 06:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it get kind of messy and
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
slippery very quickly and all that to
 
06:32:22.990 --> 06:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
say we don't believe any of that should
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
be part of a UT part of the public
 
06:32:28.590 --> 06:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission's review of whether
 
06:32:31.468 --> 06:32:31.478 align:start position:0%
the costs and the benefits of a very
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
specific utility investment
 
06:32:41.150 --> 06:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
interest thank you thank you
 
06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
06:32:46.750 --> 06:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:32:48.750 --> 06:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question getting back to what
 
06:32:50.350 --> 06:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
we we kind of just refer to there I'm
 
06:32:52.388 --> 06:32:52.398 align:start position:0%
still trying to figure how this would
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
work because it appears that the let's
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
say eversource decides they're going to
 
06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
put in a 3 megawatt uh solar panel in uh
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know in Portsmouth uh uh new
 
06:33:03.520 --> 06:33:04.708 align:start position:0%
I don't know in Portsmouth uh uh new
hampsh

06:33:04.708 --> 06:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
hampsh
 
06:33:06.590 --> 06:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
now they put it in and they estimate
 
06:33:07.948 --> 06:33:07.958 align:start position:0%
that there going to it's going to save
 
06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
this and it's going to you're going to
 
06:33:10.388 --> 06:33:10.398 align:start position:0%
get benefits because you can get wrecks
 
06:33:12.590 --> 06:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
from it and it's going to Peak shave or
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you come up with some type of
 
06:33:16.510 --> 06:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
an estimate of of the cost savings and
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
put it against the cost benefit and and
 
06:33:20.190 --> 06:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
if it comes out positive then you'll
 
06:33:21.708 --> 06:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
build it and hopefully the commission
 
06:33:23.830 --> 06:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
would approve it so then you have those
 
06:33:26.510 --> 06:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but now somebody else decides
 
06:33:29.070 --> 06:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
two months later they want to build a
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
let's say the same thing a 2 megawatt
 
06:33:32.350 --> 06:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
solar project but they want to build it
 
06:33:34.708 --> 06:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
in coldbrook and there's a whole
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
different uh transmission system
 
06:33:38.590 --> 06:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
distribution's different the location's
 
06:33:40.788 --> 06:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
different so under this I guess they
 
06:33:42.350 --> 06:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
would just say well whatever they saved
 
06:33:44.548 --> 06:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth we want credit for here
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
does that is that kind of the logic of
 
06:33:47.948 --> 06:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
this that's that's what I'm reading
 
06:33:51.708 --> 06:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
it I don't know if that is the intent I
 
06:33:53.590 --> 06:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a fair question that you're
 
06:33:56.750 --> 06:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
asking I I would note that um what I
 
06:33:58.468 --> 06:33:58.478 align:start position:0%
believe you heard from the Department of
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
energy is many of these Concepts around
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
load settlement Consolidated billing the
 
06:34:09.708 --> 06:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
data sharing that goes on between the
 
06:34:13.868 --> 06:34:13.878 align:start position:0%
utilities and um thirdparty aggregations
 
06:34:16.510 --> 06:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
are currently being discussed as part of
 
06:34:18.910 --> 06:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
active adjudications at the Public
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and I know that
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
there are because they're available
 
06:34:25.110 --> 06:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
several other bills that will come
 
06:34:28.270 --> 06:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
before you today on those same topics so
 
06:34:30.910 --> 06:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if it's trying to force a
 
06:34:34.430 --> 06:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
resolution in those active adjudication
 
06:34:36.670 --> 06:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
I I
 
06:34:40.670 --> 06:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
I it confuses us as well okay follow up
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
follow up only one this time uh so the
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
way I read this as well then is if a
 
06:34:48.628 --> 06:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
period goes by two three four years and
 
06:34:50.830 --> 06:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
the utility doesn't opt to do one of
 
06:34:53.070 --> 06:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
these distributed energy projects it's
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
up to them they they're not being forced
 
06:34:57.670 --> 06:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
to do it so then somebody else wants to
 
06:34:59.388 --> 06:34:59.398 align:start position:0%
put in a third party one they're going
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
to look and say we want to save this
 
06:35:03.708 --> 06:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
well there's no analysis has been done
 
06:35:05.310 --> 06:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
how am I going to get my credit I mean
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
is that the open question here if
 
06:35:09.030 --> 06:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's none performed by the utility
 
06:35:10.708 --> 06:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
then there's no basis for determining
 
06:35:12.590 --> 06:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
the credit so how do you assign someone
 
06:35:15.830 --> 06:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
credit for a third party I I I think
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question all right thank
 
06:35:21.788 --> 06:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
you rhetorical but fair representative U
 
06:35:24.190 --> 06:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair and
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually this may be a point of order um
 
06:35:32.150 --> 06:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall um in last term or
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
this term one respected testifier
 
06:35:37.468 --> 06:35:37.478 align:start position:0%
questioning another well-respected
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
testifier integrity and
 
06:35:42.590 --> 06:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
honesty um could we please invite the
 
06:35:44.830 --> 06:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
original testifier back to clarify and
 
06:35:47.110 --> 06:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
defend their
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
statements well I'm going to have to
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
disagree with you that Mr Lata somehow
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
imputed the
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
U the honesty of Mr Heen I think what he
 
06:36:01.548 --> 06:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
was criticizing was or disagreeing with
 
06:36:05.468 --> 06:36:05.478 align:start position:0%
was Mr hen's fact acts and ideas so I
 
06:36:08.430 --> 06:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
don't see it's necessary to allow Mr
 
06:36:11.230 --> 06:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hern to come back and defend himself I
 
06:36:14.830 --> 06:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
know he can defend himself very ably uh
 
06:36:18.510 --> 06:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
but Mr Lata is entitled to disagree with
 
06:36:20.388 --> 06:36:20.398 align:start position:0%
what Mr hearnen
 
06:36:22.948 --> 06:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
presented any other questions
 
06:36:25.548 --> 06:36:25.558 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Lata um I'll go back to
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
my original point in a previous question
 
06:36:31.510 --> 06:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
which is the underlying statute
 
06:36:33.070 --> 06:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
identifies distributed generation
 
06:36:35.310 --> 06:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
resources as a as a priority for our
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
state in terms of utility Investments
 
06:36:39.910 --> 06:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to we want to activate that
 
06:36:43.070 --> 06:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
by this statute um and we also know that
 
06:36:45.150 --> 06:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
there's been a very slow uptake of this
 
06:36:47.190 --> 06:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity on the part of the
 
06:36:50.670 --> 06:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
utilities so and you're also saying that
 
06:36:52.430 --> 06:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
these seven factors have nothing to do
 
06:36:54.350 --> 06:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
with your business model and won't help
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
at all so what are the factors that we
 
06:36:59.948 --> 06:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at in order to
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
incentivize the utilities to take up
 
06:37:04.230 --> 06:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
more investment and distributed
 
06:37:07.070 --> 06:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
generation if these aren't the
 
06:37:10.830 --> 06:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
ones so I think it's fair to say that
 
06:37:14.830 --> 06:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:18.670 --> 06:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
um limited execution of this portion of
 
06:37:21.708 --> 06:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
the statute by the utilities there had
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
been previous orders and positions by
 
06:37:27.388 --> 06:37:27.398 align:start position:0%
previous Public Utilities commissions
 
06:37:31.190 --> 06:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
that sort of cast uh at least forever
 
06:37:34.430 --> 06:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
Source concern that invest ments using
 
06:37:36.430 --> 06:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
this uh this portion of the statute
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
would not be well looked upon by the
 
06:37:41.150 --> 06:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and so
 
06:37:43.670 --> 06:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
utilities at least ever Source uh
 
06:37:45.468 --> 06:37:45.478 align:start position:0%
determined that it was probably not an
 
06:37:48.990 --> 06:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
area of focus I I will say uh and you
 
06:37:51.750 --> 06:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
know much kudos to Unitil for
 
06:37:56.270 --> 06:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
structuring a um a a good uh filing that
 
06:37:58.750 --> 06:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
was able to get puc approval and in some
 
06:38:01.030 --> 06:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
ways showing a pathway forward for other
 
06:38:04.110 --> 06:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
utilities about how to to move forward
 
06:38:07.030 --> 06:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
on this I I will say that eversource is
 
06:38:09.990 --> 06:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
actively uh considering
 
06:38:12.110 --> 06:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
multiple potential investment
 
06:38:14.310 --> 06:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities under this and obviously
 
06:38:16.590 --> 06:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
changes to the statute would have a
 
06:38:22.030 --> 06:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:24.270 --> 06:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
testified okay seeing no further
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
questions I'll uh turn next and thank
 
06:38:29.788 --> 06:38:29.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lata turn next to clean energy
 
06:38:31.990 --> 06:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and invite Sam Evans Brown
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
back up to talk with us
 
06:38:36.628 --> 06:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
to give us uh his perspective on this
 
06:38:36.638 --> 06:38:39.708 align:start position:0%
to give us uh his perspective on this
proposed

06:38:39.708 --> 06:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:41.830 --> 06:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:38:42.990 --> 06:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee the hour is
 
06:38:45.070 --> 06:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
getting late uh and so I'll try to be
 
06:38:48.350 --> 06:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
brief uh I think probably much of the
 
06:38:49.788 --> 06:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
substance of this is already been hashed
 
06:38:51.708 --> 06:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
out but i' I'd maybe like to try to pull
 
06:38:53.548 --> 06:38:53.558 align:start position:0%
the camera up a little bit to a slightly
 
06:38:56.110 --> 06:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
more 30,000 foot view of this particular
 
06:38:59.350 --> 06:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
issue um Clin H is neutral on the bill
 
06:39:01.430 --> 06:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
as as introduced I think that some of
 
06:39:02.670 --> 06:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
the questions about how to
 
06:39:05.230 --> 06:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
operationalize this are are worthy ones
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
I think the concept though is a is a
 
06:39:09.868 --> 06:39:09.878 align:start position:0%
good one the two studies that I think
 
06:39:11.150 --> 06:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
the committee should really turn their
 
06:39:12.788 --> 06:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
attention to that have been filed at the
 
06:39:14.910 --> 06:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission are the
 
06:39:16.510 --> 06:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
value of distributed energy resources
 
06:39:18.750 --> 06:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
study and more importantly I think the
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
locational value of distributed
 
06:39:22.788 --> 06:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
generation study which which came out
 
06:39:26.628 --> 06:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
prior to the VD report um the the VD
 
06:39:28.270 --> 06:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
report really is the justification for
 
06:39:29.750 --> 06:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
the net metering tariffs that we have
 
06:39:31.830 --> 06:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
today it essentially says that
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
smallscale distributed gener connected
 
06:39:36.388 --> 06:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
to the distribution grid as opposed to
 
06:39:38.548 --> 06:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
the bulk transmission grid has extra
 
06:39:40.868 --> 06:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
value and that's why we give extra
 
06:39:43.310 --> 06:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
compensation to net metered projects the
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
locational value study sort of you know
 
06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
further elaborates on on that and says
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
on certain spots on the grid there's
 
06:39:52.750 --> 06:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
even more value to generation because
 
06:39:54.548 --> 06:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
you have circuits that are stressed you
 
06:39:56.430 --> 06:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
have load Pockets you have you know
 
06:39:58.350 --> 06:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
upcoming utility Investments that can be
 
06:40:00.388 --> 06:40:00.398 align:start position:0%
deferred with an investment in
 
06:40:02.708 --> 06:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
generation as opposed to just more uh
 
06:40:05.788 --> 06:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
sort of uh uh you know substations and
 
06:40:08.910 --> 06:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
poles and wires um the the I think the
 
06:40:10.750 --> 06:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
the Nuance here that's interesting is
 
06:40:14.190 --> 06:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
that uh currently a third-party Merchant
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
developer has no insight into which are
 
06:40:19.190 --> 06:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
those circuits that would benefit from
 
06:40:21.310 --> 06:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
additional generation they have no way
 
06:40:23.388 --> 06:40:23.398 align:start position:0%
to monetize that additional benefit on
 
06:40:25.030 --> 06:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
those additional circuits and when you
 
06:40:27.110 --> 06:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
read the you know I apologize for the
 
06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
acronym with the lvg the locational
 
06:40:31.030 --> 06:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
value study what you see is that there's
 
06:40:34.270 --> 06:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of discrepancy between the
 
06:40:35.548 --> 06:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
value on different circuits there are
 
06:40:37.990 --> 06:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
circuits in which additional generation
 
06:40:39.990 --> 06:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any additional value and
 
06:40:41.070 --> 06:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
there there are circuits on which
 
06:40:42.708 --> 06:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
additional generation provides huge
 
06:40:45.430 --> 06:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
amounts of value um other states have
 
06:40:47.190 --> 06:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
have recognized this and they have
 
06:40:49.270 --> 06:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
created tariffs they have created
 
06:40:51.070 --> 06:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
programs they've created they've created
 
06:40:53.230 --> 06:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
price signals that allow you to get
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
additional compensation if you're
 
06:40:58.030 --> 06:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
putting generation close to load on on
 
06:41:00.628 --> 06:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
circuits that are stressed uh so in
 
06:41:03.310 --> 06:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
particular Vermont has a very you know
 
06:41:05.510 --> 06:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
much publicized battery storage uh
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
incentive and and essentially you get
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
paid extra your incentive is doubled if
 
06:41:12.590 --> 06:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
you do battery storage that is
 
06:41:15.948 --> 06:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
controlled by the utility and is on a
 
06:41:17.788 --> 06:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
circuit that is that is has been
 
06:41:19.750 --> 06:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
identified as a circuit in need of
 
06:41:23.110 --> 06:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
additional support um and so I think uh
 
06:41:25.590 --> 06:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
while while the specific language of the
 
06:41:27.388 --> 06:41:27.398 align:start position:0%
bill and I think the the questions about
 
06:41:28.788 --> 06:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
how you would operationalize this and
 
06:41:31.070 --> 06:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
what it means are all valid questions um
 
06:41:33.750 --> 06:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's a really important idea that there
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
are currently uh uh elements of the
 
06:41:38.190 --> 06:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
value stack that's been alluded to
 
06:41:40.510 --> 06:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times that that third-party
 
06:41:43.548 --> 06:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
developers have no way to access uh it's
 
06:41:45.350 --> 06:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it would be a valuable discussion
 
06:41:47.708 --> 06:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
with our Utility Partners as to how you
 
06:41:49.548 --> 06:41:49.558 align:start position:0%
could structure some sort of rate or
 
06:41:51.788 --> 06:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
tariff or program that would create the
 
06:41:54.030 --> 06:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
price signal that's being asked for here
 
06:41:56.830 --> 06:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm hopeful that despite the
 
06:41:58.190 --> 06:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the community power
 
06:41:59.590 --> 06:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
Coalition and eversource about this
 
06:42:01.150 --> 06:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
specific Bild that that's a conversation
 
06:42:05.030 --> 06:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:07.270 --> 06:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you very much questions
 
06:42:12.030 --> 06:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
Brown well seeing none thank you we'll
 
06:42:18.590 --> 06:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
close our public hearing today by
 
06:42:22.628 --> 06:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
hearing from Unitil Alex Oma is going to
 
06:42:26.190 --> 06:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
come up and talk to us um about his
 
06:42:28.070 --> 06:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
perspective on this bill and having been
 
06:42:31.590 --> 06:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
he in um intimately involved with the
 
06:42:31.600 --> 06:42:33.310 align:start position:0%
he in um intimately involved with the
Unitil

06:42:33.310 --> 06:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
Unitil
 
06:42:35.750 --> 06:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
project that Mr hearnen referred to
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
earlier he can answer a lot of questions
 
06:42:40.990 --> 06:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
that we might have so Mr
 
06:42:43.388 --> 06:42:43.398 align:start position:0%
Romera welcome don't forget to turn on
 
06:42:43.398 --> 06:42:44.270 align:start position:0%
Romera welcome don't forget to turn on
the

06:42:44.270 --> 06:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:42:47.510 --> 06:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
mic I see that now thank you very much
 
06:42:48.788 --> 06:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh I'll do the best to answer the
 
06:42:51.230 --> 06:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
questions as I can for the record as
 
06:42:53.708 --> 06:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
noted my name is alak oma I'm here to
 
06:42:56.628 --> 06:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
represent Unitil and our ears are
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
collectively burning we've been
 
06:43:00.990 --> 06:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
discussed quite a bit here and recognize
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
why uh wanted to talk a little little
 
06:43:06.868 --> 06:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
bit about uh our project as it stands uh
 
06:43:09.750 --> 06:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
clarify a few points in regards to what
 
06:43:12.430 --> 06:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
the value of the Kingston solar array is
 
06:43:15.110 --> 06:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
for our customers and talk a little bit
 
06:43:17.270 --> 06:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
about uh some of the dockets and
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
adjudication proceedings that are
 
06:43:20.190 --> 06:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
happening around this because I think
 
06:43:20.200 --> 06:43:20.990 align:start position:0%
happening around this because I think
it's

06:43:20.990 --> 06:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:43:23.670 --> 06:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
relevant uh first and foremost when we
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
talk about the value to our customers
 
06:43:28.350 --> 06:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
and the cost benefit analysis that
 
06:43:30.830 --> 06:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
happened with our solar array and for
 
06:43:32.388 --> 06:43:32.398 align:start position:0%
anyone here who isn't familiar with our
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
solar array was approved ground broke on
 
06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
it last year we're expecting it to come
 
06:43:39.788 --> 06:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
online later this year uh the cost
 
06:43:41.830 --> 06:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis specifically was
 
06:43:45.628 --> 06:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
looking to the value that the de project
 
06:43:48.388 --> 06:43:48.398 align:start position:0%
provides to our overall distribution
 
06:43:50.708 --> 06:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
system uh we talked about there's been a
 
06:43:53.230 --> 06:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
lot of talk today about uh reimbursement
 
06:43:55.990 --> 06:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and compensation uh this is really an
 
06:43:57.868 --> 06:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
offset I think that's the right way to
 
06:43:59.230 --> 06:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
think about what the value of this
 
06:44:01.628 --> 06:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
project is for our customers because of
 
06:44:03.430 --> 06:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
the energy that is being generated ated
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
by this project is localized it does
 
06:44:08.190 --> 06:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity to lower the
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
overall transmission costs that we have
 
06:44:12.350 --> 06:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
and lower the distribution costs
 
06:44:14.110 --> 06:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
effectively because it is part of our
 
06:44:18.310 --> 06:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
distribution system this de project will
 
06:44:20.310 --> 06:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
allow us to operate our distribution
 
06:44:23.628 --> 06:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
system more efficient more efficiently
 
06:44:26.750 --> 06:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
what that means is that the system as a
 
06:44:30.430 --> 06:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
whole will lower costs for all Unitil
 
06:44:32.590 --> 06:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
customers that is all Unitil electric
 
06:44:36.070 --> 06:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
customers in New Hampshire universally
 
06:44:37.868 --> 06:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
it benefits all customers whether they
 
06:44:39.948 --> 06:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
are on any kind of Supply if they're on
 
06:44:41.788 --> 06:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
default Supply if they're on Supply from
 
06:44:44.628 --> 06:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
a third party provider the system itself
 
06:44:47.030 --> 06:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
lowers other costs and that provides the
 
06:44:49.430 --> 06:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefit for our customers that's
 
06:44:51.510 --> 06:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
different than saying that it provides a
 
06:44:54.468 --> 06:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
level of reimbursement for us as a
 
06:44:56.388 --> 06:44:56.398 align:start position:0%
utility I think that's an important
 
06:44:58.628 --> 06:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
distinction to make for this
 
06:45:00.670 --> 06:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
group the other point I wanted to make
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
is since there's been a lot of talk
 
06:45:04.150 --> 06:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
about this idea of load settlement I
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
know that eversource referenced this but
 
06:45:08.868 --> 06:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
there is an active docket before the New
 
06:45:10.868 --> 06:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
06:45:13.350 --> 06:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
that is looking at all of these Concepts
 
06:45:15.110 --> 06:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
this idea of load settlement
 
06:45:17.230 --> 06:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
compensation for thirdparty net meter
 
06:45:19.830 --> 06:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
providers power generators I believe its
 
06:45:22.030 --> 06:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
number is
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
22660 and it's going to get underway in
 
06:45:28.070 --> 06:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh February of this year and all of
 
06:45:30.548 --> 06:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
these pieces are going to be reviewed as
 
06:45:33.388 --> 06:45:33.398 align:start position:0%
part of that docket and from Till's
 
06:45:35.110 --> 06:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
perspective that docket is the
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for all these
 
06:45:38.910 --> 06:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
conversations to
 
06:45:41.948 --> 06:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
occur finally the third question that uh
 
06:45:44.670 --> 06:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to raise was uh it has been
 
06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
asked a few times here will this
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
potential uh addition to the statute uh
 
06:45:53.628 --> 06:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
potentially hinder future projects on
 
06:45:57.070 --> 06:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of utilities uh from uni Till's
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
perspective being the utility that has
 
06:46:01.310 --> 06:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
gone through this project uh we're
 
06:46:02.670 --> 06:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this language and we're
 
06:46:04.590 --> 06:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
saying yes that is a
 
06:46:07.510 --> 06:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
possibility uh overall like we had said
 
06:46:09.830 --> 06:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
because there is this docket happening
 
06:46:12.350 --> 06:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
with uh the puc
 
06:46:16.110 --> 06:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
2260 uh a concern that one might have
 
06:46:18.230 --> 06:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be that adding this language to
 
06:46:20.388 --> 06:46:20.398 align:start position:0%
this particular docket would create a
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
situation where this issue could get
 
06:46:25.548 --> 06:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
relitigated over and over as part of all
 
06:46:27.628 --> 06:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
future proceedings when another project
 
06:46:30.670 --> 06:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
comes before again there is a path right
 
06:46:32.910 --> 06:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
now before the Pu to have this Con
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
concept of load generation be looked at
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh adding it to this statute as well
 
06:46:41.310 --> 06:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
could potentially mean that it gets you
 
06:46:42.990 --> 06:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
know if you if you don't like how that
 
06:46:44.430 --> 06:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
came out it could come up again and
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
again so I think it's important to raise
 
06:46:51.030 --> 06:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
that potential issue as well so overall
 
06:46:53.868 --> 06:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh wanted to had a hunch our solar array
 
06:46:55.590 --> 06:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
might come up today as part of this bill
 
06:46:58.430 --> 06:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
so wanted to come in and uh give you our
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
perspective on those pieces and answer
 
06:47:04.910 --> 06:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:07.190 --> 06:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Alec and I apologize for
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
mispronouncing your name as Alex that's
 
06:47:12.190 --> 06:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
quite all right I didn't look closely
 
06:47:14.708 --> 06:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
enough at your card to see that it was
 
06:47:17.788 --> 06:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
Alec so I have a question I think I
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
understood you to say that open dockets
 
06:47:23.670 --> 06:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
at the currently at the Pu on many of
 
06:47:26.388 --> 06:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
these subjects like load estimation and
 
06:47:29.270 --> 06:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
settlement processes and data sharing
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
Etc might make passing this legislation
 
06:47:34.948 --> 06:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
pre premature you did not indicate on
 
06:47:37.830 --> 06:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
your card though whether you support or
 
06:47:40.270 --> 06:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh oppose this legislation or are
 
06:47:42.830 --> 06:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
neutral yeah we are neutral on this
 
06:47:44.750 --> 06:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislation we came here from an
 
06:47:47.510 --> 06:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
educational perspective uh as we
 
06:47:49.388 --> 06:47:49.398 align:start position:0%
expected our solar array was likely
 
06:47:51.670 --> 06:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a topic of conversation here
 
06:47:52.830 --> 06:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
and we would have some points of
 
06:47:55.310 --> 06:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
clarification following testimony and
 
06:47:56.468 --> 06:47:56.478 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here and that's what
 
06:47:56.478 --> 06:47:57.388 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here and that's what
we're

06:47:57.388 --> 06:47:57.398 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:48:00.670 --> 06:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
saying perfect thank you representative
 
06:48:03.070 --> 06:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question thank Youk Tak
 
06:48:04.948 --> 06:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
my question as far as your project in
 
06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
Kingston goes is it uh accurate to state
 
06:48:09.388 --> 06:48:09.398 align:start position:0%
that you went through all this analysis
 
06:48:11.708 --> 06:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
on reduction of load and transmission
 
06:48:13.830 --> 06:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
cost and so forth and then those results
 
06:48:15.868 --> 06:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
were unique to that particular project
 
06:48:17.548 --> 06:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
at that location and wouldn't
 
06:48:19.868 --> 06:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily would apply to a different
 
06:48:22.468 --> 06:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
project 100 miles away I think it's
 
06:48:24.310 --> 06:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that location of a
 
06:48:26.070 --> 06:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
specific project would be a factor with
 
06:48:28.708 --> 06:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
any such development um going forward
 
06:48:30.388 --> 06:48:30.398 align:start position:0%
each individual project should probably
 
06:48:32.310 --> 06:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
be looked at at a case-by case basis I
 
06:48:34.628 --> 06:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
think that's a prudent approach for any
 
06:48:36.670 --> 06:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
distribution project thank
 
06:48:39.628 --> 06:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
06:48:41.910 --> 06:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:48:42.990 --> 06:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
06:48:43.000 --> 06:48:44.548 align:start position:0%
you Mr
Amira

06:48:44.548 --> 06:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
Amira
 
06:48:47.190 --> 06:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry but I was a little unclear
 
06:48:49.910 --> 06:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
on on how it would be that this bill
 
06:48:52.350 --> 06:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
could have projects being relitigated
 
06:48:53.868 --> 06:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
can you go into that in a little more
 
06:48:56.510 --> 06:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
detail what what what the steps would be
 
06:48:58.468 --> 06:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
why that would happen yeah absolutely
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
and to be fair we found the language in
 
06:49:03.150 --> 06:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
the statute a bit Broad we're just
 
06:49:05.190 --> 06:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that it appears to have a
 
06:49:07.388 --> 06:49:07.398 align:start position:0%
lot of parallels with an active docket
 
06:49:10.948 --> 06:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
before the Pu right now so in looking at
 
06:49:14.190 --> 06:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
that uh adding specific language to this
 
06:49:16.468 --> 06:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
particular docket could create the
 
06:49:19.030 --> 06:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
potential where these topics then get
 
06:49:21.708 --> 06:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
reviewed on a repeated basis as opposed
 
06:49:23.430 --> 06:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
to in a separate docket which then has
 
06:49:25.948 --> 06:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
an order and declares what that process
 
06:49:28.230 --> 06:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
would be going forward a docket has an
 
06:49:30.388 --> 06:49:30.398 align:start position:0%
end point a statute can be reviewed in
 
06:49:30.398 --> 06:49:34.030 align:start position:0%
end point a statute can be reviewed in
perpetuity

06:49:34.030 --> 06:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:37.788 --> 06:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none it looks like
 
06:49:43.150 --> 06:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're done thank you uh Mr Oma for being
 
06:49:46.670 --> 06:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
here is there anyone in the audience who
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
would like to make a comment or give
 
06:49:52.110 --> 06:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
some brief testimony who' forgot to
 
06:49:53.990 --> 06:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
submit a pck
 
06:49:56.670 --> 06:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
card okay seeing none I guess we're done
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we're going to close the public
 
06:50:02.070 --> 06:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 406 FN and that
 
06:50:04.510 --> 06:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much concludes our business for
 
06:50:07.388 --> 06:50:07.398 align:start position:0%
today I will remind members that we will
 
06:50:10.750 --> 06:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
start a executive session on three bills
 
06:50:13.468 --> 06:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning promptly at
 
06:50:16.388 --> 06:50:16.398 align:start position:0%
9:00 and after that we'll have public
 
06:50:20.270 --> 06:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
hearings on four additional bills over
 
06:50:22.350 --> 06:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
the course of the rest of the day so
 
06:50:23.868 --> 06:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work today and we'll
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
see you all tomorrow excuse me Mr chair
 
06:50:29.670 --> 06:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
