contact information to dhhs
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
section 2 removes the current
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that a health officer be a
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
state resident
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is a request of several towns and
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
this requirement has been
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%

draft templates are in development and
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that matt callahan
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
from dhhs will be here to share them
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%

to be the health officer for several
towns

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
section 6 adds training of health
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
officers by dhhs
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
background checks and rulemaking most
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
importantly regarding new hampshire's
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
readiness for the next pandemic
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement for the health
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
officers association
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
to report to the hhs oversight committee
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
and the state health assessment and
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
state health improvement plan advisory
 
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
state health improvement plan advisory
council

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
section 7 gives health officers the new
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
duty to communicate with the
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner about non-compliance with
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine and enforcement orders
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
it also gives health officers
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority in the event of a
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
the same enforcement authority extended
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
to health officers
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
by provision 5 of emergency order 65.
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
i believe these provisions need to be in
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
statute to enable lifting the current
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
section 8 allows data sharing between
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
health officers and dhhs
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
thereby enabling health officers to
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
inform local officials
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
when actions are advisable to protect
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
in my town this would have been
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
when we had a sudden outbreak of kovitz
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
shortly after the november election
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to make our public
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
health system into a true
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
system where local officials can work
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
together with state officials
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
section 9 requires des to provide a copy
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
of notices closing pools to local health
 
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.990 align:start position:0%
of notices closing pools to local health
officers

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
a request of the littleton health
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
officer the contact information in
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
section 1
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
will allow this to happen without
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
burdening des
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
i thank you for consideration i will be
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
glad to take questions
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from those on
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you would like to raise your hand
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
electronically you can do that
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you're on the phone you can raise
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair looks like the first hand raise
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
was from representative porter
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative please go ahead
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
for presenting the bill i only have one
 
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
for presenting the bill i only have one
question

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes the health officer
 
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes the health officer
to

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
appoint a deputy health officer the bill
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
also talks about the health office
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
requiring training but it doesn't
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
mention whether the
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
deputy health officer also requires that
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
training and i'm wondering if that was
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
your intention uh
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative porter i
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it might be appropriate
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
for deputy health officers to have
 
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.870 align:start position:0%
for deputy health officers to have
training

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
we put in a requirement for health
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
officers to have training which is a new
 
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.669 align:start position:0%
officers to have training which is a new
requirement

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to overreach certainly
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable for the deputy
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
health officers to have that training as
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
frequently deputy health officers become
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
health officers
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
but we figured this was one step at a
 
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.669 align:start position:0%
but we figured this was one step at a
time

00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative marsha do you have uh
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony in writing that we could
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
get a hold of i will be glad to email it
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and next we have
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh angie poody as her
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
hand up yes
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr t thank you representative
 
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr t thank you representative
marsh

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
my question to you is having these
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
changes existed have
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
had these changes existed in the books
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
would our approach to pandemic covert 19
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
would be
helpful

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
the short answer to that is yes the
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
longer answer is more complicated as you
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
know i've served on the governor's
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
economic reopening task force
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
we had quite some debate over the summer
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
as to whether health officers should
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
have enforcement authority or not
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
and at the beginning of the summer at
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
least health officers were in the
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
position where they could persuade
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
and educate which was really the
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate first step
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
but if enforcement was needed someone
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
else had to be called in and the initial
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
idea was to call on the liquor
 
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
idea was to call on the liquor
commission

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
by the end of the summer it was decided
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the governor needed to give
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority to health officers
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
and he did so by emergency order
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the process would have been
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
smoother had we done that from the very
 
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
smoother had we done that from the very
beginning

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
but uh as fact of the matter i think we
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
have created our solution as we've gone
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
along and done a pretty good job here in
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have a representative
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
trip and then we'll go to representative
 
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.549 align:start position:0%
trip and then we'll go to representative
fieldman

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
fieldman
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question is a
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up to uh
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative porter's on the deputy
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
health officer
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh what exactly is the deputy health
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
officer's uh duties if it's not uh
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
identical to the health officer
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
the deputy health officer in towns that
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
have one i don't have one in my town
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh would be to assist the health officer
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
in whatever way the health officer
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
requests just like the the vice chair
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
helps the chair in your committee
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think it may vary greatly between
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
so the uh follow-up please so the
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
healthy health officer really has no
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh defined duties or responsible
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
that is correct they do not have
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
independent authority
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you then next up we have
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.430 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
question

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
um i was just wondering if um
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
you see the health officer as an
 
00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
you see the health officer as an
independent

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
department without as a department head
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
without oversight from
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
anyone but the select board or town
 
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.590 align:start position:0%
anyone but the select board or town
manager

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
administration uh well the way the law
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
is established the
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
health officers are actually appointed
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner of health and human
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
services at the recommendation of the
 
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
services at the recommendation of the
selectmen

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
so in that sense the the health officer
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
reports to the commissioner but the
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
health officer
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
i won't say works because in some towns
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
such as my town the health officer is a
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer but but the health officer
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
certainly reports to the selectmen
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps not as frequently as they ought
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
establish that happen more frequently in
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the spill by requiring annual
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
meetings at least
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i see uh representative andrew
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
cootie's hand
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
up is that it has been lowered or does
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
she have another question
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
no sorry that was a mistake i didn't
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
roll over
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative mark for taking my
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
question my question
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
is with uh with regard to the background
 
00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:39.669 align:start position:0%
is with uh with regard to the background
check

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
um i presume there will be some nominal
 
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.750 align:start position:0%
um i presume there will be some nominal
fee

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
that the town is going to have to incur
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
for that background check um and that
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if if that's true i
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
assume that is true
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
and do you do you recognize any problem
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
if the um if the
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen is acting as the
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
health officer
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
just two separate questions i apologize
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
i'll answer the second one first i know
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
of a number of towns where a member of
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
the board of selectmen
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
acts as the health officer and i'm not
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
aware of any problems with that
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
as far as requiring a background check
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
is concerned it is my understanding that
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
there is a nominal fee for that process
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
however i do believe that it is
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
important that if we give
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority to health officers
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
that they have a background check
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um despite the fact that that was not a
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
part of the emergency order that was put
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
in place this summer
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh do we do we have a a member of dhhs
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
on the line that would like to speak
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
i believe we do mr chair and i've
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
allowed i believe i've allowed that
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
person to
 
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
person to

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%

i'm pleased to have the opportunity to
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
provide this testimony today on bill
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 79 dhhs has worked with
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative marsh during the process
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
of developing the language for this bill
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're supportive of the bill and we
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
believe the proposed changes will assist
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
health officers in their charge of
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
protecting local public health
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh did an excellent
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
job reviewing that in section one
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
he talked about many other suggested
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
changes and the proposed legislation
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
would affect rsa 128
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
should be noted that these items apply
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire towns and not to cities
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
the bill will require local board of
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
health to meet once per year to review
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
public health threats and readiness to
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
respond to them this provision will
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
allow the department to better
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand the types of public health
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
threats and readiness
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire communities public
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
health threats can include chemical
 
00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
health threats can include chemical
disease

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
sanitary conditions in housing pests or
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
road infestations
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
health nuisances in the form of waste
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
noise or odors and hoarding of
 
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
noise or odors and hoarding of
possessions

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
possessions
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
or animals another provision the bill
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
requires the health officers and deputy
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
health officers share the same
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
appointment officer term and we believe
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
this allows for more flexibility
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to find and nominate
 
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.029 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to find and nominate
them

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
we also believe that removing the
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
residency requirement will allow
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
communities more opportunity with
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
recruitment and expand the pool of
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
during the past year covent 19 response
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
has provided many lessons on how to best
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
address threats and manage the public
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
health emergencies at the state and
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
local level
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
dhhs has used the best available
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
information to create a guidance
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that has both met public health
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
standards and allowed flexibility for
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
both business
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the public sector in an effort to
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
inform local officials
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
about coven 19 guidelines dhhs health

listserv messages
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
and directed two dozen training webinars
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
on the spread prevention
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
and treatment of the disease as we
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
continue to work
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
to reopen the economy the hhs will rely
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
heavily on local
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
local health officers to inform
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
community members of the public
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
about public health guidance respond to
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
complaints and pursue compliance in
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
collaboration with state agencies
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
as part of the response to the covenant
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
19 pandemic dhhs identified some areas
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
for improvement in further collaboration
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
with local health authorities
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of the gaps identified included the
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
need to improve communication
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
clarify local public health readiness
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
and support basic training for health
 
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
and support basic training for health
officers

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
in conclusion dhhs acknowledges that the
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
changes included in the bill
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
will provide greater flexibility for
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
local government to nominate health
 
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.310 align:start position:0%

officers
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
improve the ability of health officers
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
to fulfill their duties under specific
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
state laws

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
your last name correctly
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay helene hey helene thank you for
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick question you
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this covers towns not
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
cities can you tell me why
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
under rsa 128 the legislature set that
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
up to apply to
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
to town specifically not to cities
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason we don't have the
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
authority under 128 to cover cities we
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
obviously collaborate with them very
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
well but
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
just doesn't cover that section got it
 
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.789 align:start position:0%
just doesn't cover that section got it
thanks

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions are
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
there any members of the public that
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
i do not see any hands raised all right
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
saying none i'm going to close the
 
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.789 align:start position:0%
saying none i'm going to close the

hearing
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
well i do see a couple of hands have
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
come up but i'm not sure if they're for
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
2002 i am also the vice president
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire health office
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
association and i just wanted to support
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative marsh and matt uh with
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
their testimony
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh we worked together on this and we
 
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
uh we worked together on this and we
really

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support of representative
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
they went over all the uh the issues uh
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to sort of emphasize
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of them um right now there are
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
no training requirements for health
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
officers and we think
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
um you know this is kind of starting out
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
with a basic three hour
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh requirement we think that's a great
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction to make sure
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
that we have a
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
a trained and competent
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
health officer in new hampshire for each
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
each town
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
the communication the disease reporting
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
i think is also very important and that
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
was very apparent during this pandemic
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
with a variety of issues and i know one
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the representatives asked
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
um would this have helped having these
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
new requirements and it sure would
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
um you know we're responsible for
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
providing information to our residents
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're involved in in trying to deal with
 
00:33:07.679 --> 00:33:08.950 align:start position:0%
we're involved in in trying to deal with
isolation

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
and quarantine requirements
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
however health officers are not notified
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
of any covet positive cases that
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
is is not shared with the local health
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
officers so
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
we get questions we get calls
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
from businesses asking how do they
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
respond how do they deal with
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh a positive employee for covid um
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best we can but i think
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the sharing
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
of that information that disease
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
reporting would help
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh all of us um to deal with this
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
pandemic a little better and
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're partners with the state
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
we want to work with them and i think
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.050 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question is
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
to matthew galhin
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh did i say a last name right
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
helene right okay helene
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
um is there something similar existing
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
for cities that
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
had provided that platform during the
 
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.909 align:start position:0%
had provided that platform during the
pandemic

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know as you probably likely know
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
most of the cities in new hampshire have
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
independent health departments certainly
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua did a very good
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
job of managing
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the tracking of covid cases and
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
all health officers and have done a good
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
job with the rollout of a vaccine in
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
but um due to clarify
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the first part of the of this bill um
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
that covers rsa 128 covers
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
towns and not cities the second part for
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 141
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
would cover towns and cities allowing
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
sharing of information and that the
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
third part um which was
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think rsa 45 for the reporting of
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes 45 for the regulation pools and
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
bathing places i believe would cover
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
both towns
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
and cities so it's a little different
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's different as the
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the uh
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
for those giving testimony mr chief of
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
mr trump
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh representative klee has hurt
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
hand raised and we also have nate graves
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
from nhma who has his hand raised
 
00:35:56.839 --> 00:35:58.870 align:start position:0%
from nhma who has his hand raised
representative

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much um and
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
my question may have already been
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
answered through representative
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
manjapudi's uh
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure how to word this when
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
it comes to the
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
the reporting are we saying
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
the um dhhs would report to the local
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
health officer or in this particular
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
case or the um
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
the city's department of health and
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm a little just confused as to
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
who's reporting
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
that question is for mr uh caroline
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
great am i unmuted yet yeah you're doing
 
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.550 align:start position:0%
great am i unmuted yet yeah you're doing
fine

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
great okay um so um
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
just sorry i got distracted for a second
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
um there are two
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
um requirements um for assessing uh
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
threats at the local level in the state
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
level it's not a reporting requirement
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
as much as
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
ability to share information between the
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
under um section three town health

provide or we'd like to provide
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility here so the town can report
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
as requested by us
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
information on them and you might be
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
you know the the during summer times
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's often um
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that's one information
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
where we want improved information
 
00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
where we want improved information
sharing

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
and if there was say an outbreak or
 
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.069 align:start position:0%
and if there was say an outbreak or
excessive

00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
bed bugs that were moving from dwellings
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
to the library which happens often or to
 
00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
to the library which happens often or to
schools

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'd like to share that information and
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
have the town understand how to manage
 
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.589 align:start position:0%
have the town understand how to manage
that

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
and how to understand the hazards they
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
have so that's kind of the first element
 
00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
have so that's kind of the first element
right

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
the local level reporting to and sharing
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
information with the the state level
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
dhhs so we can better help them
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a second part about a
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
so this says on hb 79 line 28
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
this is section six and i believe it's
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
page two sorry it says beginning um
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
november 1st 2021 and annually
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health officer
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
association in consultation with dhhs
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
shall report to the joint legislative
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
hhs established under rsa 126
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
and the state health assessment and
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
state health improvement plan advisory
 
00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.390 align:start position:0%
state health improvement plan advisory
council

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the readiness of municipal
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
health officers to respond to potential
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
public health threats in new hampshire
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
so as brian lockhart was just saying as
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
a representative of the health office
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
association the idea with the
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
state work with dhhs gather information
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
from the locals right which is now
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
flowing up
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
and be able to report that to
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislature so they understand both the
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
public health threats and the readiness
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the local health department to be
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
any uh last questions from the public
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
let's take one more
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
if there's one more uh question out
 
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.190 align:start position:0%
if there's one more uh question out
there

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh the last one mr chairs from h graves
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
please go right ahead good morning mr
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
chair and i
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
apologize i thought i had signed up
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
successfully on friday but i guess not
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
to testify on this
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
as well as hb 332 and hb
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
404. um in any case we are in support
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill i won't reiterate the
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that has already been given
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
today i think that was excellent
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh we agree with with all of those
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
points um
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would add is that
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
probably the number one health related
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic related issue that we've
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.349 align:start position:0%
pandemic related issue that we've
received

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh questions about at nhma have been
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
that ability to communicate between the
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
local health officers and the state
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of frustration
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
especially over the summer about
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
how that was being done we think this
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill would address
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
those issues and assist local health
 
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.630 align:start position:0%
those issues and assist local health
officers

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the state build a stronger
 
00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:25.990 align:start position:0%
and the state build a stronger
relationship

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
and have a better free flow of
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
information that will help everyone
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
so we can we can get this pandemic under
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
control as well as any other issues
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from mr graves
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you mr grace this
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
addressed by mr k helene um
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
my question was about the um
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
effective date and 60 days after passage
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
are we grandfathering in the existing
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
or current health officers or they all
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to go through
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
training and background checks after
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would defer to dhhs on on how they
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
applying that portion of the law
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none i'm going to
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
next up is house bill 88 relative to the
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
city of clermont
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
police commission i believe we have
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative stapleton that would
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%

this bill is which is
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
hb 88 is a housekeeping bill
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it basically changes one word in the
 
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
and it basically changes one word in the
bill

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
complexity relative uh to uh
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
the town's history in this regard uh
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%

over time in 1963 and 1971
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
in 1973 where various parts of the law

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.349 align:start position:0%
remaining here to um where the city
manager

00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
was um making the decision
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the police commission and
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh it rightfully should be with uh
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
reside with the city council
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
now in 192019 um
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
the city adopted uh the ordinance
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's now ordinance number 570
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
to rectify this as far as we're
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
concerned on a local basis
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
but because it was a matter of statute
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
we needed to have it cleaned up
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
so we're calling the the ordinance
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
coincides with
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh correct statute mandate
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
pence we we strive to
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
um in bill 88 to change
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
the appointment of the police commission
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the city manager to the city
 
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
from the city manager to the city
council

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
now the city manager still becomes a
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
member of the police commission
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
and is a ex-officio for advice
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
and guidance and recommendations and so
 
00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:41.430 align:start position:0%
and guidance and recommendations and so
forth

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
but not the decision maker as to the
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
appointment of the three police
 
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.550 align:start position:0%
appointment of the three police
commissioners

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the city and so we're asking
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
that um the committee consider passing
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
hp 88 so that we can rectify this
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
and make this housekeeping measure
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
permanent um
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
to go forward and have the city council
 
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.309 align:start position:0%
to go forward and have the city council
authority

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh for appointment instead of just only
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
the city manager
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh and that concludes uh my presentation
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
i was welcome to questions on that
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
i was welcome to questions on that
better

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
before we go to questions representative
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.990 align:start position:0%

to remember that we this was a bill that
 
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
to remember that we this was a bill that
we

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%

no sorry i forgot to lower my hand i
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll hear from
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative o'vern
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry good yep
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%

good morning i'm representative andrew
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
o'hearn uh sullivan
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
three ward one clam on good morning mr
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
chair and fellow representatives
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously representative stapleton
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill it is exactly what it was last year
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
in 1443
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
the only correction i think i would make
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
council will appoint the police
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
commission but i don't believe
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh if i remember right that the city
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
manager will be part of the
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
police commission it would just be the
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
three members
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh without the city manager but i'll
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you have any
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh representative clutier
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%

on house bill 88
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have a procedural quest
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
question for you if that's all right
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead um i'm uh
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of a bill we're hearing
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
this after a little while
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
but i did not sign up online to
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
um present the bill to the committee do
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
do i need to do that online for the
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
bills that i'm the sponsor of and i
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be introducing
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
or do you automatically call the person
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
who's introducing the bill
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
well that's my practice but i don't
 
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.069 align:start position:0%
well that's my practice but i don't
think

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
i can speak for the chair of the
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee that you'll be addressing i
 
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
committee that you'll be addressing i
would

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
no this this is for this committee today
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
i mean a little while if 383 i didn't
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
sign up to
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
i just didn't think i had to do that but
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm still learning
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
we all uh so i'm gonna
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
take this next couple of minutes before
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
we start the next hearing give a little
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
public announcement you probably
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
i would encourage certainly your own
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
all our fellow members to vaccinate if
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can i was vaccinated this week with
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the modern
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
version of the vaccine i had no side
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
effects but i'm told the second
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
shot may give me a case of the man flu
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
which i will
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
i will completely uh um
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
exploit into chicken soup and probably a
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
hot fudge sundae
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
to help me through it but i would i
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
would encourage
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
people to consider uh based on your
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
on good science and whatever your
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
current health condition is whether or
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
not you
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to get the shot the other thing i
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to you about
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
is just a reminder of
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
our mask policy while in the building
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
most of you aren't here today but so you
 
00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:06.710 align:start position:0%
most of you aren't here today but so you
might

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
you might not be used to the mass policy
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
if you do come to the lob
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
that there are three ways it's strictly
 
00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.109 align:start position:0%
that there are three ways it's strictly
enforced

00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
and violent violators of the mass policy
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
will be reported or can be reported to
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
and there's three primary violations
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we are looking for to keep us
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
all safe one is that if you're in your
 
00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
all safe one is that if you're in your
seat

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
like i am right now you can take your
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
mask off you'll see that most of the
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
time i have mine on anyway
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
but that's the only time it's a
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
violation if you get up out of your seat
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
and move about without your mask on
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
also if you're within six feet of
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
another person
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
without your mask on that's a that's a
 
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
without your mask on that's a that's a
violation

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
and thirdly if you go to a common area
 
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.069 align:start position:0%
and thirdly if you go to a common area
like

00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
a hallway or a restroom or stairway
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
you must wear your mask having you mask
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
off in that area is also a violation and
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
is affordable to the speaker's office
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
so it's strictly enforced not to be
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
overly punitive but to protect the
 
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.030 align:start position:0%
overly punitive but to protect the
safety

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
of each other as we navigate through
 
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:22.870 align:start position:0%
of each other as we navigate through
this

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
terrible pandemic hopefully the light at
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
the end of the tunnel is coming
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
but please be safe also
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we have another session just
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%

the the i.t individual i didn't catch
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
his name when he came in he was
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
very quick to troubleshoot and i guess i
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
was the problem
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what he did to my computer
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:05.750 align:start position:0%

another like look like it was last night
 
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.390 align:start position:0%
another like look like it was last night
another

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
two to four
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
another batch yeah so
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're making up for january i know that
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
the people on derry are complaining
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
about the public works
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency you know you have the same
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
problem in london
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we have uh actually
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
but by for the state and um we have a
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
lot of state roads
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
as dairy does to come through the state
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
of the regular job
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
but our biggest problem usually tends to
 
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
but our biggest problem usually tends to
be

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
ice storms we have hilly roads
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
and if they get icy you know get salt on
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
well i came back yesterday from antrim
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i only saw one car off the road
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
until i got into london
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
and then i had saw four oh wow so
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things very rough
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
obviously the roads are a little slicker
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
in london
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%

person under the age of 18.
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
i have submitted this bill not because
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a large number of
 
00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:51.270 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a large number of
cities

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
cities
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
sending their health departments to
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
break up children's lemonade stands
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
in fact i do not know of any towns in
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
shutting down lemonade stands of
 
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.030 align:start position:0%
shutting down lemonade stands of
children

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
the goal of hb 183 is to ensure that
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
lemonade stands of children in new
 
00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:09.349 align:start position:0%
lemonade stands of children in new
hampshire

00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
will not ever be shut down by any town
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
please know that i included lemonade
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
only lemonade stands in the bill because
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
i wanted to keep it as simple as
 
00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:21.670 align:start position:0%
i wanted to keep it as simple as
possible

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
hb 183 is now in the possession of the
 
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.710 align:start position:0%
hb 183 is now in the possession of the
committee

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
and it is certainly your decision as to
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
whether you wish to also include
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill kool-aid xylax physies or
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
any other terminology that the committee
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
feels is best
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a dylan's rule state
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
and thus new hampshire defines
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
what it will grant to the local
 
00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:46.309 align:start position:0%
what it will grant to the local
governments

00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
hb 183 clearly states that the new
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire towns will not have the
 
00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire towns will not have the
authority

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
to license and regulate lemonade stands
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
of children
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
i hope that the committee agrees that
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
there is not any need
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire to grant
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
to a local government
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to control and regulate
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
children's lemonade stands
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.109 align:start position:0%

uh from the committee uh for
representative

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher has his
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
you said you can't think of any examples
 
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
you said you can't think of any examples
of

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
cities that have already
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
tried to shut down lemon lemonade stands
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
then may i ask
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
what exactly was it that inspired
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
this bill like what why might
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
it even become an issue in the future
 
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
it even become an issue in the future
that

01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh why that a city might want to shut
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
down a lemonade stand
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
officer legislative services could not
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
find any instances in new hampshire
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
they have found many instances of
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
health departments or towns sending
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
their police forces
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
there was even a case i believe it was a
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
lemonade manufacturer
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
who pledged something like ten thousand
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to defend children
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
who uh who were fined
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
for operating without a permit or a
 
01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:52.549 align:start position:0%
for operating without a permit or a
license

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
that just seems far
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
far too overboard too heavy-handed
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
and it's those actions that that's why
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
i've introduced the bill
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
so such actions do not happen in new
 
01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.829 align:start position:0%
so such actions do not happen in new
hampshire

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay for representative manchapudi
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
because i think i'm going to anticipate
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
the question you're going to ask
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
this bill uh of the people that signed
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
in report
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
are supporting it nine support one
 
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.349 align:start position:0%
are supporting it nine support one
opposed

01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
did you have any other comments that you
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to unmute
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
i do i do have a question for uh
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
so you know i i am glad
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is not in existence in new
 
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.430 align:start position:0%
this is not in existence in new
hampshire

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
having two kids in my neighborhood
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
kids having lemonade which i encouraged
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
and supported
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
and they did well uh knowing that i
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
didn't violate i'm happy
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
but by stating
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
that this is not an issue in new
 
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.349 align:start position:0%
that this is not an issue in new
hampshire

01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
but yet you're trying to prevent
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
um do you think that is
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
making or shining the spotlight on this
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
issue so it would become an issue or
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
is it i'm just trying to figure out
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
why you why
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
has uh has uh ordinances
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
where they require uh peddlers
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
and hawkers of wares as such to uh to
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
apply for a permit
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
to uh for a day
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i believe it was something like fifty
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
dollars a day that they would have to
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
if nashua decided that they had
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
a uh a need
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
to cease all children's lemonade stands
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
they could use that ordinance to uh to
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
call for
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh a 50 permit to be issued
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
for a kid to run a lemonade stand where
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
and because we are a dylan rule state
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
knowing that a city could do this if
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
they so
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
chose to my position is
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the new hampshire
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
way for
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
a health department to go and shut down
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
a kid's lemonade stand or kool-aid stand
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
next up we have representative porter
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to representative
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
state thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.309 align:start position:0%
state thank you mr chair and thank you
representative

01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically says that any
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
a lemonade stand operated by a person
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18.
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
so if i were a 25 year old and i wanted
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
to set up a stand
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
to make money but i didn't want to spend
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars for a license
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
my town required could i then hire
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old to run the stand for me
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
operate the stand for me so that it
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get shut down
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
under under the terms of this bill
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
um yes i guess if
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
if you owned a home in nashua
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
and you wanted to hire a 17 year old kid
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
to sit out in your front lawn
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
sell lemonade um
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
you could do that i can't imagine why
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
somebody would hire
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
somebody to sit on their lawn to sell
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
lemonade but
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
yes you you could hire a 17 year old
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
i guess in the hopes that he would make
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
more than two or three dollars a day
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
selling lemonade
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
reporter you had a follow-up yes i do
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
because i'm a little puzzled by this in
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
hillsborough um we often have a balloon
 
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.430 align:start position:0%
hillsborough um we often have a balloon
festival

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
festival
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
um and one of the most uh
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
visited stands at the balloon festival
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
is the lemonade fresh lemonade stand
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
where the person is mixing
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
the sugar water in the lemons right in
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
front of you and they charge 3.50 cents
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
to five dollars
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
for a glass of lemonade um that
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't a stand in front of my
 
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.029 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't a stand in front of my
house

01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
but under the provision of this bill
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand not be able to be shut
 
01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand not be able to be shut
down

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
um i'm not familiar with
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you i'm sorry sir i'm not
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with your area of new hampshire
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
your town would charge a
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
peddler or a hawker to set up a lemonade
 
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
peddler or a hawker to set up a lemonade
stand

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
stand
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
i guess it all depends on on how much
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
money you thought you could make uh
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
setting up
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
a lemonade stand for for a day or
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
or however long you wanted to set it up
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
i am in no way talking about uh
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
extreme situations where somebody is
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
going to try to save himself a
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the permit is a a ten
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
dollar permit
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
where he would have to hire somebody
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
a teenager pay them something um
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's not the situation that i
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
envisioned at all i envisioned
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
children like i did when i was a child
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
setting uh a table out and uh and
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
selling uh selling
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
lemonade to uh people in my neighborhood
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
who happened to walk by
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
next we'll go to representatives davis
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
have representative mcdonald and
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative drew for taking my
 
01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.070 align:start position:0%
representative drew for taking my
question

01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
um under this bill if i
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
were a child and i wanted to have a bake
 
01:08:52.239 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
were a child and i wanted to have a bake
sale

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
would that also be um
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
exempt from any prohibition from the
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
town or is it
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
is it specific to lemonade and if it's
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
specific to lemonade
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
why thank you thank you for the question
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
um yes it is specific to lemonade
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
and as i said before the reason i made
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
it specifically for lemonade
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
is because i'm not trying to get
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
children to sell clothing
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
or baked goods
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
all i want a child to be able to do in
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
is set up a table in front of their
 
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.309 align:start position:0%
is set up a table in front of their
house

01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
and sell lemonade that that's why i only
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
made it lemonade i wanted to keep the
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
bill as clean
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
i have experience and i did a lot of the
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
stuff when i was 10k and i was just
 
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:15.030 align:start position:0%
stuff when i was 10k and i was just
graduating

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
setting up lemonade stands at their home
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
why not make it a little bit younger
 
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
why not make it a little bit younger
like

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
13 you know under or something like that
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
where they would be working at it but
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
also setting a stand up front
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
on their phone thank you for the
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
question as i said i mean
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is no longer mine it is in in
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
your hands and you can certainly i would
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
not object to that
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
the reason i chose under 18
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
is because that is a child at 18 you're
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
an adult
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire under 18 that that's
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
why that's why i chose
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
that particular age i would certainly
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
have no objection
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever age they felt was more
 
01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.709 align:start position:0%
for whatever age they felt was more
appropriate

01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
i just picked under 18 because
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
you were still a child
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative true uh my question is
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
statute originally is enabling and
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
towns and our towns can make a decision
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
on what they want to
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
regulate as far as hawkers and vendors
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
on the streets so
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
that would make this lemonade
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue still a town issue town to town
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
issue is that correct
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
if if this would have become law
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes towns would still have
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances regulating hawkers and
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
federers and all that
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
but obviously what they could not have
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that a ten-year-old
 
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.630 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that a ten-year-old
child

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
get a 50 permit to sell lemonade
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's what they would not be able to do
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
they would still still be able to
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
to regulate other businesses in their
 
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.950 align:start position:0%
to regulate other businesses in their
town

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
right sorry i missed the word prohibited
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else perhaps
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
from the public that would like to
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
a very similar bill came to this
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and while it was
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
actively considered i believe that the
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
build was not supported
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
primarily for a um
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
or what i would call a minor reason and
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh we get caught up in the issue of why
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
just lemonade
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
what if what if the child wanted to sell
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
a glass of water or coca-cola
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
or kool-aid uh why
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
why would we just single out lemonade so
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to exact this bill tomorrow
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon and they're
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
prepared an amendment that you all
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of that
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
that executes a minor change
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill where it calls out lemonade
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment just changes that to soft
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
drinks so if someone wants to sell
 
01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
drinks so if someone wants to sell
kool-aid

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
kool-aid
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
orange juice or whatever water
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh it would all be uh i'll be
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
captured under this bill so that's
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's coming tomorrow
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
still here i don't have any other anyone
 
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
still here i don't have any other anyone
else

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's asked to speak and in deference
 
01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
that's asked to speak and in deference
to

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi this is
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
supported nine to one for those who have
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh oh we do have a representative van
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
has as a question yes please go ahead
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman nolan dolan uh
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
this is actually a question for
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
um correct me if i'm wrong but
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
since we are a dylan's rule state and
 
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
since we are a dylan's rule state and
since

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
cities and towns already have the
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
regulate hawkers and peddlers
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear why we need to single out
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
children's lemonade stands
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
as a thing that has to be dealt with in
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
a particular way
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there is a uh
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
there is a history of little kids
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
for to get some pocket money
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
um i think any uh
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
any effort to regulate that with a
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar pedaller's fee is
 
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar pedaller's fee is
overhanded

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
overhanded
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's just too heavy-handed
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
um right now as a i believe
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
a town could say we will only allow
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
a kid to sell lemonade on the front lawn
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
this being a dillon state
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
would say no you can't
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would take away that that authority
 
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.470 align:start position:0%
we would take away that that authority
from

01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh from the cities and towns to say
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
to sell lemonade in our town uh a
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
ten-year-old must pay a fifty or a
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
headless fee they would know what if
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
this passes they would no longer have
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
that authority to do that
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
the state would take away that authority
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh has any town
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
enforced or threaten to enforce
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
or put on the books any such
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance i i'm just trying to determine
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
how pressing this
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
is i asked
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
ols to do research for me and they could
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
not find
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
any instance in new hampshire where this
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
has happened yet
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
they found many instances throughout the
 
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
they found many instances throughout the
country

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
where in some cases children were
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
fined for violating a city ordinance
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
that is what i am trying to avoid ever
 
01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
that is what i am trying to avoid ever
happening

01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire because i don't
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
see that as being
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to being the new
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire way
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%

01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
briefly just to get into the terms
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
the development of regional impact is a
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
way within the rsas for regional
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
planning that a planning board can
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that a project
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
impacts other communities outside of its
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
own jurisdiction
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
so if a planning board determines that
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
an application
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
is a dri then the affected communities
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
plus the regional planning commission
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
which is appropriate will be notified as
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
a butters for the plan
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
um when you do this there's some
 
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
um when you do this there's some
specific

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
overhead uh administrative it's
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
specified in the
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the rsa and that will end up delaying
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
when the application gets worked on
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
typically it's for
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
one meeting cycle to explain why i think
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think it'll be fastest just to
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
go through my own experience with this i
 
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
go through my own experience with this i
am

01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
am
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
also wearing a different hat the chair
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
of my town's planning board
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we had an experience uh it happened
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the fall of 2019
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
um an application came in we were
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
actually familiar with it we
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
we knew the property we knew the
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
developer they had had a previous
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
application on this
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so we knew that it was going to be a
 
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
and so we knew that it was going to be a
dri

01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
dri
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the applicant was of course eager to
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
expedite things they asked us if there
 
01:31:02.639 --> 01:31:03.189 align:start position:0%
expedite things they asked us if there
were

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
any shortcuts to the process um
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
our town's planner ended up putting a
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
lot of time in
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
having a lot of discussion we worked
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
through legal
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
i spent some time reviewing the rsas and
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately we decided we had to follow
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
as the rsas required it so what happened
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
we met
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
um it was right after thanksgiving 2019
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting we accepted the
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
application is complete
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
a regional impact
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
which then sent motion the process for
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
notification for that um
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
now our planning board we review
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
applications monthly
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the fourth week of each month
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
with one exception
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
in december every year because of the
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
christmas holiday
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
we move our meeting forward so what
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
happened was there was no way
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
for us to continue that meeting from
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
november to the december meeting
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
because the deadlines didn't allow it
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
so we continued to january you all had a
 
01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:11.990 align:start position:0%
so we continued to january you all had a
merry

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
merry
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
christmas happy new year came back in
 
01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
christmas happy new year came back in
january

01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
um opened the hearing on the process now
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
with the regional impact notification
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
having gone
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
out and well the first thing we had to
 
01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:26.709 align:start position:0%
out and well the first thing we had to
discuss

01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
was that the 65-day requirement
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
for a planning board to complete review
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
on an application and make a decision
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
was now due to expire within the week
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
so our discussion was well is the
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
applicant uh willing to extend the time
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
for review
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
um to make a long story short it just
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it set a bad tone for the application
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
and we spent a good
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
chunk of that first month's hearing
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
discussing issues around around the
 
01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
discussing issues around around the
delay

01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
so putting on my other hat as i
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
explained to the planning board why we
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
got into this and why the law required
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
doing what we did i offered um
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
to come up with a bill come up with some
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
legislation that would address this
 
01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:24.070 align:start position:0%
legislation that would address this
problem

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think if this bill's enacted it would
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
simply automatically do what's going to
 
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
simply automatically do what's going to
happen

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
anyway through the process that's
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
outlined in the rsas
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i think it'll simply smooth the
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
process along all around
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that the applicant the board
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
and everyone spends less time
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
on compliance with the rsa and more time
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing the application
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
um so with that again i'll thank you for
 
01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.229 align:start position:0%
um so with that again i'll thank you for
uh

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill this morning i hope
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
you find that it makes sense and
 
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.790 align:start position:0%
you find that it makes sense and
recommend

01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair uh i'm nature grays
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
association

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we do oppose this bill as written
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
but we are more than happy to work with
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor to
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh accomplish what he's attempting to do
 
01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
uh accomplish what he's attempting to do
here

01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and the reason we we oppose it um
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
is because that uh
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't i it doesn't seem to
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
do what the sponsor wants it to do um in
 
01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:12.310 align:start position:0%
do what the sponsor wants it to do um in
that

01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh once it changes the the language of
 
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.149 align:start position:0%
uh once it changes the the language of
rsa

01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
676 colon 4 and adds in
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
some wording so that it says upon the
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
determination by the planning board
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
the board that a submitted application
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
is complete according to the board's
 
01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.430 align:start position:0%

the public hearing pursuant to rsa 3657
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
but when you go to rsa 3657 that's
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the the board's required review
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
of a development to determine whether it
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
has a regional impact
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
and there's no actual hearing required
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
under that
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the way this is written it looks like
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's referencing a hearing which doesn't
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually occur so
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to accomplish what the
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants to accomplish which is to
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
speed up the process here
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and as i said i'm more than happy to
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor to
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
try to to to come up with some language
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
um that would accomplish what he's
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr graves are there any
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
for mr grace from the nhma on his on his
 
01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:25.350 align:start position:0%
for mr grace from the nhma on his on his
testimony

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative manchipudi
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair like i said i'm
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
staying true to my
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
conscience of asking questions being the
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
time on this committee uh my question to
 
01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:40.629 align:start position:0%
time on this committee uh my question to
you

01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative from new hampshire
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
municipal association is
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
how does this shift the responsibility
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
or ownership of local control versus
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
state or is there any way that this will
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
bring uniformity
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
amongst the municipalities that
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire so
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
does that um the way
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
that the process currently works is um
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you're going to submit
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
something like let's say a grocery store
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
and it's right on the border of two
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
towns um
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
and so you submit it to the town that
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're in and the planning board looks
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
at it and says okay well this is
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
obviously going to have a regional
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
impact because it's going to affect our
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
neighbors the municipality next door
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
more traffic etc so we're going to
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
provide them notice
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then once they have received notice
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
give us input about how that's going to
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
affect their community
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
just as any sort of any abutter would do
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
um or anyone else with
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
a a a right to um talk about it it's
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
basically to notify the municipality to
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
say hey
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know thanks to this grocery store
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to have you know estimated
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
double the amount of traffic on the
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
street or whatever the case may be
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
the current process and it seems like
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
what happened in representative
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
seaworth's case is that they ran into
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
a a problem with the
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
65 day deadline to
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
act upon the application mainly because
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the holidays and how everything
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
worked out there
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it certainly seems like the purpose
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
is to try to give some more flexibility
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
here to
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
the local planning board to ensure that
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
it can start this process a little bit
 
01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:40.709 align:start position:0%
it can start this process a little bit
sooner

01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
if it knows that it's going to be a
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
regional impact
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
sooner and therefore not run afoul that
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
65 days so still keep
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
still keep the entire process um
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
short within within that period but give
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to start
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
notifications a little bit earlier
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that's that seems to be the intent
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
as he explained it
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
although um if i misunderstood that
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'd certainly like representative
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay next we have a a question from
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um my actual questions have
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
been answered but
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um when i read this over and i'm sorry
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
i meant to mention it earlier line 19
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
the word platt is that supposed to be
 
01:39:30.639 --> 01:39:34.550 align:start position:0%
the word platt is that supposed to be
plan

01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it's supposed to be plat um
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
because because that's the um what
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're what they're called
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the other statutes
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just i as as
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%

will look up
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%

and then died in the senate as a result
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the covet issues
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
it what it does it's very it's very
 
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.870 align:start position:0%
it what it does it's very it's very
simple

01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
and what it does is create a rotating
 
01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:33.990 align:start position:0%
and what it does is create a rotating
term

01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
for one of the three grafton county
 
01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:39.189 align:start position:0%
for one of the three grafton county
commissioners

01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
one commissioner at all times would
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
serve a four-year term
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of doing so is to prevent
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
the situation which has occurred in the
 
01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:49.990 align:start position:0%
the situation which has occurred in the
past

01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
where you have three brand new
 
01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:53.270 align:start position:0%
where you have three brand new
commissioners

01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
all elected contemporaneously and none
 
01:58:56.719 --> 01:58:57.350 align:start position:0%
all elected contemporaneously and none
has

01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
any history or background with regard to
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
the operation of the county
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh we found that that is not a good
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance not a good situation
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is to provide continuity
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
i understand that other counties may
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
have similar type arrangements
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
we would start with the commissioner and
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
it would start with the election
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
with district one and that particular
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner would serve
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
four years and then each of the
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts would rotate
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
so you would have one commissioner
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
serving a four-year term at all times
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the very simple purpose of
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
for representative gordon
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
on the bill as he's testified yes so
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher has a question
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
so we had another bill
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
rockingham county wanting to move
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
some of their elections or
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
their officers term likes to be
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
four years as well um since
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
this bill does something similar to it
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
is there any possibility that they could
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
all right obviously we'd like to see
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
this bill move forward
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
but if you found it was more convenient
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
to combine the two bills
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
and they did the same thing serve the
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
same purpose
 
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there would be any
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes representative got
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
creating we're going to take out
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
at a later time i think that might be
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
the bill of referring to
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
nothing covers county commissions it
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
counts it covers the other
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
county offices it might be difficult
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
to marry the truth together
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from
 
02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.629 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from
representative

02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
morgan yes representative
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i'd like to take
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
of president um what is the term
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
now for the county commissions uh
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
each county commissioner serves a
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
two-year term
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
so they're elected every two years
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
are up for election on every two years
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
and there have been circumstances
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
where all three of our commissioners
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have three brand new commissioners
 
02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:02.790 align:start position:0%
we have three brand new commissioners
again

02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no possible way that you can
 
02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
so there's no possible way that you can
make

02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
your county commissioners work
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
alternating your two years and keeping
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh two on and one uh elected and then
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
next year next session do the same thing
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
you feel this is much easier is that
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying well
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
in effect that's what this bill does it
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
makes sure that you always have
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
one commissioner that has continuity
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be there
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
and isn't up for re-election in that
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you okay next question from
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative trill 11 and then we'll
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
go to main
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
things to do thank you mr chair and
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
thanks mr
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative gordon for coming to
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
testify um following up on
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher's question
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think i want to note that the
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
rockingham county commissioners
 
02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill change number i don't recall came
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
to us
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
wanting all commissioners to be
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
four-year terms
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
and this would be just one commissioner
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
four-year term i i understand what the
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
county is trying to do
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
um to retain some count
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
continuity i'm not sure they can go
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
together and as another
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh testifier has said earlier today you
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
know now that it's our bill we can
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
look at them and and see what we think
 
02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
look at them and and see what we think
um

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
my only comment thank you
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
if if i could just respond i i think
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
there was a consensus that we liked the
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
in most cases county commissioners are
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
elected for
 
02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
a two-year term and but
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
there was a need for that continuity
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
that's why we're only rotating one of
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's terms
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh and next we have a question from
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
representative manager rudy
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr t thank you representative
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
gordon for taking my question
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so if you're saying one commissioner
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
is going to serve four so over
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
three cycles all three commissioners
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
will be serving four year term
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
isn't it or is it just if it's going to
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
be rotating
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
and my second question uh
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
is also how does that change the statute
 
02:04:40.159 --> 02:04:40.790 align:start position:0%
is also how does that change the statute
that's

02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
well that's exactly what the bill does
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
it changes the statute the statute
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
currently says that each
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner serves a two-year term and
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
this would just change it so that one of
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioners would serve a
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
four-year term and you were correct
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they would be that it would rotate
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
among the
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
districts starting with district one and
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
then two and then three
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
so over uh a set of
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
three elections you would rotate
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the uh that four-year term
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up mr chair yes go
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
right ahead
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh so this is i mean the
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
two-year term for commissioners three
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners is a uniform across
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
all uh counties and
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
um why just start with one
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
i represent hillsborough county and it
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh all other uh every
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh elected position except the u.s
 
02:05:53.119 --> 02:05:54.390 align:start position:0%
uh elected position except the u.s
senate

02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's all two-year terms so it's
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to just carve out one pitch
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
how can we justify
 
02:06:02.079 --> 02:06:14.830 align:start position:0%
how can we justify
that

02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh incorrect but at least one other
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
county who has already
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
gone to this uh rotating scheme
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
which one i didn't hear his audio is not
 
02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
which one i didn't hear his audio is not
which

02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
county has already gone i think uh
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative gordon i think you cut
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
out from the audio
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
part of your response could you redo it
 
02:06:45.599 --> 02:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
part of your response could you redo it
yes

02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't um i i can't tell you which
 
02:06:49.679 --> 02:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
i i don't um i i can't tell you which
county

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that at least
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
one other county
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
has already gone to this type of
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
rotating longer term
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
in order to for the same purpose and
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we've already at the legislature's
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%

i put in 30 30 days
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
and talked to one of my commissioners
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
they requested that i increase it to 45
 
02:11:33.119 --> 02:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
they requested that i increase it to 45
days

02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
which i didn't see any problems with
 
02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.510 align:start position:0%
which i didn't see any problems with
that

02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
what i hope to do with this is to try to
 
02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
put some incentive to get the uh
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
the books closed a little bit earlier
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
and also to uh
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
keep on my particular county moving
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
forward and doing that
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think by having them contact um
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
revenue governor administration that
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
will give them incentives for
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
everyone to get our honor
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
to say we just completed our 2019 audit

amendment
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
no i was just checking to see if i got a
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
copy and i don't so it's still
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's still in process
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 445.
 
02:18:34.770 --> 02:18:34.780 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that
 
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.549 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that
[Music]

02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
has to do with competitive bidding and
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
cattle counting
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
and we have some input
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill may have some legal
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
problems and
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
what i what i think we ought to do is i
 
02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:56.389 align:start position:0%
what i what i think we ought to do is i
think

02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
we ought to retain this bill put it in
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
front of legal
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
counsel let them open on it and then we
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
take it back and
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
either change the bill make it legal
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
or accept it as is but i think
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
rather than putting a potentially
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
compromised bill in front of the house i
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
would like to see the committee agree to
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
and let legal go through it make sure
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
that there aren't any problems with it
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
but i'll open for discussion if anyone
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
opine on that thought so we would hold
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and work on it over the summer
 
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:37.830 align:start position:0%
the bill and work on it over the summer
and

02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
deal with it next year is that how that
 
02:19:39.519 --> 02:19:46.790 align:start position:0%
deal with it next year is that how that
works

02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
not hearing you mr chair i'm sorry i
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
that puts an echo in there you hear me
 
02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:03.190 align:start position:0%
that puts an echo in there you hear me
now

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's better yes we can hear you so uh
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
what we can do is we can retain it
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
until legal gives us an opinion and then
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
we can put it back on our account we
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding of a retained bill is
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we retain it
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
to work over the summer and and vote um
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
and in the second year we interim study
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
and do the same thing
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
but don't take it up for a vote because
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
the session is over
 
02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
well let's do this because i'm not sure
 
02:20:50.479 --> 02:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
well let's do this because i'm not sure
so

02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't uh we just plan on
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
taking it off the exact calendar
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
let's let me get some uh let me get an
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
expert opinion on how we
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
either going to retain it or just move
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
it out to the future a little bit
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i think if you call the clerk he would
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that question for us
 
02:21:22.479 --> 02:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that question for us
too

02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh dole dolan i'm more
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
than happy to
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
check in on that for you thank you
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
um mr chair i have a question about this
 
02:21:32.319 --> 02:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
um mr chair i have a question about this
process

02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
um i think i heard you say that
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
we would we would retain the bill get a
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
legal opinion on it and then
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
fix the bill isn't it
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
up to the sponsor to do that not the
 
02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.469 align:start position:0%
up to the sponsor to do that not the
committee

02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
what we would do is well once
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
once it's an executive session it's our
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill it's not the sponsor's ability
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we could we could fix it with an
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
we could itl the bill if it's too it's
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
too badly flawed or whatever
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
so it really becomes our when it's an
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
executive session it really becomes our
 
02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
executive session it really becomes our
fail

02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
fail
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's not no longer the sponsor's bill
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's a somewhat of a nuanced uh
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
answer but that's that's the way it
 
02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
answer but that's that's the way it
feels

02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
nice but to your point though i think
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
that if we found a flaw like that we
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
would certainly want to engage with the
 
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:32.870 align:start position:0%
would certainly want to engage with the
sponsor

02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
so house bill 445 will not be exact this
 
02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:48.710 align:start position:0%
so house bill 445 will not be exact this
afternoon

02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
until we uh unless we get an opinion
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
on how to retain but i'm
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
thinking that we'll push that out
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair we used to have an old saying
 
02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:10.550 align:start position:0%
mr chair we used to have an old saying
in

02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
municipal and county that we do
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
just so that was what i was learning
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
early on
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's also one i heard though if it's
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
a bad bill don't fix it
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
kill it so uh
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
with that advice uh i
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
i certainly uh don't disagree
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh the next bill to be exact is
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 560 which is the election of
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
there any discussion about that before
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
we move into that
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that bill do you remember that we heard
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure it looks like representative power
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
has her hand up
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman dolan for um taking
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
my um question so
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
my concern is with regard to this bill
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
it changes the term of the election of
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
all county offices in rockingham to four
 
02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
all county offices in rockingham to four
years

02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
and so my concern would be is what are
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
the ramifications are
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
what it would be the effect for
 
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
what it would be the effect for
rockingham

02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
counties elected officers
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
to be four years whereas in other
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
counties within the state
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would be different is is this is this
 
02:24:59.349 --> 02:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
a concern
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
or is it a non-concern
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
good point let's let's
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
leave that question on the table and see
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
if we can she wanted a bit uh
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
representatively you had a comment
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah um pardon my uh um
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
the the comment that i have is kind of a
 
02:25:20.479 --> 02:25:21.270 align:start position:0%
the the comment that i have is kind of a
question

02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
the last bill that we had that was
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
similar to this
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
in public hearing a comment was made
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
that other
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
counties are doing something similar but
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
when asked
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
directly what counties that answer
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't be given
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would feel more comfortable to know
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
what counties are
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
doing things similar with their
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners and and so on
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
before we voted on this um perhaps
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
someone from this committee does
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
know that answer um and and i do have
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that we're and i know someone's
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
got to be an example but that we're
 
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
got to be an example but that we're
piecemealing

02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
piecemealing
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
from county to county to county and not
 
02:25:57.359 --> 02:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
from county to county to county and not
um

02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to keep things similar um
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i do have some issues with that thank
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative tripp uh thank you for
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
taking my uh
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a question it's a statement
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
the uh if you look at the uh uh
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'll say 653 colon one this is the uh
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
rsa that's been amended by this uh
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
or change of this uh bill
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
section 6
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
e it says that sullivan county does the
 
02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
e it says that sullivan county does the
two

02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
two four term for commissioners
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh rockingham county does it two
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
two four for commissioners and uh
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
it appears that merrimack county does
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
the same also
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a precedent for
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:05.030 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a precedent for
having

02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
different terms
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a precedent
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
um representative power you have a
 
02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:22.309 align:start position:0%
um representative power you have a
follow-up

02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
um yes i would like to um answer
 
02:27:24.399 --> 02:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
um yes i would like to um answer
representative

representative
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
cle's inquiry so in preparation for the
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
hearing for this bill i did do research
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
and presently in new hampshire the
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
counties of carroll
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
um cheshire sullivan belknap rockingham
 
02:27:38.479 --> 02:27:39.510 align:start position:0%
um cheshire sullivan belknap rockingham
american

02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
american
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
merrimack and koas they have the
 
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
four-year two-year rotating terms
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
and this was all
 
02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
put on the books beginning in 1980 for
 
02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
put on the books beginning in 1980 for
cheshire

02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
cheshire
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i have dates for all of them and the
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
most recent
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
um i believe i'm looking at my notes
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
here it was merrimack
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
in 1996. so therefore
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
all counties within the state have this
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
four-year two-year rotating term
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
except presently for hillsborough
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
grafton and stratford
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
they still have the two-year terms for
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
commissioners

02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
having non-congruent terms across the
 
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.349 align:start position:0%
having non-congruent terms across the
counties

02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative may i also i'm just

bill
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
i would be comfortable in um
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
having an amendment such that the
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
county commissioner for rockingham um
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%

representative mcdonald do we have an
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment already on this uh i thought
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to receive
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
well i haven't i haven't seen it i'm
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
just thinking about that
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes uh representatives davis
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair for taking my
 
02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair for taking my
question

02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh my question has to do with the format
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the structure of this bill
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
as it's been presented to us as i read
 
02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
as it's been presented to us as i read
653-1

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
653-1
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
all of the counties that have
 
02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
lengths of terms for specific offices
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
are simply listed in alphabetical order
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
under letter a grafton and hillsborough
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
counties one county commissioner etc etc
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why this particular
 
02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:53.349 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why this particular
bill

02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
calls out except for rockingham county
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
why couldn't it just
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
follow the format of the others
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and simply list the terms
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand why it should be
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
in a different
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
different wording in a different format
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the law
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm still a little
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
concerned because
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking different kinds of
 
02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
we're talking different kinds of
officers

02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from listening to
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
previous testimony today the concern is
 
02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:33.910 align:start position:0%
previous testimony today the concern is
for

02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
continuation of institutional knowledge
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that one ca one county commissioner
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
has a four-year term
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the others have two this bill
 
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't dealing with county
 
02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
commissioners at all it's dealing with
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
the other offices
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
within the county um and so
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it it the rationale
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
for four years
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
is the same rationale as was given for
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
the four-year term
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
for county commissioners
 
02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:04.389 align:start position:0%
for county commissioners
[Music]

02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
i understand the argument that was given
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
for the four-year terms for this bill
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we can equate the
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
county commissioner four-year term
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
with these i don't think they're
 
02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
with these i don't think they're
parallel

02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other comments from

first of all what bill are we talking
 
02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:33.429 align:start position:0%

02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%

02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
yes we have an amendment it's two zero
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
two one
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
dash zero one eight seven h so what are
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's bill that amends house bill 560.
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know i got it but in the
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
conversation are we talking about the
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking about both um
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the amendment is a uh
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
a very small change just adds one more
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
position as the treasurer to the to the
 
02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
position as the treasurer to the to the
bill

02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay now i understand where we are i'm
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i was off in the woods with the
 
02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
sorry i was off in the woods with the
cat

02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
cat
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'll be back now thank you
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative manjapudi
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question i
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
am i was confused as to what we were
 
02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
am i was confused as to what we were
addressing

02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
and it seems like it's a piecemeal
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county coming from the
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know the similar institutional
 
02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:46.950 align:start position:0%
you know the similar institutional
knowledge

02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the election of every two years for
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
all the officers and changing that
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
does a fact and so
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
instead of changing the statue
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the state level why
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
each county is doing their own stuff and
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
it just i'm not able to wrap my head
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
around that
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay good comment uh thank you
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
um so we we had this amendment
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
that would uh change some of the
 
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
language to add
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the county treasurer as into the list of
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
this effects however
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
we will only vote on the amendment uh if
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay to proceed motion if it's a
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate then the
 
02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:49.990 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate then the
amendment

02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
is not in order we have a
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
hand up from representatives davis
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it's really not a
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
question it's a flippant comment
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative manjapudi welcome to
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes it can it can be a kind of piecemeal
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
at times
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:23.190 --> 02:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative guthrie thank you i'd
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
just like to make the comment that
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh you all recall that i think that
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
almost all of the officers that i
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill did come
 
02:35:34.479 --> 02:35:35.429 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill did come
forward

02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
didn't give us the same rationale which
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
was to
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
allow them to do their job better
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
instead of having to
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh campaign for their office uh the
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
second year that they were
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
in office so i just wanted to
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
remind a board that it was a
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much a unanimous presentation
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the people people holding
 
02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the office
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they use the same rationale
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to be fairly simple
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
as far as the bill was concerned well
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for that reminder
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the committee or
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's it we're not going to go to the
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
public we're just taking comments in the
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
community yes
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative powell is it is it
 
02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:27.510 align:start position:0%
representative powell is it is it
correct

02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners in the state
 
02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:30.790 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners in the state
there

02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
they receive a stipend and not a salary
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
per se
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
whereas the other uh elected county
 
02:36:37.359 --> 02:36:38.550 align:start position:0%
whereas the other uh elected county
officers

02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
they do receive a salary for their um
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
positions that's a good question
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure if the the positions
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
listed here
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh receive some do i think some do
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
receive a salary
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh the elected officials don't they just
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh receive mileage and i think there's
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
an hourly rate that's also paid
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to elected officials also for
 
02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
to uh to elected officials also for
meetings

02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
but uh like the treasurer the
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds the sheriff things
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
like that the county attorney they all
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
they do have a salary that they pay
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative porter um yes thank you
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
all of those positions are elected it's
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
just the county delegation who doesn't
 
02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:29.590 align:start position:0%
just the county delegation who doesn't
get

02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
a salary not the county officers but
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the point that they all
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
expressed to us that they could do their
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
jobs better
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
if they had a four-year term rather than
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
a two-year term my
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
counter to that is i sure could have
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
done my job better with a four-year
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
term as well i think most of us would
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have to go out and
 
02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:50.389 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have to go out and
campaign

02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
after two years of serving um it would
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
be much better for us
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
we could devote our time to our position
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
and not have to worry about that so
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they all would like to have a
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
four-year position just as i would like
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
to have a four-year position
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not sure in my mind still
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the best thing
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
for the people of the citizens of the
 
02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:11.349 align:start position:0%
for the people of the citizens of the
county

02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
to not to have four-year terms for their
 
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.110 align:start position:0%
to not to have four-year terms for their
officers

02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%

02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
wondering why we didn't see her
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
also she said she sent um and i have
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
received it in my personal email
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%

02:46:40.469 --> 02:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
committee be aware of that
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and look in your email from something
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
from representative suzanne smith
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the bill that
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative gordon just
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
um spoke to us about what bill was that
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
system that we have now for signing on
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
to bills if you can't sign on
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
to speak once the hearing has started
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
and what is in the
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
remote testify with the feet that we get
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
it might just be a quirk of the system
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
but it is something we should be aware
 
02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
but it is something we should be aware
of

02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
because emergencies are going to be
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
happening and people are going to have
 
02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:06.950 align:start position:0%
happening and people are going to have
to

02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
sign in late um upon occasion so
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
if i could um representative board of
 
02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative majori i'm more than
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer this question
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you christine that would be great
 
02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
thank you christine that would be great
uh

02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
so we have to print the testimony sheets
 
02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
first thing in the morning but it is
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
if people sign up after eight o'clock
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
that it is uh the purview of the chair
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
to ask for um public
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
that may have not been signed up in time
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
for that eight o'clock printing
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
so there will be public that are not on
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
the list but we just can't
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
we aren't able to do it for each bill so
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
um we just request that the chair ask
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
for public commentary
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
and those folks would raise their hands
 
02:48:53.429 --> 02:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to speak
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
well that may that makes sense
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how then we have someone
 
02:49:01.830 --> 02:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
who would be introducing a bill in
 
02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:02.950 align:start position:0%
who would be introducing a bill in
someone's

02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
place how does that work the same way
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that they email the
 
02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:10.950 align:start position:0%
i would recommend that they email the
committee

02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that particular change and if it um
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
they or they raise their hand um we're
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
in kind of a new world so that's
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
something i can bring back
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
i can bring back to um house committee
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
services with that point and we can
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
hello okay i got it
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
yep can you hear me a little bit better
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
the host muted me oh my goodness
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
we can hear you um without muting and
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
i'm that that would be i want to avoid
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
feedback sorry
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say i i accept the
 
02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
failure on that one because i see that
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
the email came through
 
02:50:08.230 --> 02:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
about a quarter after 11 but i didn't
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
immediately recognize it as someone who
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
who wanted to stop who wanted to speak
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh to this um it's just that like you
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
say the system of trying to figure out
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you can
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
read the email and recognize these folks
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
um while you're doing the meeting too so
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
i will be more attentive tonight
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly send apologies to
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore yes
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
how how long is the break do we know
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um i imagine it's going to end very soon
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:51:58.830 --> 02:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%

we have
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%

the bill
 
02:53:53.429 --> 02:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is carolyn lear i'm
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner at the
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of revenue can
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
you all hear me okay yes you're doing
 
02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:03.830 align:start position:0%
you all hear me okay yes you're doing
fine

02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill really has its roots in a
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
situation that
 
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2017 in the town of
 
02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
occurred in 2017 in the town of
goffstown

02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the school district had discovered an
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
accumulated fund balance of
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 million dollars
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
and decided to use this money to offset
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of taxes that needed to be
 
02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
raised for local education in
 
02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
2018. as a result this caused
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
a significant one-time drop in
 
02:54:35.439 --> 02:54:36.469 align:start position:0%
a significant one-time drop in
goffstown's

02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
goffstown's
 
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
property tax rate and
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
because municipalities use
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
the prior year's tax rate for purposes
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
of calculating the first
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
property tax billing
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
had the rate not been modified
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
goffstown would have drastically over
 
02:54:58.800 --> 02:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
goffstown would have drastically over
collected

02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
with their first billing and had to
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
collect significantly less in their
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
second billing
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
goffstown reached out to the department
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
and asked us to assist them with the
 
02:55:15.790 --> 02:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
situation by
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
recalculating their tax rate um
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
for purposes of that first billing to
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
really account for the fact
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they had a bunch of additional
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
money that wasn't really accounted for
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
in last year's rate the effect was to
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
sort of smooth
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
out the property tax billing over the
 
02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
course of that
 
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
year and avoid um significantly over
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
collecting in the first
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
half we did do
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
that recalculation perk offs town
 
02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
that recalculation perk offs town
request

02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
but we felt that it would be ideal if
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
the statute was
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
clear for every municipality um
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
that this was something that could be
 
02:55:58.479 --> 02:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
that this was something that could be
done

02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
and also we think that the legislature
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
is the right body to sort of weigh
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
in on how significant
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
a change in the amount to be collected
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
in order to trigger our ability to do
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
that recalculation
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
the legislation sets that um
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
that at 15 a 15 change from year to year
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
um that sort of summarizes why we've
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
requested this bill and i'm happy to
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%

and we haven't yes we have one question
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
from representative power
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um for taking my
 
02:57:04.319 --> 02:57:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um for taking my
question

02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you ms lear for your testimony
 
02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
my question is with regard to the
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
language of this bill
 
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
does this pertain only in the instance
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
or case in which there is
 
02:57:20.710 --> 02:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
excess tax or excess revenue
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
no it does not it would it would apply
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
in the opposite situation as well and in
 
02:57:25.359 --> 02:57:26.309 align:start position:0%
in the opposite situation as well and in
fact

02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
in the case of the town of goffstown we
 
02:57:32.710 --> 02:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
did do the recalculation a second
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
time in the next year because
 
02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there wasn't a 10 million dollar
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
excess in revenue in 18 there had been
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
so we again had to modify the first
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
property bill
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
property tax rate for bills upwards
 
02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
to avoid drastically under collecting
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the first billing for the town of
 
02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
in the first billing for the town of
goffstown

02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
goffstown
 
02:57:59.910 --> 02:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
again the goal being just to smooth it
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
out so that there's only 50
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
any follow-up yes yes follow-up so
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
um i was having a little bit of the
 
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
difficulty abstracting in my mind
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
what the what this would look like um i
 
02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:21.910 align:start position:0%
what the what this would look like um i
guess

02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah what it would look like so i guess
 
02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
my question now is
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
um is there any
 
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
possibility that there could be a
 
02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:32.469 align:start position:0%
possibility that there could be a
deficit

02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the amount of um taxes collected
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what was raised and
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the meeting
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
i think that the answer is no based on
 
02:58:42.479 --> 02:58:43.590 align:start position:0%
i think that the answer is no based on
your

02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
most recent explanation is that a
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
correct understanding
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct it doesn't change
 
02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
the ultimate amount of tax that
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
would be collected in any year it just
 
02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:55.590 align:start position:0%
would be collected in any year it just
um

02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
prevents it from being either over or
 
02:59:00.630 --> 02:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
under collected in the first half
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that clarifies
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none any any comments or
 
02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none any any comments or
questions

02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%

sponsor nhma supports this bill

billing as ms lear
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
stated provides a win-win in terms of
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
cash flow for both municipalities and
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
individual property taxpayers so we
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%

own i'm not representing any client
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
i oppose hb 404 i handle court cases
 
03:12:13.110 --> 03:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
including cases involving real estate
 
03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
including cases involving real estate
disputes

03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
in some of those cases the judge will
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
take what we call a view of the
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the property as bound or the boundary
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
line that's in dispute
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
the judge and the parties need definite
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
markers on the ground
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
as the best evidence of what the borders
 
03:12:28.319 --> 03:12:29.269 align:start position:0%
as the best evidence of what the borders
are

03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
actual markers are much more helpful and
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
reliable than photos
 
03:12:36.389 --> 03:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
or computer images definite markers are
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
a frame of reference that are not in
 
03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:38.550 align:start position:0%
a frame of reference that are not in
dispute

03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
many times that takes the form of a
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
clearly marked town line
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
another example of this would be the
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
white stone markers that dot
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
places on the edge of the highway
 
03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
places on the edge of the highway
right-of-way

03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
so if i'm in court or preparing a deed
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
or advising a town board it helps me and
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
my clients to have those definite
 
03:12:58.239 --> 03:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
my clients to have those definite
markers

03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
markers
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
such as a town line that's been blazed
 
03:13:03.190 --> 03:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
and properly marked
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
pre-ambulation is a key part of keeping
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
those town boundaries
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
as one of the forms of those definite
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
markers that we need in the legal system
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
that is why i oppose hb 404 i ask that
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
it be voted
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and i would be
 
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.510 --> 03:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move on to mr bigfoot
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
if he's uh online
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
you should be all good well mr bigfoot
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
that he's there i'm
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
asking him to hunt you it is
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry um my name is david
 
03:13:49.030 --> 03:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
bickford i'm from new durham
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh where this bill initiated from the uh
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i had asked them to do their
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
paramulation and point of the laurel to
 
03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
the slug men
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they avoided it uh year after year
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i finally did
 
03:14:03.990 --> 03:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
take them to court but i decided to drop
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
it when
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
the covid came forward they don't feel
 
03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
the covid came forward they don't feel
they

03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:14:10.469 --> 03:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
have to do it the budget committee said
 
03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
that they were not interested in doing
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
the perembulation because they didn't
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
feel they had to do it
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so there's this feeling out there
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
that um they don't have to do this even
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
though the legislature has said for
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
many many many years that this needs to
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
be done
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
now i don't dispute the fact that it may
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
we may want to make it
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh more than seven years
 
03:14:34.150 --> 03:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
but this bill comes back and says well
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
whenever the men
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
feel is a necessity basically that's
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
like a repeal
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
when i was a selectman believe me if i
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
saw that
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be doing it okay so if the
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislature wants it done
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
at all they would they should itl
 
03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written okay thank you
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:14:55.680 --> 03:14:57.190 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
from mr bigfoot excuse me
 
03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
mr grays from the nhma and we have
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
mr stock after that from new hampshire
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
timberland association
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay all good mr gray's you're up please
 
03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:31.429 align:start position:0%
okay all good mr gray's you're up please
uh

03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is nate from the
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
we are in support of hp 404
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
we think that it makes sense to allow
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
local communities and their governing
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
boards to determine when it is
 
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to preambulate
 
03:15:51.510 --> 03:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that's really the summation of my
 
03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
and that's really the summation of my
testimony

03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes can i ask you a question to the
 
03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:05.190 align:start position:0%
yes can i ask you a question to the
question

03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes this is a question from
 
03:16:09.190 --> 03:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
03:16:12.309 --> 03:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
mr graves greg if you have any
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh executive uh your testimony do you
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
have any information as far as
 
03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
the satellite imagery
 
03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
as to how effective that is and just
 
03:16:26.950 --> 03:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i'm not an expert in the satellite
 
03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
imagery but
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
what i would imagine because
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
realistically what this
 
03:16:40.710 --> 03:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
premulation is trying to do is
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh there are clear
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries between the towns what you
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
would be doing with the satellite
 
03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:48.710 align:start position:0%
would be doing with the satellite
imagery

03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
imagery
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
is changing that to gps coordinates
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
which are obviously regulated by the
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
the us government and effectively you'd
 
03:16:57.990 --> 03:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
be able to get
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
boundary lines that are within inches
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
um and that that could be very effective
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
all you would need
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
obviously to determine the difference
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
between one town and another is
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
is a gps device with some
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
degree of accuracy and i i do know that
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
many assessors and many
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
tax mapping organizations for instance
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
gps mapping now rather than
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
doing um you know old
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
what i would call old-fashioned surveys
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
of going from
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know the large rock and in the
 
03:17:36.309 --> 03:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
corner of someone's property to the old
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
hickory tree as
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
as is in many deeds i just think that
 
03:17:40.399 --> 03:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
as is in many deeds i just think that
the

03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:45.269 --> 03:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
gps based seems to be the most
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes can you can you hear me
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
we start we had a question from
 
03:18:03.910 --> 03:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
i have a lot louder from now on
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh is the person from nhmany still there
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
do i understand that if you wanted to
 
03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
do i understand that if you wanted to
verify

03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
a point along the line you would use a
 
03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:28.790 align:start position:0%
a point along the line you would use a
gps

03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
gps
 
03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
device and you would still have to walk
 
03:18:34.229 --> 03:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
out into the woods or whatever
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the gps device would tell you where
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
you are
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
and from that you would be able to say
 
03:18:40.239 --> 03:18:41.670 align:start position:0%
and from that you would be able to say
oh

03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is this point is can uh uh
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
gary and this point is in londonderry
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not a surveyor so i'm not exactly
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
sure how they
 
03:18:54.389 --> 03:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
conduct it but my understanding is they
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
do do field work where they go out
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they map things on uh via gps and
 
03:18:59.760 --> 03:19:00.309 align:start position:0%
and they map things on uh via gps and
essentially

03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
they create a 3d model of the earth and
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's what they
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
they use although it may be smaller to
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
scale because you're only talking about
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
hello presenter fiamonte i i can answer
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
your question
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
gps is pretty accurate it used to be uh
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
where they'd be 15-20 feet away from
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
the odds but now they're pretty much
 
03:19:29.670 --> 03:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
right on the money they used to be the
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
two north or
 
03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:41.190 --> 03:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes follow up i will follow so uh
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
so what would happen in a boundary
 
03:19:43.279 --> 03:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
so what would happen in a boundary
dispute

03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
you you would use these gps coordinates
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
derived from some method and you would
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
still have to go out in the woods
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
and verify that once again
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
that at this point
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
everything to the left is in one town
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
and everything to the right is
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'd defer to representative pimante
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
looks like he he knows more about this
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
yes last i remember the testimony we had
 
03:20:22.870 --> 03:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
from last year
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
and these are markers that are out in
 
03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
and these are markers that are out in
the

03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
field or wherever they have
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
they get overgrown um after 10 years
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
you would never find them in gps more
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
than likely
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
so the gps will direct you to where the
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
marker is you have to verify the marker
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
at that point there right there are
 
03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
now you're using a uh the gps cord
 
03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
you want to direct the question to the
 
03:21:21.269 --> 03:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
person on the
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's just for this executive all right
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's okay you're just gonna kind of
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
question what he's already said he
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't know
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallagher had a
 
03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallagher had a
question

03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes um you have experience
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
working with satellite imagery yourself
 
03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.269 align:start position:0%
working with satellite imagery yourself
and

03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
i do not really have any experience with
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
working with satellite imagery except in
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
so far i've answered questions about
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
tax maps and some other legal questions
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
along that
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.030 --> 03:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up how did
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
come to the determination that satellite
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
imagery would be a
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
suitable replacement for perambulation
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think the goal is to try to be as
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
accurate as possible
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
for the the town boundaries and to
 
03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that people
 
03:22:42.790 --> 03:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
know where those are um so
 
03:22:44.950 --> 03:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like the intent of the statute
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
have boundary markers um
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
and the obligation of the select board
 
03:22:53.429 --> 03:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
to go out and
 
03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
pre-ambulate with beach just to ensure
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
that they're there
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
um you know as it appears that there's a
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
transition in surveying to gps
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
use it may make more sense to
 
03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:08.469 align:start position:0%
use it may make more sense to
[Music]

03:23:08.469 --> 03:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:23:12.150 --> 03:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
look at satellite imagery and and gps
 
03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:12.550 align:start position:0%
look at satellite imagery and and gps
use

03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:23:16.469 --> 03:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
as as a modern modern approach to this
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
um again i'm not an expert but
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would seem to be acceptable
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly aware that where there
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
are boundary lines disputes it is up to
 
03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
are boundary lines disputes it is up to
the

03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
it could be up to the courts to
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
determine you know what the exact
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
boundaries are between
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
properties whether that's private
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
properties or municipalities although
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully at this point
 
03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities are aware of where their
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
boundaries are given their long-standing
 
03:23:43.439 --> 03:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
boundaries are given their long-standing
existence

03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
committee

03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
yes this is uh
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
my question is do other states
 
03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
use this procedure and
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
secondly what do you do in the case
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
of a wetland or a river
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
traverse

03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
traverse
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
there are no exceptions within the
 
03:24:29.590 --> 03:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
statute about
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
whether you can physically traverse or
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
not um
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i assume that
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh select boards have been required to
 
03:24:39.990 --> 03:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
pre-emulate those
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
places have figured out some sort of
 
03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
places have figured out some sort of
option

03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
i would imagine it would be physically
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
impossible in some cases
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
but i don't you know i don't know that
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
those lands are in dispute
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that that many people
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
are too concerned
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
as far as other states my understanding
 
03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
is that there
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts and other states new
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
england which originally had this
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
obligation many of them have
 
03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:08.550 align:start position:0%
obligation many of them have
transitioned

03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
transitioned
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
to something similar to what the statute
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
or this
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill would be proposing which is that um
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
pre-ambulation as
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
necessary is determined by the local
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
so um there wouldn't be
 
03:25:24.229 --> 03:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know an obligation to it at a set
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe there are many
 
03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
states in the union which do require
 
03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
states in the union which do require
preambulation

03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair i um i do recognize that you uh
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
that you recognize jason stop but i do
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
see that mr bickford's hand
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
is raised i don't know if there's a
 
03:25:45.910 --> 03:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
response to some questions that have
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
been asked and i
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
thought i'd bring it to your attention
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay i would ask mr bigfoot
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
to uh hold on we have a few more people
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
who like to testify and then we'll come
 
03:25:55.040 --> 03:25:55.510 align:start position:0%
who like to testify and then we'll come
back

03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:25:58.309 --> 03:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
for folks who want to testify a second
 
03:25:58.319 --> 03:25:59.670 align:start position:0%
for folks who want to testify a second
time

03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh his mark and pardon my uh
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
attempt at the your last name condo
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
dammit tracky is that is that close
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
you see you see mark on the
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
i do not he's from the new hampshire
 
03:26:23.910 --> 03:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
land surveyors association okay
 
03:26:27.190 --> 03:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
we'll come back if he's here uh next
 
03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
is uh gerald miller and then we'll go to
 
03:26:29.920 --> 03:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
is uh gerald miller and then we'll go to

okay all good hey mr miller

february 4th and 5th
 
03:27:22.389 --> 03:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
that goes into more detail than we can
 
03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
cover today in this testimony
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your submission i've had
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
over 40 years
 
03:27:31.990 --> 03:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
experience as a land surveyor dealing
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
with town lines
 
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
their perambulations limitations
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
both good and bad the past couple of
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
decades i've been testifying on a number
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
of legislative acts that seek to make
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 51
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
ineffective or eliminated completely
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
once again this proposed act hp
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
404 four is attempting to essentially
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
make rsa 51
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
ineffective by changing sections two
 
03:28:06.389 --> 03:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
and three this is a really bad idea
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of preambulation or to
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
prambly means to
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
make an official inspection of the
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
boundary on foot
 
03:28:17.190 --> 03:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
this is not something that is optional
 
03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:17.670 align:start position:0%
this is not something that is optional
it

03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
quote shall be perambulated unquote
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
if a prerambulation is not done on a
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
regular timetable
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
which is currently seven years not
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
quote as often as the selectmen
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
determined is necessary
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
uncle as house bill 404 proposes
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
then the marks and bounds will
 
03:28:41.750 --> 03:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately by either nature
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
or man-made reasons be lost forever
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
which has and will result in major
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
expenses to individuals and
 
03:28:50.840 --> 03:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
expenses to individuals and
municipalities

03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
also hb 404 proposes adding to rsa
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
51 colon 2 quote in lieu of
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
perembulation of the town lines methods
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
such as satellite imagery may be used
 
03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:07.670 align:start position:0%
such as satellite imagery may be used
unquote

03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
let's break this down in lieu of
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
permulation of town lines
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
means no feet on the ground no eyes on
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
the bounds
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
no ability to describe accurately the
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
status of the town line for section
 
03:29:26.469 --> 03:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
51 colon 4 the return of rsa 51 that is
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be recorded with the secretary of

03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
and in the town records of both towns
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
such as satellite imagery being used as
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
an example
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
of a method that may be used
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
very broadly very broad terminology and
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
something that is totally useless as a
 
03:29:45.760 --> 03:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
something that is totally useless as a
substitute

03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%

03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%

whether it be photographic lidar
 
03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
infrared has the ability to renew
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
or mark bounds i'm referring to the
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
second task
 
03:30:04.150 --> 03:30:04.160 align:start position:0%

03:30:06.229 --> 03:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
in very few cases with the best
 
03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560 align:start position:0%

03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%

03:30:43.990 --> 03:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
covered by fallen leaves or moss
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
nor would satellite imagery be able to
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
find missing bounds
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
that had been dropped from the
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
perambulation returns due to lack of
 
03:30:51.279 --> 03:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
perambulation returns due to lack of
proper

03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%

03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
permulations or discovered that a
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%

03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
or be aware that bounds that have been
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
dug up
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
and moved broken or buried by plows
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
in any number of construction situations
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in technology as good
 
03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in technology as good
as

03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
or in lieu of a proper permutation as
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
feet on the ground and eyes on the
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
bounds it's all about carefully
 
03:31:23.110 --> 03:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining the bounds
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's what is important about rsa 51
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
colon 2
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the seven year period intended to
 
03:31:32.309 --> 03:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
limit the chances of them
 
03:31:34.950 --> 03:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
being lost and thereby preventing
 
03:31:34.960 --> 03:31:35.910 align:start position:0%
being lost and thereby preventing
encumbrances

03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
encumbrances
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
in courts basically it is human nature
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
not to do something that you don't want
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
or don't think you are capable of doing
 
03:31:47.670 --> 03:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
and you won't unless there is something
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that requires you to do by law
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
it is also human nature to feel guilty
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
about it too especially when it's your
 
03:31:54.720 --> 03:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
about it too especially when it's your
responsibility

03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
your duty every time there is a change
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
in members of this committee
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
another bill like this one is brought
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
forward for your deliberation
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
and while i'm alive and made aware of an
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
attack on this law
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
i will be there to defend it it's that
 
03:32:12.479 --> 03:32:13.990 align:start position:0%
i will be there to defend it it's that
important

03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
it is my wish though that i will never
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
have to do it again
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
again i respectfully request that you
 
03:32:20.560 --> 03:32:21.030 align:start position:0%
again i respectfully request that you
vote

03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%

make this brief and thank you very much

for for holding the hearing and allowing

us to participate

my name is mark condo demetraki i'm

speaking on behalf of the new hampshire

land surveyors association
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
and we we are opposed to this bill
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
we feel that perambulation is a very
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
important aspect
 
03:33:05.349 --> 03:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
of determining and maintaining
 
03:33:05.359 --> 03:33:06.469 align:start position:0%

monumentation

03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
monumentation
 
03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
and town boundaries we also believe that
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
it is an extremely
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
important historical
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh preservation bill that
 
03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
as you know new hampshire is one of the
 
03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
original colonial states
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
and there are boundary markers that date
 
03:33:23.200 --> 03:33:24.070 align:start position:0%
and there are boundary markers that date
back

03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:33:27.190 --> 03:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
several hundred years which it is in our
 
03:33:28.150 --> 03:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
to preserve i would just like to point
 
03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:32.150 align:start position:0%
to preserve i would just like to point
out

03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
several statements that mr gray's
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
stated about gps and aerial photography
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
there are multiple
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
differences in technology out there
 
03:33:47.910 --> 03:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
multiple vendors that create gps
 
03:33:54.150 --> 03:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
data collection devices and there are
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
multiple vendors that
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
render aerial imagery there is no
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
standard for the aerial imagery and
 
03:34:03.670 --> 03:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
aerial imagery
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh can have significant differences due
 
03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:07.349 align:start position:0%
uh can have significant differences due
to

03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
it not being orthorectified correctly um
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
so you can have overlaps gps
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
does not collect data very well when you
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
have areas of heavy and dense
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
tree cover and so what you end up with
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
is potential overlaps in that
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
coordinate data which can then create
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
more disputes
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
you can already see uh in different
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
versions of gis mapping
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
that communities have that there are
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
overlaps in
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
the town lines as they're rendered on
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
their gis
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
mapping a lot of this has come from
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
different coordinate systems and the
 
03:34:49.750 --> 03:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between the use
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
of you know state plane or
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
some other horizontal coordinate
 
03:34:59.190 --> 03:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
system so the other
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i just want to
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
point out is that you know this
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
law states that the towns must
 
03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
law states that the towns must
preambulate

03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
preambulate
 
03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
their boundaries to preserve them but it
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
does not say
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
that the selectmen themselves have to do
 
03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:12.630 align:start position:0%
that the selectmen themselves have to do
it

03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
the selectmen uh and the town fathers
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to get to delegate
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
this to uh different civic organizations
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
many civic organizations that would be
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
more than willing
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know to perform these tasks on a
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
regular basis such as the girl scouts
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
or the boy scouts or other or other
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
organizations so
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
it is not something that the selectmen
 
03:35:37.359 --> 03:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
it is not something that the selectmen
themselves

03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
are required to do and really i think
 
03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:42.469 align:start position:0%
are required to do and really i think
until

03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
until
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature creates a specific
 
03:35:44.880 --> 03:35:46.309 align:start position:0%
the legislature creates a specific
standard

03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that everyone must follow for both
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
aerial photography
 
03:35:54.150 --> 03:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and gps data collection
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for there to be
 
03:35:56.479 --> 03:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for there to be
differences

03:35:57.190 --> 03:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
differences
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
in that data that is collected and
 
03:35:59.439 --> 03:36:00.229 align:start position:0%
in that data that is collected and
presented

03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
presented
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
and then the question will become who is
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
correct and what information you hold
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions that
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee has
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that let me move to oh i'm sorry
 
03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:17.910 align:start position:0%
seeing that let me move to oh i'm sorry
mr

03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative tripp thank you mr chair
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh i know you're not a lawyer but uh uh
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
what is the legal definition of a
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
boundary is it the
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
marker so i'm i'm
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney so
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know a boundary can come in many
 
03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:39.269 align:start position:0%
uh you know a boundary can come in many
many

03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
shapes and forms it can be a natural
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
monument such as a river
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
um a ridge of a mountain uh you know
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
some some other form a lake etc uh it
 
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
a stone wall or a stone monument
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
that was um that was set by
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
by someone it could be any kind of
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
iron pipe or rebar
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
or any myriad of items that could have
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
been set in the ground
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
that was determined by the parties to be
 
03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
that was determined by the parties to be
that

03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
property corner or or boundary so
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
monumentation comes in all different
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
shapes and
 
03:37:18.399 --> 03:37:21.429 align:start position:0%
shapes and
sizes

03:37:21.429 --> 03:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
follow up hello please thank you mr
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
chair so uh
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh since you're not a lawyer would it be
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
that uh the gbs coordinates would be
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
used to assist
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
you in finding where the boundaries are
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
certainly gps coordinates are helpful in
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
assisting in finding
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
where those boundaries are if they have
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
already been established
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
you know by a specific you know gps
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
coordinate um you know the issue would
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
then become that potentially the gps
 
03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:53.349 align:start position:0%
then become that potentially the gps
system

03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm using um may be a little bit
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
different than
 
03:37:59.429 --> 03:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
a gps system that someone else is using
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
which would certainly be different than
 
03:38:04.150 --> 03:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
a gps that is collected say on someone's
 
03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:05.269 align:start position:0%
a gps that is collected say on someone's
iphone

03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
iphone
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
or samsung phone because again that
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be a different
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
wave that the device devices is reading
 
03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
which would give a different
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
coordinate and a different view so
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
physically you know physically
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
preambulating and finding those
 
03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
preambulating and finding those
monuments

03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
monuments
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
is very important certainly the gps is
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to get you close
 
03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
but preserving that monumentation
 
03:38:31.189 --> 03:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
is extremely important and not relying
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
specifically on that one
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of the gps until there is a
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
specific standard
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
for that data collection i think would
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
call into question if a monument was
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
ever moved or
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
changed or shifted
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you next we'll hear from
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we have a handout from
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
my master to unmute
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you my apologies um thank you for
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
concerning differences in uh gps systems
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i am not
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
a professional by any stretch of the
 
03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
imagination but i am
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
on the planning board here in lebanon
 
03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we use the new hampshire state plane
 
03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
and we use the new hampshire state plane
coordinates

03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
coordinates
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
isn't that a statewide system where
 
03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:41.830 align:start position:0%
isn't that a statewide system where
everything

03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
agrees with everything else and
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
therefore there is no
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
concern that there are differing systems
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
with differing measurements
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
in theory yes in theory everything
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
the same but unfortunately when you're
 
03:39:55.840 --> 03:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
the same but unfortunately when you're
interjecting

03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
interjecting
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
humans into that equation you're always
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
some margin of error and it could be
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
due to the setup of the equipment you
 
03:40:08.550 --> 03:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
know perhaps someone set equipment up
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh differently or there was an error in
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
setting up the equipment or there was
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
different equipment that was used you
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
know there could be calibration issues
 
03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:20.389 align:start position:0%
know there could be calibration issues
and

03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
measurement devices for setting up that
 
03:40:22.319 --> 03:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
measurement devices for setting up that
equipment

03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
so there are always there's always
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to inject error into
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
information and reading now the wave
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
itself that comes from the satellite
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
won't change
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
but the way that potentially someone
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
sets the equipment up to
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
accept that information could may i have
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question please
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that answer and
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
i hope you don't consider this flippant
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
but i'll ask anyway
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
um when you say injecting
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
human action into the process
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
isn't perambulation the most human
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
action process
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that there is and how is it that
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
physical human perambulation
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
has none of the faults that the gps
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
system has
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
well that's a that's a fantastic
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
question and
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
what i want to point out is is the point
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
of perambulation
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
is to locate and uncover existing
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
monumentation and again that's why as
 
03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:34.150 align:start position:0%
monumentation and again that's why as
surveyors

03:41:34.150 --> 03:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
surveyors
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
we specifically set
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
and locate specific monumentation
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
on the ground so that there is no
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
question that that point where that
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
monument is
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
is the delineation of that corner or
 
03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:50.630 align:start position:0%
is the delineation of that corner or
line

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:41:54.150 --> 03:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
etc so the permutation of going out
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
and and finding this monumentation
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
then obviously would support the use and
 
03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
then obviously would support the use and
collection

03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
collection
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
of gps but to rely solely
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the aerial photography and the gps
 
03:42:08.640 --> 03:42:09.429 align:start position:0%
on the aerial photography and the gps
data

03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
and allow these historical monuments to
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
deteriorate or be lost
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
would then create other issues and
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
problems that occur
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
when once again the data that is
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
collected is questioned
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
or there is an issue that's found with
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that data
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
so really the importance of
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
perambulation is
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
is maintaining a historical marker of
 
03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:35.349 align:start position:0%
is maintaining a historical marker of
significance

03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
significance
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
for the state and its history and
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
your question certainly has a great
 
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
merit and
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
the the answer lies in the actual
 
03:42:45.439 --> 03:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
the the answer lies in the actual
physical

03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
physical
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony um
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
next we'll we'll hear from
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh if she's on the line linda bronson
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay i got it now i i couldn't figure
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
out how to do it because my picture's
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
not up
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now you're doing fine
 
03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:34.229 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now you're doing fine
okay

03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank thank you chairman dolan and
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
committee members for allowing me the
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
time to testify
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
in regards to house bill 404
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
i am a resident in wentworth new
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire grafton county
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
along with my husband we manage 200
 
03:43:51.030 --> 03:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
acres of
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
mixed hardwoods and conifers our land is
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
divided nearly 50
 
03:43:58.870 --> 03:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
50 between the towns of wentworth
 
03:44:01.990 --> 03:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
and orford interest in this subject
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
matter stems from management needs to
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
have these town boundaries clearly
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
marked and maintained
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
for this reason i oppose house bill 404
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
my forest management plan calls for
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
periodic sustainable harvesting
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the creation of wildlife habitat for
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
this reason we perform
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
patch cuts and timber stand improvement
 
03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
in a somewhat
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
rotating fashion as all four parcels of
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
this contiguous property are divided by
 
03:44:33.750 --> 03:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
the town
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
line it is imperative that i know
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
exactly where the line stands
 
03:44:42.150 --> 03:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
for intent to cut purposes uh
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
and to assess the timber yield tax
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
um a couple years ago wentworth and
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
orford were conducting the perambulation
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the line going through
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
my property and uh uh
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
they uh they came to a halt with their
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
orange paint at the edge of a large
 
03:45:01.359 --> 03:45:02.550 align:start position:0%
orange paint at the edge of a large
opening

03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
opening
 
03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
not seeing any more marked trees to
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
follow because we had
 
03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
a patch cut there helping them out
 
03:45:12.150 --> 03:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
we carefully reconstructed the markers
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
through that cut area
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
on stumps and rock piles to join the
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
existing line
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
enabling future maintenance of the
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
boundary line
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
this was possible because of
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
well-maintained border lines
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
satellite imagery would not have picked
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
up this
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh on the underground maintenance of the
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
town boundary lines can also
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for those markers
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh to be on the lookout for possible
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
current use transgressions for example
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
as well as just becoming familiar with
 
03:45:55.189 --> 03:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
changes in the land
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
my impression in talking with these
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
fellas is they were
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
they actually enjoyed the work they
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
enjoyed meeting the landowners
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
owners and they uh just enjoyed being
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
out in the woods
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
last fall another example last fall my
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
husband and i decided to build a cabin
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
for guests
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
on one of our parcels of land divided by
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
the two towns
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
the portion of the forested land
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
situated in the town of orford
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
happens to be deed restricted and cannot
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
be built on
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
we were easily able to determine the
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
exact line based on the town markings
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that these restrictions were
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
not violated
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the cabin was built in the town of
 
03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:36.469 align:start position:0%
and the cabin was built in the town of
wentworth

wentworth
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
recently we placed a conservation
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
easement on a large segment of our land
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it was critical to know the exact
 
03:46:43.680 --> 03:46:44.790 align:start position:0%
and it was critical to know the exact
acreage

03:46:44.790 --> 03:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
acreage
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
and location of the contiguous parcels
 
03:46:52.150 --> 03:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
per the agreement because it is 85
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
percent forested satellite images aerial
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
photos or remote sensing
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to place these
 
03:46:59.359 --> 03:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to place these
lines

03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
satellite imagery is a great technology
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
but it has its limitations
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
and in the images are only as good as
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
their resolution
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
but even high resolution images need to
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
be validated on the ground
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
to ensure the trustworthiness of the
 
03:47:19.319 --> 03:47:21.189 align:start position:0%
to ensure the trustworthiness of the
interpretation

03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
imaginary lines don't show up on
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
remotely sensed images
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
for boundary lines in a forest
 
03:47:27.760 --> 03:47:29.110 align:start position:0%
for boundary lines in a forest
especially

03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
especially
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
ground truthing has to be conducted
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
these are all examples demonstrating the
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
importance of perambulating town lines
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
our state is 82 percent or so forested
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
forest landowners in the forest product
 
03:47:44.239 --> 03:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
forest landowners in the forest product
industry

03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
manage best when sound forest management
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
plans are in place
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
accurate and well-marked boundary lines
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
on the ground
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
is foundational for the management of
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
our land
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
as well as an imperative for settling
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
boundary disputes
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
good fences make good neighbors as the
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
saying goes
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
towns have an important responsibility
 
03:48:11.429 --> 03:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
by accurately representing these
 
03:48:11.439 --> 03:48:13.189 align:start position:0%
by accurately representing these
boundaries

03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
let them not relinquish this important
 
03:48:16.239 --> 03:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
let them not relinquish this important
responsibility

03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
i oppose house bill 404 and request
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
that you vote 404 inexpedient to
 
03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:27.030 align:start position:0%
that you vote 404 inexpedient to
legislate

03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your service to
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
the state and for the opportunity to
 
03:48:31.199 --> 03:48:32.469 align:start position:0%
the state and for the opportunity to
testify

03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
i would happily entertain any questions
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
 
03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:42.309 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
representative

03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and thank you for
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
each time one of these situations has
 
03:48:53.520 --> 03:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
each time one of these situations has
come

03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
up on your property has somebody
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
had to go out and
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
and and identify the boundaries
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
and has that happen multiple times for
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
the same boundary
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
well it's it's usually me who go out
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
because i know exactly where the
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
boundaries are and also because our
 
03:49:16.479 --> 03:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
boundaries are and also because our
towns

03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
wentworth and orford do a very good job
 
03:49:22.150 --> 03:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
of maintaining these boundaries every
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
not only do they do it uh with that
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
frequency but they do it well
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know they use paint that's not gonna
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
wash off and they don't do it right
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
after a rain and
 
03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
03:49:44.800 --> 03:49:47.670 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay next i think our last speaker is
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
tom christensen is he uh
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
on the line yes mr christensen the
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct thank you mr chairman
 
03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
i am speaking in uh opposition to house
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill 404
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
many of the reasons that have already
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
been explained by many of you
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
your guests i'll give you an example
 
03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
we own a 900 acre tree farm in the town
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
of limbo
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
which happens to border the town of
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
temple and the town of greenfield
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it is on the east
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
west slope of north pack monadnock
 
03:50:36.870 --> 03:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
our immediate butter to the west on the
 
03:50:36.880 --> 03:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
our immediate butter to the west on the
mountain

03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
is a wapak national wildlife refuge
 
03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
now if you look at a google map
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
online right today you'll see
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the town boundaries are completely
 
03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:51.189 align:start position:0%
that the town boundaries are completely
wrong

03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know where they get the
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
boundaries from maybe it's gps
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
some other source but they're wrong
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
not only are they wrong the usgs is also
 
03:51:02.239 --> 03:51:02.950 align:start position:0%
not only are they wrong the usgs is also
wrong

03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
and and the peterborough quadrangle has
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
been wrong for many years
 
03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
so what do we have left to rely on
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
well we have left to rely on surveys on
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
the ground either a survey
 
03:51:18.150 --> 03:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
or the monuments that have been
 
03:51:19.670 --> 03:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
established long ago
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
by the town fathers where the boundaries
 
03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:23.670 align:start position:0%
by the town fathers where the boundaries
are

03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
so come to find out there's been a mark
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
stone in the 1800s at one corner between
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
temple greenfield and limebro one that's
 
03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
one corner i'm just speaking of our
 
03:51:36.640 --> 03:51:37.510 align:start position:0%
one corner i'm just speaking of our
property

03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's over 30 bound boundaries of
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
straight lines in the town of limebrow
 
03:51:43.920 --> 03:51:44.790 align:start position:0%
straight lines in the town of limebrow
and

03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:48.150 --> 03:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
the northwest boundary is between
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
us and greenfield and the and the waupak
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
national wildlife refuge
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
so i i would and as a result
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
we had a survey done which
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
confirmed that the boundaries which were
 
03:52:02.399 --> 03:52:02.710 align:start position:0%
confirmed that the boundaries which were
set

03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
set
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
long ago by the town fathers
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
review of all the boundaries on our
 
03:52:13.279 --> 03:52:14.389 align:start position:0%
review of all the boundaries on our
property

03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
and a permulation but they appointed a
 
03:52:18.479 --> 03:52:19.750 align:start position:0%
and a permulation but they appointed a
committee

03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
both greenfield and linebro appointed
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
to go out and find out where the heck
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
these boundaries are i don't know how
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
long it had been since they
 
03:52:30.389 --> 03:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
did it the last time but they went out
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
and sure enough they found the stones
 
03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
they found the walls they found the
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
markers so
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
and that agreed with the survey and so
 
03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
then everybody knew exactly
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
where their land was okay it required on
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
the ground survey if you do if you do a
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
gps aerial photography
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's all spruce covered you can't tell
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
what's on the ground
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's no visibility of it so you have
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
