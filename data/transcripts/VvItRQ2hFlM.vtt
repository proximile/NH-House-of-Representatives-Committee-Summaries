00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
related to uh an annual report uh on
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
special education from from the
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
department and the first uh change there
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line 26 is just putting in
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
a date that that uh annual report is
 
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.550 align:start position:0%
a date that that uh annual report is
required

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
going over to uh page
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
two um in uh number four uh we just
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
update the uh federal law reference um
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
No Child Left Behind has been uh
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
replaced by the every excuse me every
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
student succeeds act so that's um one
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
change there then uh there's a new
 
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.150 align:start position:0%
change there then uh there's a new
number

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
five and this is um quite important and
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
that um we don't really have a good
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
handle on the number of
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
IEPs that have not been signed off on by
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
parents or partially signed off on by
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
parents so there
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
is uh great possibility for students not
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
getting the services that they need
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
because of those I EP refusals and we
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't really have any good numbers on
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
them um except uh via some work that uh
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
the special education Advocate has done
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
so this indicates that we need to know
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
the number and category of those
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
refusals and also track the resolution
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
of when those um IEPs uh are resolved
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
and see what the timeline is there are
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
um refused IEPs that go for over a year
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
um and have uh great implications for
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
those children that are um in need of
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
services um and this ties
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
into um the audit um on page five there
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
is a summary um that includes um this um
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
aspect um observation one on page
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
27 relates specifically to this uh in
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
terms of uh oversight and in internal
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
controls um also on table two on page 29
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
um it is referenced um in uh that
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
um this is also referenced in terms of
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh planning and
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
organization um I think uh there was two
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
more references that I'd like to site um
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
65 did
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
indicates um that the increasingly
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
complex resolution processes and ad hoc
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
rights and finally
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
on page 88 there is option excuse me
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
observation number
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
15 um which also uh relates to the need
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
for data and Reporting so we know what's
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
going on and we if we don't know what's
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
going on we don't have the data to um
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
justify actions then um it it's hard to
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
make change we need the data and we need
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
to know what's going on
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
um I I see a number of U bills uh coming
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
next year as an uh output uh from this
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
audit and the next special education
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
audit that due by the end of the
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
year um going down to line 20 um we get
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
into the office of special
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
education and um uh I couldn't be
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
happier that we have this um office and
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh really at this point a oneperson
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
office uh in place because they are
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
actually um really helping families
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
rather than handing out manuals as other
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
organizations do um they are actually
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
helping families navigate the process
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
and work with departments uh to get
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
services so on line uh
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
20 um we talk about the need for Access
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
of information um for the special
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
education Advocate and um put into
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
statute that the department and The
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh shall enter are into a memo
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
of understanding mou uh related to uh
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
access to Student Records uh maintained
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
by the department um the current system
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
in place um for most of these records um
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
has uh historical data going back um I'd
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
say to the beginning of time but not
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
quite that long uh but um for a long
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
time and um I think theou is needed to
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
work out agreement between the
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
department and special ed
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
Advocate and then down on line
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
28 um there are reports that The
 
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate is required by law uh to
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
produce uh annually and um the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
department has agreed to work with the
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh Advocate to pull data from the
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
databases um so that the uh Advocate can
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
comply with um her duties per
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
law uh going down to the bottom of the
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
page um we get into uh Ru making and I
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
think this is um been the discussion U
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
for uh quite a while in terms of um uh
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
the rules that are in place um I have a
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
chart if anyone's interested um a spread
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
sheet of um where our rules uh
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
comply with federal law or state law um
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
and some uh explanation but I I think
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
that there are people doing a a deeper
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
dive into that do um our rule are our
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
rules actually less restrictive or more
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
restrictive than federal law there is
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
debate about that and so I think that we
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
need to take a a deeper dive into that
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's important to note that this
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
section relates to observations 9 10 and
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
11 beginning on page
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
65 um where it talks about
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
um Federal requirements
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
not implemented in rules it talks about
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh the um imposition of ad hoc rules and
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
unenforceable informational requirements
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
that compromise parents rights as we've
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
heard um again uh
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
previously um we go over to uh page
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
67 and uh the lack of controls to make
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
sure that leas are local districts are
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
timely implementing and following
 
00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:25.190 align:start position:0%
timely implementing and following
Federal

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and that um federal law
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
also requires the state to enforce and
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
monitor what's going on in those um
 
00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:37.910 align:start position:0%
monitor what's going on in those um
those

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
districts um and it goes on uh to page
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
68 um with recommendations from uh the
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
audit about um ensuring uh rules
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
accurately ref reflect and interpret all
 
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
accurately ref reflect and interpret all
federal

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that in the audit um and it
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
goes on for several more pages with
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
several important um uh Provisions um
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
included there and I would just like to
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
read that um from our administrative
 
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.710 align:start position:0%
read that um from our administrative
procedure

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
act which defines a rule as rules
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
adopted by an agency
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
to a Implement interpret or make
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
specific statutory in forced or
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
administered by an
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
agency rules are supposed to
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
reflect statute federal or state
 
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
reflect statute federal or state
statute

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
um not go beyond federal or state
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
statute so uh you know I I look at our
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
special ed statutes that we have in rsas
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I think um they're pretty uh pretty
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
thin in my view um and I think we need
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
to work um on uh really putting more
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
into statute um in uh New
 
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:12.390 align:start position:0%
into statute um in uh New
Hampshire

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
um then another very important section
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh six follows that and
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
this provides for local districts to
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
come up with their own disp
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
resolution uh procedures so it can vary
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
from District to District you know you
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
might talk to a neighbor down the street
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
about a dispute resolution and they have
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
a completely different process in their
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
local school district um it can add
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
great confusion uh for parents and
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
really makes it a freefor
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
all so what we do here is say that they
 
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.190 align:start position:0%
all so what we do here is say that they
may

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
develop you know I have a difference of
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
opinion there but um the amendment says
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
they may develop uh dispute resolutions
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
locally but those plans must be
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Department of Education
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
for review that's in line nine on page
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
three it's important that the department
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on and then in Roman
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
2 below
 
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.270 align:start position:0%
2 below
that

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
um it requires districts to sub shall
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
submit information related to these
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
alternate dispute resolution processes
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
um each year including the topic of the
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the dispute and the resolution again
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
we need data to find out if these uh
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution practices that are
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
being implemented in District a versus
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
District B Etc are actually having any
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
impact are they producing results and if
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
they are producing results Maybe we
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
should um uh look at including them in
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
statute as part of our dispute
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.190 align:start position:0%
statute as part of our dispute
resolution

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
processes um and that relates to page
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me observation number 16 on pages
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
93 and also there's a very important uh
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
reference to that on um page
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
71 so I think
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
that that's a a brief look look at the
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and how we've tried to address
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
the uh audit and the audit
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and the need to put
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
this forward as a non-main Amendment so
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
that we can get things started we cannot
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
wait another year to start addressing
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
this audit um so I uh thank you very
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
much for your time thank you very much
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli are there questions
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
cordelli for um um for your time this
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
morning on this but I want to pick on
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
something you just said um you just said
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
quote it's important that the department
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on and and I want to
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
read directly from the um the audit
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
report yep that that came out um
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
recently on this very subject um right
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
27 and there's similar
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
um statements uh found in the audit
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
report but what it says on um on page 27
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
is um Department of Education oversight
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
of internal controls was ineffective
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
management did not adequately design
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
implement or monitor special education
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process controls
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
existing controls were limited informal
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistently updated and clearly
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
documented or communicated instead
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
management not the legislature
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
management relied significantly on staff
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge to carry out
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
operation operations this was ineff uh
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
insufficient to ensure consistent and
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
effective operations or reduce
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
organizational knowledge loss risk these
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
were known risks during the audit period
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
which likely existed for many years
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
there were no strategies plans policies
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
or procedur procedures for supporting
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
decisions and managing dispute
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
resolution processes records and
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
databases supporting processes were
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
inadequate and staff turnover occurred
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
all of which contributed to operational
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
defic deficiencies and knowledge loss so
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
what did this management incompetence
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
lead to it led to and this again is from
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the audit report non-compliance
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
with or unenforced requirements at the
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
state and local level untimeliness
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
untimeliness with dispute resolution
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
process time limits and related
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements unmitigated risks
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
such as conflicts of interest fraud and
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
waste unaddressed longstanding issues
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
identified in Prior evaluations or
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
audits resource constraints limited and
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
inaccurate output data and a lack of
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
public transparency so when when I read
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
that and and that the that the leading
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
contributing factors to the state's
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
complete failure in um in in having a
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient and um and and appropriate uh
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution prop um process for
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
special education falls on management
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
not on the legislature is there a
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
question yeah in in in fact yes in fact
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the the um the
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
observation review it cites 20
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
observations 16 of them saying no
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
legislative action is
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
required and on the ones that uh that
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
you have cited specifically such as
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
observation number nine um it says no OB
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
no legislative action is require
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
required so why do um do do you feel
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
that legislative action is required uh
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
when uh when it's it's very clear from
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
the report that this is a failure on the
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
management um I'm
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
still was was that a question I guess
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
leg action why do you feel legislative
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
action is required when the failure
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
clearly rests um on the shoulders of
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
management I think that um uh maybe you
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh go a little bit uh far with uh
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
placing uh blame for the problems in
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
special education um I think that uh um
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
there are uh um many uh contributing
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
factors to the problems we've seen in
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
special education uh
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we've tried to address some with
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
legislation this this performance audit
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
and next let me give you some background
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of people who haven't
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
seen this but this started about five
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
years ago with a bill I put in for um
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
Shifting the burden of proof in due
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
process hearings from the uh parent to
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
the school district someone on the
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to replace the bill
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
with a St study
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee so I did an amendment and
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
added the study committee to my bill
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
which passed and got signed into law we
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
had the study committee um it was
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
chaired by former Senator Reagan um I
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
think uh chairman lad was on that study
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee as well uh uh chairman uh
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
Reagan happened to also be chair of the
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit committee
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the time and so one of our
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that study
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee was performance
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
audit um and that also led to
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to create the office of the
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
special education advocate so um looking
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
at our statutes also
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
um they are quite thin and do not uh
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
reflect What's um in the rules in many
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
cases uh and neither does federal law so
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
I think we have to if we're going to
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
have things in rules they have to be
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
based on statute federal or state so we
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
have to look at both the rules and the
 
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.870 align:start position:0%
have to look at both the rules and the
um

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
statutes um in terms of the department
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you yourself read uh about the uh the
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
turnover um we've heard about um whether
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
um additional uh Staffing is required in
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
the department uh in the specialed area
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
um and that is a legislative um option
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's available in terms of the next
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
budget that we need to look at um so I
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that you and as you said
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
also this goes back years um you know I
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
remember hearing about problems um when
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
I started in 2012 so this is uh nothing
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
new new but we have to start really
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
taking a hard look at things and I think
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
we are trying to do that with this um uh
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses things in the
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
performance audit and hopefully there'll
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
be more legislation coming next year
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
also that will address things that are
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the uh next special
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
education audit because this this
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
performance audit was just about due
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
process there's a lot more out there and
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
we need to dig into that and find
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions follow up quickly quick thank
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair so um you you you
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
you started off saying that that maybe I
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
went a little bit too far so I was
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
reading directly from the report uh the
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
the the qu I guess the two parts of this
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
question did the report go too far is
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying and then the
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
second part is the specifically the the
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
the first piece that I read was
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education oversight of
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
internal controls was ineffective
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
management did not adequately design
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
implement or monitor special education
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process controls
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
controls are the rules so if the if the
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
department is
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
ineffective at at at implementing and
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules how does changing
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
matter so did the report go too far is
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying and how does
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
changing the rules make any
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
difference uh no the report did not go
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
too far in terms of identifying issues
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
um and certainly there are uh issues in
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
the department that need to be addressed
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
but um also I think that this is built
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
up over time with
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
people well meaning rules and uh reports
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
and um manuals maybe that um the process
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is so complex maybe we
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
need to simplify things a little bit um
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
and that falls on the department and us
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
with local process for for due process
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
resolution um in addition to State um we
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
have we have state processes um uh
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
neutral conferences for instance um
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
we've had three neutral conferences in
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
three years maybe we should simplify
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
things um to make it easier for parents
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
so U will making things simpler uh help
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of management controls in the
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
department I think so but part of that
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
also falls on us and um not just uh good
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
intentions but it's time for good
 
00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:07.630 align:start position:0%
intentions but it's time for good
actions

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
also thank you very much I have I have a
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
question for you um having done a little
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
bit of work on this myself I'm I'm very
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
very concerned about our database that
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
we have at the Department of
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
Education and if the special education
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate is trying to find information
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the aggregate of what's occurred in X
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
year going back back back and we know
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
there's well hundreds of thousands of
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
Records in that that
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
database and it's not accessible due to
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of the Privacy rights of those that
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
have IEPs in there who may now be 30y
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
olds adults so my my concern is would
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the local level and due process being a
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
little bit different in many of these
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
districts how much of this information
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
is now located not just in that database
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
but at the local
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
level uh I I think quite a bit um
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
because I it is my understanding there
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
are even uh a few districts do not
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
participate in that
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
database um which is an issue and I I
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
think that the department is looking to
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
address uh the shortcomings um of that
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
database um it was something that I had
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to put into the amendment
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
um but uh based on indications that the
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
department is looking at addressing um
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
those problems um I did not um but uh
 
00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:39.799 align:start position:0%
the special ed Advocate is charged in
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
law for um going into the districts and
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
having access to the local records um
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
themselves um this uh was trying to
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
relate just to that database that you
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
described that has thousands and
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
thousands of historical records in it
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
and um maybe records that are not needed
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
for the current work of The Advocate um
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that's we were close to agreement on
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
specific language but um in order to uh
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
meet deadlines um we left it with u anou
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
to be signed um related to that by the
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
department with the advocate thank you
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman U Mr
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I have three questions for
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
clarification if I
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
mayell thank you for taking the
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh on page three uh I'm
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the line nine that you
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
identify where it talks about the local
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
school district creating a plan that
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
what um that's what we try and address
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
here and the plans they have are to be
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
provided shall be provided to the
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
department along with uh the timeline
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
the topic of the dispute and the
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
resolution if any so that the department
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
can capture that data and see if um
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
those processes that are in place are
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
working or not but thank you but going
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
the same question so two're going to the
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
same question but if you're going back
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the start of that 789 it talks about
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the local school district can
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
create their own and just give it the de
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't they don't have to be
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with anything
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
particularly and doe May provide
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
assistance of ask but if not it's just
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
another document going forward that's
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
different from one school district uh to
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
another um in in the amendment we change
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
that to the the plan uh shall be uh
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Department for review
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the department shall provide
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to the school
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
district yeah in develop if they ask for
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
it and implementing doesn't say they
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like creating a plan and
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
going to the doe and just put it in
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
another file the second question I may
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have three um thank you and
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is why I don't understand uh I'm on
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
page three reverent cordelli uh lines uh
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
two and three to talk about the state
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
board rules and the federal minimum and
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
state statute and I understand you're
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the need to have uh
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
structure that has um statute Follow by
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
rules uh but my question is four things
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
that are currently in place now today
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
that are providing educational special
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
Educational Services does that mean then
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
that services that youngsters are
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
getting today may be reduced
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh I do not believe so no there nothing
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
in here about um reducing um uh or
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
changing or um uh eliminating um rules
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
um at this
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
point that same point Mr chair thank you
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
but it said they can adop rule that
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
exceed state of federal minimum I got
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
that but my question is if they already
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
are exceeding services are exceeding
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
state or federal minimum does that mean
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
this passes that those youngster service
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
has been R reduced no it does not no um
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
and every 10 years the department um
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
re-evaluates rules and at that point um
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
when that comes up um we could take a
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
look at that but I think in the meantime
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that our state
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
statutes also reflect what we want uh to
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
be going on um um for instance I could I
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
2015 the um
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
legislature passed on the consent
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
calendar and signed into law repealing
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
of the facilitated IEP team
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
meetings but they're still going on
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
so we have to make sure that state
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
statutes uh reflect what we want to
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
happen uh are there too many due process
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
options you know we've heard that in
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
testimony when we're going over the
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
audit report I think so um such as the
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
neutral conference um we have to align
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
rules with statute and where our
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
statutes are short and do not reflect um
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh best practices and what we want to
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
happen uh to Aid families then we have
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
to address that legislatively as well
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
as administratively with rules I I would
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
just comment to that do you have one
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
more question I do can we jump to that
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
one quickly because I we got a lot of
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
people wanting to speak okay I was
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
responding to the audit which said
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
clearly we aren't doing best practices
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
that's not happening that's pretty clear
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh my last question if I may is was this
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
were these amendments generated uh and
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
created by you by the doe or by a
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
different organization uh um this is
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the 14th or 15th draft of an
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
amendment um that have been reviewed by
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
four or five people uh in the department
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
including the Deputy Commissioner okay
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
um and the special Advocate um legal
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
staff in the department um so it has
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
been a uh collaborative effort uh to
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
arrive at uh Amendment 1811 thank you
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I might add this special
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
education Advocate was also involved in
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
this process thank you sir yeah further
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh due to
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
the number of cards which we have here
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
we have about 25 cards here uh I'm going
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
to limit limit the length of speaking to
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
three minutes if we in fact start
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
rolling on here too far I'll have to
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
even reduce that but so initially we're
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to start with a three minute time
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
limit and I'd like to invite up Bonnie
 
01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:46.630 align:start position:0%
limit and I'd like to invite up Bonnie
Dunham

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
morning I just I think I turned it off
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
I'm terribly sorry um could we start the
 
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.630 align:start position:0%
I'm terribly sorry um could we start the
clock

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
clock
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
over than I'll give you seven seconds
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
thanks um so I'm here as a mom um and I
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
live in mirac New Hampshire both my son
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
and I benefited from the protections and
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire rules and it's sad
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would mean that
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
future children with disabilities and
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
their families won't have the same
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
rights and protections that we did it is
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
unbelievably disappointing that an
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
amendment this important was introduced
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
with just days notice and most parents
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
didn't even know that it existed so much
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
for PR parent involvement every other
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
time our state rules were reviewed it
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
was done through a thoughtful and very
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
open process number of years ago when
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
our statute and rules were revised a 33
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
person work group including parents
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislators SCH School Personnel um
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
reviewed them in detail line by line it
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
was led by Senator Nancy Styles and it
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
was re and consensus was reached on
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
almost everything um RSA 186c says that
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's hereby declared to be the policy of
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
the state that the rights of children
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and their parents are
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
protected this amendment does the exact
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
opposite of that it it defies the whole
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
purpose of RSA 186c it takes away rights
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
from children and their parents idea was
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
never intended to be a sealing it was a
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
floor it was the starting point States
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
can't go below the minimum requirements
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
in idea um but they are expected to
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
develop rules that comply with idea as
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does while reflecting the
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
state's values and I don't believe that
 
01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
the audit intended to engage in
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
wholesale dismantling of special
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
education rights um RSA 186c gives the
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the responsibility to
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
make rules that implement the statute
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
which is why they're more detailed they
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
have to adopt rules related to
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
developing IEPs approving and monitoring
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
programs due process hearings
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility determination surrogate
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
parents and other matters um related to
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
complying with a statute so that's
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what they did um for example in
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
defining a child with a dis ility RSA
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
186c says the child must be evaluated by
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
a school district according to rules
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
adopted by the State Board of Education
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's it it doesn't say who evaluates
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
them the requirements for the
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
evaluations how long it can take the
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
rights of parents to participate and who
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
decides whether the child is a child
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education and how
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
that happens so of course they're more
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
detailed the New Hampshire rules support
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
meaningful parent involvement in the
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
process they make the process more
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
efficient proactive and clear they
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
protect students from hiring and they
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
provide accountability and trans and
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
transparency they include clear
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
timelines 10 days 14 days not a
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable time or enough time who knows
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
what that might mean um they don't cost
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
anything they're a sound business
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
practice they require leas to provide
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
parents with evaluation and assessment
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
reports at least 5 days before a meeting
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
so they don't show up at a meeting get
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
handed a packet of evaluation results be
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
expected to review them and
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
simultaneously use that information are
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
you kidding me that's three that that's
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes and 7 Seconds did you did
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
me you did start it over your your
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
time's up okay um I submitted written

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
leus I thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
I understand your concerns I do note
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
that in here it say provided that in no
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
case the State Board uh adopt a role
 
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
that exceeds and to me that's a future
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the future that they don't exceed not
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
that they retroactively take out rules
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
but the other thing
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
is um unless the rule is specifically
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute and I believe the
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
to create those statutes which there
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't time for this year for this you
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
know since the came to come up with all
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
those statutes but would you be willing
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
or interested since you have a huge
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
bunch of information of what those are
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
in helping to figure out what statutes
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
need to be put in next
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
year in order to um codify all of those
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
things so that we're not losing anything
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the future so first of all in terms
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
of everything we have now being safe the
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
next time the rules are reviewed then it
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
goes away so we've bought a little time
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
but that's that's not the answer I would
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
suggest having a committee a diverse
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee come together before you
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
dismantle special education rights and
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
see what needs to be added to the
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
statute why not just start with saying
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
everything in the rules is now in the
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
statute next year we'll decide what to
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
get rid
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
of thank you very much representative
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
amendment section
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
five right it is stunningly dangerous
 
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.870 align:start position:0%
five right it is stunningly dangerous
for

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%

families mind-bogglingly bad thank you
further

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much I want to
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
remind the public that we're here not
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
testifying on the original 340 which was
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
basically electronic communications with
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
a parent we're talking about an
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to that so let's keep it to
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning members of the
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
committee chairman La thank you for
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
having me I'm the my name is Karen
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
disability right Center and I'm here to
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
testify in strong opposition to the non-
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment that's before you my
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to focus on Section
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
Five which is the section that Bonnie
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
Dunham was just addressing and not and
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
but you shouldn't take absence of
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
comments as agreeing that the rest of
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment is fine it's just not with
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
so little time there wasn't time to
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
really analyze the entire Amendment um
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
we already have in place a process by
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
which all administrative agencies rules
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
are vetted by the legis ISL so that is
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
what the joint legislative committee on
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rules does that's their
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
job they are in place to make sure that
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
when a state agency chooses to amend its
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
rules that it complies with public
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
notice and opportunities for public
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
participation and that the rules are
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
within the authority of the state agency
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
and if they are not within the state
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
agency's Authority then the committee
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
may enter an objection a fi a
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
preliminary and a final objection and
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
basically take the agency to task to
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the authority
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that the rules that they are
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
promulgating are in the best interest of
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
the public and meet all the other
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
requirements so the current education
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
rules as Miss dham testified yes do some
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
of them exceed the federal minimums they
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
do and it's permissible and J car has
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
found that that the agency was acting in
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
accordance with its Authority and these
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
rules that exceed the federal minimum
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
are incredibly important to enable
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
parents to participate in their
 
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.390 align:start position:0%
parents to participate in their
children's

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
education when children are evaluated
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
whether to determine their eligibility
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
for education or to determine their
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
continuing eligibility and what they
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
need to get a free appropriate education
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of evaluations that
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
are done and parents get a stack of
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation reports that are written by
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
experts and they need time to review
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
those to understand to meaningfully
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
participate in the process this is just
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
one rule that exceeds okay our rules
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
give parents that opportunity this
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
amendment would strip parents of that
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity or at the very least make it
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
impossible for the Department to
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
promulgate another rule that would give
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
parents the opportunity to review
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
evaluations before a meeting just just
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
one um with unless the legislature
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
passed a statute enabling this rule to
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
exist this rule is completely within the
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
purview of Education it's been vetted by
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people hundreds of hours and
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
was determined to be within the
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
authority of the state agency other
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
things that our rules do our rules
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
require timelines when a parent is
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about their children's
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
education program and wants to have a
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
team meeting our rules require once they
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
receive a written notice for the team to
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
get back to the parent within 14 days is
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
that 14-day period required in federal
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
law no is it within the authority of the
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
agency and within keeping of Our
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
obligation under current state and
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
federal law to provide a faap yes I
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
guess my time is up
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.239 --> 01:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
technology got a l are there
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions rep San
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
Luna thank thank you very much uh Mr
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much um um M
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg for taking my question do do
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
you do you think that um that that um
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know reducing these um these rights
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
and stripping parents of Rights and
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
stripping um um special education
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
students of of Rights would um would I
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
mean does that make it easier I guess
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
for the um for the Department of
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
Education to uh avoid findings like this
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
and and to comply with like less well
 
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I actually
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't see that at all I think it makes
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
it easier for the dep Department of
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
Education to monitor whether parents are
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
adequately involved and whether and
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
whether the education process is
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
continuing the way it ought to be under
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
federal law and to meet our federal
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
obligations because it provides
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
safeguards for parents along the way to
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
get notice of Team meetings to negotiate
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
when these should be to participate
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
adequately the department has to my
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge this is not really the problem
 
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
with the Department the department may
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
need more staff to implement policies I
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
think what I heard is that there was a
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
lot of turnover I don't think stripping
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%

represent

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%

01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
you for being here uh for your testimony
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
I think I have a basic understanding of
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
the problem that you bring up I want to
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
do a little more research to help better
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
understand whether we're dealing with an
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
is something to do with executive rulem
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would fall under sort of a Chevron
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Doctrine issue or whether there was a
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
was established in state and federal law
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
where certain authorities were granted
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking that can be legally
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
exceeded by the executive so can you
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
either now or or sometime provide me
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
with some specific references to law
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
that I can look at uh for this I I want
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand boy when you
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
said Chevron I think I had a law school
 
01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:18.390 align:start position:0%
said Chevron I think I had a law school
PTSD

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
PTSD
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
moment sure uh just are you looking for
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
you want to so our current law um
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
provides author in various places for
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to undergo
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
rule making so are you looking for those
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
particular Provisions yes exactly okay
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
so I think I can I can send you a quick
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
email that identifies what those
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions are thank you I appreciate
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
that let me just write myself a note to
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
do it repres laus do you have a
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you and I'm going to I'm
 
01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
going to let you finish writing that
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
thank thank
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
you okay so it's sort of a follow on to
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
what I had asked earlier is that I don't
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
see that since since I don't see that
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually taking away rules
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
we already have it's saying in the
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
future we can't pass rules so when we go
 
01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
and re-evaluate and redo our rules so my
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
is since we need to specifically
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
authorize them by Statute and I think
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's the point of this is that we need
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
to authorize those rules then you look
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
at the rules that are not currently
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute and write us
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
something that explains why those
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
particular rule you know what the
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
purpose why they're good so that we can
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
come up with statute for next year to
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
cover those rules I think that's the
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
point of this legislation so I actually
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
think that all the rules we have in
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
place are already authorized under the
 
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
current statute and I think that what
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
the way that our government is
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
structured in terms of administrative
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and the role of administrative
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
agencies and the legislature is that the
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislature whether it's federal or
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
state delegates rulemaking Authority and
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
implementation authority to the agency
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that is recognized as having the
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
expertise in that area because you know
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature is called upon to pass
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
overall overarching policies in a wide
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
range of areas right right not any one
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
of us can be have expertise in that such
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
a wide range of areas and so we have
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies that are in
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
place to adopt rules with a whole public
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
input um with public input requirements
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so I question whether it's really
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the for the legislature
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
to get into the minutia of every single
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
right and that I mean you if you've I
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've seen the rules that
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
currently exist um but there I I someone
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
here is going to like flash this book at
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
you but um which incl so many people
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
have them um I mean this would you would
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
be looking at using this legislative
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
process to get into the minutia of the
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
development of a evaluations and an
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation for you know every single
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
child in the state and then the other
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
thing to keep in mind is that sometimes
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
things change so polic other policies
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
that also impact a child's education
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
might change in other laws so for
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
example like your committee might not be
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
involved in Restraint and seclusion of
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities another
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
committee might and there's another and
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
there are now laws about that those also
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
impact students with disabilities with
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
there we have in our rules now a
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
Prohibition against the use of aversives
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
but you know that you know that that
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
preexisted the the current the most
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
recent change in the law and rules are
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
meant to be nimble they can you know if
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
there needs to be an emergency you know
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed on
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis it can be so I really
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know theoretically would it be
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
possible representative leus you know
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
anything is possible I just don't think
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's really well advised to do that
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
represent we have to really move on
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're really short in time here
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair and
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you m Mr Rosenberg for being here
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
and advocating for your constituents uh
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
based upon this report that we've all
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
received and uh have been briefed on by
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
the LBA on it the daming report
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the management uh of the um
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process would it be
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
your position that based upon the issues
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
that been brought before us in this
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
report that it would be more prudent to
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh rather than dealing with this 11th
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hour Amendment uh to have an actual
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
study committee to look at this and be
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
more thorough in looking at this and on
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
the reports and the recommendations Etc
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
and then come forward with uh
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in the future would that be
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
your position to have a further study on
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
this on the implications of this and how
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
it might relate to legislative
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives thank you for the question
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
and I have a really short answer for you
 
01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:19.790 align:start position:0%
and I have a really short answer for you
yes

01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank from from this point for what I'm
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
going to ask committee members ask one
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
question and we're going to pass it on
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
to somebody else okay so further
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
perel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question there's we've
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony now about um uh
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
parents rights students rights being
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
eliminated but I'm confused I don't know
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
if rights are established through the
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
rul making process where how is it that
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
parents rights are being removed I don't
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
I see this as a future
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
um section five in particular as um
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
using it for future rules unless the
 
01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:05.719 align:start position:0%
rule is specifically authorized by
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
Statute so if you even taking that
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
reading of it I mean I'm not 100% sure
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that reading is accurate but let's
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
assume that that's true and that it
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
would only address future rules then you
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
are then we are on the precipice of
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
taking away some very very important
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
rights that are Central to a parent's
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
ability to participate and a child's
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
ability to secure a free appropriate

public education so I if if there is an
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
if this committee feels that there is a
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to adopt some more specific law
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
around the delivery of special education
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
for children that could be done in a in
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
the next legislative session and then
 
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
you know and and then it could be dealt
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
with in that way without putting these
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
rules at in Jeopardy or potential
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking these number of
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions my one um representative cell
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
indicated this bill was pretty much
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the Department of
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
Education and all their Staffing and he
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
presented it um however his
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the part about minimum
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
standard is that nothing will be lost
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
for parents and students as we go
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
forward is that your interpretation I'm
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100% sure about that I mean I
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
haven't had very much time with this
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment nor has anyone but I I am not
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure about that thank you further
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
Beville morning everyone thank you for

Hampshire I want to thank repres
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
resentative cordelli and those people
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
who have worked on this amendment to
 
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
quickly try to get it in front of you uh
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
there are problems with it uh rather
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
than uh concentrating on Those portions
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are broken let's concentrate on the
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
pieces that work such for example in
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
section one it grants parents of all
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
school districts access to their
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
children's proposed IEPs and written
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
prior noce in electronic word searchable
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
PDF format I'm in the marac school
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
district I have had the benefit of
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
always getting a copy electronically I
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
can do word searches we can quickly
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
reference it this is a benefit I think
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
section one is good section two provides
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
for greater accountability based on the
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
March 2024 audit report in determining
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
special education revenues and
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures by the school district
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
along with better annual reporting of
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
progress and compliance for special ed
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
students across New Hampshire this is
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
good this is something we need to be
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
able to do is based on the audit report
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
hold the Department of Education
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
accountable for Revenue
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures grants those things so that
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
there is clear transparency on that
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
sections three and four provide better
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
Clarity for the reporting requirements
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Education provide
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
access to its nessus database and other
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
information within the department to the
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
newly created office of special
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
education advocate in order to better
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
support that office in its statutory
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
requirements to track and resolve
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
resolve uh resolutions of Ip disputes
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
sections 1 through four are excellent
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
here I understand what representative
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli is trying to do with Section
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
Five um he is right but because there is
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
confusion and inflammatory feelings on
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
this I think that section should be
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
stricken no rule grants greater rights
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
than statutes that's where we're here
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
rules create the process for how
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
statutes are done uh J clar has no teeth
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
it needs to have the ability to if it
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't like a rule stop a agency from
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
doing that Jake does not have the teeth
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
to do that right now I think that's what
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
they're trying to accomplish there uh
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
section six talks about creating yet
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
another um dispute resolutions we have
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
too many dispute resolutions processes
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
now we as the report recommended we need
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
to trim those Downs thank you very much
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.109 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
representa

01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
leus thank you um thank you for taking
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
my question there are two fives on here
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's the five that's in parentheses
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
that comes after the two three four then
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
we have that five which has nothing to
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
do with rules and whatever and then we
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
down farther there is a number five in
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
section two Roman numeral 2 which has
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
the rule making Etc so I'm
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
wondering you did not address
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
the in parentheses 5 up on line 10 there
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
down to the number five under Roman
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 and so I was wondering what
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
you thought of
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
those um again your committee time is
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
short I know that you guys are trying to
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
get as much possible done I'm trying to
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
focus on what representative cordelli
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
and you guys have got right in this
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
let's get it done uh I think the idea of
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
Leno's uh study committee I think about
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
looking at these we need to be able to
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
address this there's other legislation
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
before the committee I mean before the
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislature right now to completely
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
revamp education 200 education 1100 that
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be be addressed I was with
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
Bonnie in that hot summer in 2005 2006
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
where that um Bonnie took notes copious
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
notes I still have all of them she
 
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on the but it was not a
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
third parents a third legislators
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative style was there we had
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
three or four representatives there and
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
25 paid School administrators I didn't
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
get to pay get paid there uh the head of
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
the de education School charter school
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
was there a homeschooler mom a couple of
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
other peoples me and Bonnie we were it
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
and we were outvoted as the what
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
consensus for the rewriting of idea 2004
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to solve that
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
today we couldn't solve it over an
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
entire summer so uh again I'm looking at
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
the pieces that work today strike
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
sections five and six I think what he's
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
written in one through four meet two
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
things parts of the March 2024 audit
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
report and the statutory
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the newly created
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
office of education Advocate she has
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
gotten nothing nothing from the
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for the requests
 
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
that are required by Statute and her
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
hands are tied there are angry parents
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
asking what's going on why can't she not
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
staff her office why are we not getting
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
answers why can she not look at the
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
databases that are required by Statute
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
this to me starts opening the door on
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
those we solve the rest of the problems
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the legislature later can can I just
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
get a clarification ma which which was
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
my original question which five are you
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
talking I'm talking about the five that
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
said Special Rule making amend RSA 18616
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
number eight so when you say strike five
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's the five you're talking yes ma'am
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
because I understand exactly what
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative is cordelli is trying to
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
do but because people are inflamed that
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
it means something else let's just
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
strike it and move on got it just than
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
representor pno thank you and thank you
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes ma'am um it's
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
on my understanding that these special
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
education rules are up for review in
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
2025 is it possible that section 5 could
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
be proactive in terms of um evaluating
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
those rules when they come up
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
again I think it would be I think
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
because it is so so I had worked with
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli on on changing
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
the language of this to meet what was
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
part of observation number 11 starting
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
in page 73 talks about the
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
unaccountability in here and what it
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
needed to say was that any kind of rule
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed the department authority
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
of federal and state law that's what it
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
needed to be said it didn't rather than
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
trying to solve it on the back of a
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
Denny's napin right now let's just
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
strike it that's what I'm trying to say
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
I do think you're right we need to move
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%

education um we are here in opposition
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh as written the basis of
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
our opposition begins with the
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
Amendments brought forward that will
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
have a profound impact on New
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children youth and families
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
the mission of our association is to
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that we provide high quality
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
education to our most complex students
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
and that we are a voice for equity and
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
excellence and
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
education when we we looked at the um
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
testimony our members brought forward um
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
several factors that I would like to
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
summarize for you first we'd like to
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
begin with the importance of the
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
legislative audit of special education
 
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
that's currently in process while the
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
findings of phase one of this audit have
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
been released we would strongly
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
encourage policy makers to have a
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
complete set of data and a comprehensive
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
set of recommendations prior to Bringing
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
forward any legislation members of our
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
association support and understand the
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
importance of the audit and would
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage a more deliberate
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
process while waiting for a
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report and
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
findings secondly we'd like to address
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
the removal of language from the New
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire special education rules as it
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
pertains to exceeding state and federal
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements unless um
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
Statute New Hampshire has worked
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
extremely hard to ensure that students
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
with IEPs are receiving high quality
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
services starting with the referral
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
process diagnosis writing and monitoring
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
I APS all of which have parent and
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
family engagement if this bill were to
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
pass children youth and their families
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
would lose many aspects of the special
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
education process that they have come to
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
expect and deserve the New Hampshire
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
standards for students with disabilities
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
function as a guide for educators and
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
provide the much needed protections
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
afforded to New Hampshire's most complex
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
and vulnerable Children and Youth as we
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
drill down into the specifics of the
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
amendment it's filled with language that
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
is vague raises some questions and in
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
some instances is not in the best
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
interest of children and their families
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the educational communities that
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
serve them with the limited time I have
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'll will point out a few questions that
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
our members have brought forward for
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.270 align:start position:0%
our members have brought forward for
your

01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%

01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of vague generalities
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
about um specific services and rights
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%

amendment were to pass can you give me
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
one specific example please sure the
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
right now there are are several
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
different areas in which we exceed
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
Federal rules um we require additional
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
um parental consents our ref referral
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
process goes above and beyond what the
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
federal government requires when it
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
comes to evaluating kids we have um lure
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
requir ments that are above and beyond
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements um our IEP uh team
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
composition um components of the IEP so
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
we in a variety of areas I could go on
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
um but those are some examples that
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
really do impact
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
kids further questions representative uh
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
dry thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
question uh the previous um person Mr
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
Bell talked about sections of this that
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
would actually help in addressing the
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
concerns brought up in this large audit
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I feel like if we don't address
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
those we'll be kicking the can down the
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
road do would you agree with some of the
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
things in here that would help to
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
address this specifically right now I
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
think there's always room for
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
improvement in any system um and we're
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
happy to work with other stakeholders to
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
bring forward more um appropriate and
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
efficient processes um like I said we
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
value the audit um when you do some
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
self-reflection that's always an
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
important thing and there's always room
 
01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
important thing and there's always room
for

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
improvement um and and so yes thank you
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock then represent
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
I'll only keep one um this bill that was
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the doe and brought forth
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
by represent cordelli uh in item five
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
seven talks about the minimum standards
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh now federal state his belief was that
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
nothing would happen to student services
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
right now is that your belief as well
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the way we interpreted it I
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
mean like this came at us pretty quickly
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
um and so our members um did not
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
interpret it that way thank you thank
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair represent leus yes thank
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question a
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
previous speaker had said that they felt
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
that all of the roles that are there do
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
in fact follow uh are in fact authorized
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
by Statute I'm just wondering if you
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
would if you are a the same opinion that
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
they are currently authorized by Statute
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge yes thank
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome like
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
Bernier hi my name is Caitlyn Bernier I
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
am here um I live in marac New Hampshire
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm here as a parent of a child in
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
the special ed um and I I just wanted to
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
point out um a couple things that uh New
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does that um the idea does not
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
include so New Hampshire rules prohibit
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
the use of um adversive including the
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
use of noxus myths denying a child food
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
drink or contact with parents electrical
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
stimul ation and unnecessary restraint
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
none of these are prohibited by the idea
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
and at least one school in a neighboring
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
state has routinely used electrical
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
shock to attempt to control kids um so
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's not that's one one thing there um
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also requires uh parents
 
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
consent at each step in the special ed
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
process um and this includes transition
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
planning Beginning by age 14 instead of
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
16 which is the age that the idea
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
requires um and so um
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
sb340 would undo Decades of work by
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
families Advocates and Educators in many
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
areas New Hampshire just clarifies the
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
idea when we do more it doesn't mean
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
more costly or more cumbersome in most
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
case it just means more clear more
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of parent and school
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and more likely to maintain
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the special ed process
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
um this amendment would hurt our
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
children and our families and the
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships that we have with those
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
schools and those families and how that
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
reflects New Hampshire that's all are
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
there questions yes representative pel
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
being here and for taking my question
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'm confused does this bill say anywhere
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
or this amendment say anywhere that um
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
state law cannot exceed federal law so
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
where it says that provided that in no
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
case shall the State Board adopt a rule
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
that exceeds the state or federal
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
minimum requires unless the rule is um
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by Statute that
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
was the part that we were talking about
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
on page three I think that's what it
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
is thank you I um I would read this as
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
saying um shall not ad shall adopt wait
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
no case in no case shall the State Board
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
adopt rle that exceed state or federal
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
minimum do you think that the or in
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
there would allow for exceeding federal
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
statute in New Hampshire statute yeah I
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
think that um the wording needs to be
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
more clear and concise uh so that people
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
aren't um uh perceiving it in different
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
ways so we don't go down this path any
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
further I want to advise the
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee our statutes do state that you
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
can go beyond federal and state in
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
regard to special there's no need to ask
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
any more questions that that's in
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
statute and it's for all areas of
 
01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:01.589 align:start position:0%
statute and it's for all areas of
special

01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
education so no need to travel that road
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
any further we know that um from the
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh who is next with a hand up
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
here that's good thank you very much
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Michaela deer is Michaela
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
still here she had to be out here by 10

01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Trumble see we
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
that good morning how's we today that's
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
good thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
David Trumble I'm from the town of wear
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
and I oppose this bill specifically the
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
part about the regulations and how they
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
relate to statutes the Department of
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
Education released a document it's 17
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
Pages it's called new standards in
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
excess chart I urge you all to just
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
Google it and find it it gives you an
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
idea of the types of things that they
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of in 2025 when they
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
rewrite the rules I'm going to walk
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
through a couple different legal
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
analysises first is that the statute
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
proposed says unless specifically
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
authorized but statutes right General
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
policy regulations do go into the
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
specific details for instance federal
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
law says you have to have Specialists
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
who are trained to work in the special
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
education field on this list the 17-page
 
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
list there's three different places they
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
want to write the Specialists out of the
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
rules another example that's a problem
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
with this proposal here is it only says
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute the federal
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
government has a long list of federal
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
regulations in the cfrs that talk about
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
how special ed rules will be implemented
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
those rules have the effect of law if
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
you don't include that in this statute
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying if the federal
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
government went through the work of
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
telling you exactly what the details are
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do those in New
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's not mentioned in
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
federal statute why would the federal
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
government go through all those details
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the statute they set out the broad
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
General guidelines for example they say
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents have to be given notice on time
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
so they can participate the regulations
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
break it down this this bill here says
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
unless the federal law gave all those
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
details the number of days out it would
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
go this should be a this should be it
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
disregarded completely but the fact it
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't consider the Federal Regulations
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
as another legal deficiency third is the
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
word or in this list the 17-page list
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
they have categorical Aid because the
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
state requires categor catastrophic Aid
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh the federal government does
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
not so they want to get rid of
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid because it's not
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
required it says not not specifically
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
authorized by federal or state minimum
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
standards so if it's not in the FED
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
standards they're willing to get rid of
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid even though State
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
Statute requires it the types of people
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
who will be hurt by this bill medically
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
fragile children children who are two
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
and a half who hope to have a smooth and
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
effective transition when they start
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
getting services at the age of three
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
parents right to be informed on time the
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
role of Specialists including parent
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
professionals who are mentioned in the
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
federal regs the documentation of
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
services that goes on repeatedly that's
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
how parents know that their children are
 
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
getting those Services they need there's
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
numerous examples but those are three I
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
was say constitutional deficiencies in
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
this that statutes give General
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
regulations give details they don't
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
consider the code of federal regulations
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
and this word or means that even if
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
State Statute requires it if the federal
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
government does they can write it out of
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
our rules thank you Bo right on the
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
money any questions for
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
David yes represent Woodcock first thank
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%

you quoted uh
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes can you repeat that my low text
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
missed it okay great it's called New
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standards in excess chart I
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
just Googled it last night it's 17 pages
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
and it walks through everything that the
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
department of Ed thinks is in excess
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
which tells me this is what they want to
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
get rid of next year
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
just is that out of the doe website yes
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
right on the doe website well it's it's
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's a a Google address but it's a doe

document so we have copies here so thank

represent belshire thank you thank you
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for being here to
 
01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
offer your testimony I
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
have I have a little bit of concern with
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
a couple things but there's one thing
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
you said that I I don't fully understand
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
I want to get into maybe I
 
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstood um you suggested I think
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
that this legislation or rather this
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
amendment would result in the um the
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
repeal or elimination of catastrophic
 
01:46:53.229 --> 01:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
Aid despite it already being in New
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
statute and I don't really understand
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
that okay uh thank you for the question
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative belter my reading of this
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
law says that provided that in no case
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education adopt a
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
rule that exceeds state or federal
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements unless the rule is
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by Statute in
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
this chart it has one column for state
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement and one column for
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
federal minimum requirement in the chart
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
it mentions catastrophic Aid because it
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
says it catastrophic G is required by
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
State Statute but not by federal statute
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's on its list of things
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
that could be eliminated in 2025 because
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh a rule that would exceed
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
state or federal minimum standards so
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
other it would comply catastrophic a
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
complies with State Standards but it
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
would exceed federal minimum standards
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore they could get rid of it
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
under this law as
 
01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
drafted just to clarify in statute right
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
now special education a which is what
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
cat Aid is is identified clearly in
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
statute the formula is in statute so
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
what the department of education does or
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
not does not want is not going to exceed
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
what we have in statute right now
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to say well
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're turning off cat a that is by
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
Statute and Mary you're on that
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee as well Mr chairman I think
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's great to hear you say that and
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
that gives us reassurance but it's on
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Doe's list of things that it wants
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
to get rid
 
01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.589 align:start position:0%
to get rid
of

01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
okay we're the legislature and um I
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate where you're presenting to us
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
David but I I think you're safe on that
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
one okay thank you Mr are there further
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
questions just represent
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
leus can you um show me where in this
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
excess chart it says that they want to
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
get rid of these things I it doesn't say
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
that okay think it's it's a list of
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
standards that in their opinion are in
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
excess and under the way this statute is
 
01:48:59.709 --> 01:48:59.719 align:start position:0%
proposed being written these could be
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
written out of the state of New
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's special ed regs if you pass
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
this law as it's written everything on
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
this list could be written out of the RS
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm not saying that they've said we
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
want to do it but if you compile a list
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
like this there's got to be a reason why
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
you did that other than for information
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
for us could just be information right
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
so but it's it's a concern to me and
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
other other people as well representa
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
Heath do you want to say something no
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
you're good with that okay
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
further you biting your tongue thank you
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman uh i'
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
Ryan good morning good morning my name
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
is Mora Ryan and I'm a parent and an
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education student
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to indicate here that New
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doe doesn't do anything with
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
the data they have they're not proactive
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for Trends and
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
they're not searching for things that
 
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
are not going well which is in part what
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
the audit had said um almost 20% of any
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
class of students are on IEPs less than
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
3% of those are so disabled that they
 
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
would not be able to function in society
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
um however less than 4% of those
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
children will have any postsecondary
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity in either College your
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
career um I don't want my kid independ I
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't want my kid dependent on the state
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
I want him to have a career my kid is on
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
an I um and at some point I want to
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
retire and I don't want to pay for a 20%
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
class of people who can't work or can't
 
01:50:37.599 --> 01:50:39.229 align:start position:0%
class of people who can't work or can't
function

01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
um I went through every form of
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution and even
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
when I won and was awarded Services
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
those Services were never happening you
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
can nitpick all these procedural
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
elements but if you're not getting
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
results it doesn't matter there was was
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
a famous story in the Army where there
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
were P planes built that weren't
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work for the pilots because
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
they only Built the planes to
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate 5'9 inch Pilots well Pilots
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
are all shapes and sizes and the problem
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that if we don't look at the outcomes
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
which are the most important thing and
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
we worry about whether or not so many
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
days is better then we're not focusing
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
on what's happening right now students
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
on disability students with iups don't
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
have rights because in some cases the
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
state restricts what they should have
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
and to give you an example of that the
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
age 22 bill which was passed this last
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
year the federal government said that
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
kids were supposed to be in school
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
through age 22 inclusive but that was
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
not happening in our state those kids
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
were getting kicked out on their 21st
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
birthday so they don't have rights they
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't even have this the floor of Ida
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
because that's not being followed so
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
unless we start looking at the outcomes
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
and start trying to fix the issues which
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of the audit we're not
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
going to get anywhere I mean we didn't
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
look at the leas which is where most of
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
these problems are
 
01:51:54.239 --> 01:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
these problems are
happening

01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
um another example would be that there's
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
a state regulation that says that um an
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
outof District placement school has to
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
be a state approved school well if I
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
have a kid who has dyslexia who needs
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
Orton Gillingham and needs to go to
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
Linda moodbell or an academy like that
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a state approved school and
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's not in the federal rules and that
 
01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
kid is not getting the services that
 
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
kid is not getting the services that
they

01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
need the fact that New Hampshire doe
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
when they were asked to come before this
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
committee for the audit said that they
 
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do enforcement which in
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
incidentally they're getting paid $58
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
million a year from the federal doe to
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
do uh because it would be a liability to
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
them should be a great concern and there
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
should be a lot more legislation to
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
protect these kids because they're not
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
getting the bare minimum right now and
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
their outcomes are poor this 4% of
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
postsecondary that's the federal ours is
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
probably lower and I have to say us news
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
and World Report just came out with
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
their report on school districts
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
and londondary was 18 out of 100 for
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness which is a
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
high socioeconomic district and should
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
be at the top of the list thank you

life not mine however this was too
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
important to not talk in specifics he
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
did ask that I just not mention his name
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
or any pictures there were going to be
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
pictures okay so with the current
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment um if it was enacted when my
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
son entered school at 3 transitioning
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
from early supports and services to the
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
school district that possibly could have
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
been the last time that me and my late
 
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
husband would have signed sign off on
 
01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.709 align:start position:0%
husband would have signed sign off on
his

01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
IEP think about that my son is now 17
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
years old and we have had a rocky road
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
at different points but because I and my
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
late husband were an integral part of
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
his IEP team he is now posed to graduate
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
on time with a high school diploma and
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
he is posed to go to college we have
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
been on college tours that is something
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
that when my son was 3 years old and
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak we stay mon we couldn't
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
have even
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
imagined and I do want to say that
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
because we were part of the process at
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
every single step we work together as a
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
team we still work together as a team my
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
son um had a very very Rocky start to
 
01:56:19.229 --> 01:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
his educational career if you will there
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
were there were days that I was getting
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
called every single day by the school
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
there were times where he was being
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
restrained in school multiple times a
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
month and we worked through it we worked
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
together and at in the third grade there
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
was a very strong possibility that we
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
were looking at an out of District
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
placement now imagine Lincoln Woodstock
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
my little school district in the north
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
having to pay an outof District
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
placement for all of the these years and
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
more importantly what would it have done
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
to my son so just very very quickly I do
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
want to just throw one out a couple of
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
things out there that that
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%

you hearing me um so my name is Lauren
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
DWI I live in pemrick New Hampshire with
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
my husband and daughter I am here today
 
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
to oppose the non-main amendment to
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
sb340 my daughter has benefited from a
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
robust IEP individualized education plan
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm learning not to speak in acronyms
 
02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
hard um and put in place by her team as
 
02:00:25.149 --> 02:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
the parent I am a valued member of this
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
team and able to not only provide the
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
helpful information only a parent can
 
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
but also have the ability to fully
 
02:00:35.709 --> 02:00:35.719 align:start position:0%
consent or partially consent to what is
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
in the plan I am always able to come to
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
IEP meetings prepared because I am
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
provided with copies of all recent evals
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
and assessments 5 days before the
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
meeting which gives me time to go
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
through this wealth of information
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot it's
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
intimidating um I know how she was doing
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
because I know how the IEP is
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
implemented and the skill set she is
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
mastering as a parent an advocate this
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability is
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
Paramount there is nothing on this Earth
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
more important to me than my daughter
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
and ensuring a positive future for her
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
adopting this amendment makes my job
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
harder and puts my child at risk
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
as it strips away protections from the
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
use of aversives and transparent
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
communication with families like mine I
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
implore you to oppose this amendment and
 
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
send a clear message that New Hampshire
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%

away all those wonderful things you were
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
talking about there is a risk if I'm
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
reading everything correctly and what
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
people in the back have also been
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
testifying too is if I
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't if I don't have access to the team
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%

under Roman numeral 8 that part most
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%

short notice um it's fine I was just
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what part of this
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
would cause you problems thank
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%

special education services in Dober

Public Schools today I speak only for
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
myself but more importantly today I'm
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
here to represent the best interests of
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
my 14-year-old son an eighth grader at
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
Dober Middle School who has been
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services for
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
the past six years to support his
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
diagnoses of autism anxiety OCD and
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
ADHD I'm here in opposition to the
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment put forward a week ago SP 340
 
02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
began as an exceedingly straightforward
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
proposal allowing special education
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
documents to be shared with families via
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
email indeed the Bill's language was a
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
single sentence with 37 words in total I
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
counted in its proposed amended format
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
section five strips away currently held
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
protections for special education
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
students Educators and families by
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
limiting special education rules to
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
nothing more than the minimum Allowed by
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
state or feder eneral law as a parent I
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
reject the suggestion that a bare
 
02:04:59.069 --> 02:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
minimum is sufficient for my son and the
 
02:05:01.549 --> 02:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
other almost 31,000 special education
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire current rules
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
offer protections for students regarding
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
communication parental consent restraint
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
transition planning IEP implementation
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
reporting and many other rights many of
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
these important protections will
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
evaporate under the anemic standards of
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
state and federal minimums many me
 
02:05:23.069 --> 02:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
members of this committee have spoken
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
publicly in support of parental rights
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
and parental notifications I urge you to
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
consider how section five of this
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment would take away the
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
rights of parents and Guardians to make
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
timely informed decisions for their
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
children who require special education
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
services my son's annual IEP meeting
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
happened a few weeks ago and my husband
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
and I received the proposed IEP document
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
a week in advance which was a good thing
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
because it is 24 pages single spaced
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
without the communication timeline
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
protections offered in current law I
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
might not have received that document in
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
advance of our meeting which would have
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
made it impossible for me to arrive
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
prepared to discuss the proposal with
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
his treatment team recent history has
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
shown us just how hard the disability
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
Community has had to work to carve out
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
educational rights for themselves in the
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
first place I urge the committee to vote
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment and return to the
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
language as originally written this
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is a move in the wrong
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
direction ction New Hampshire special
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
educations deserve far more than the
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
bare minimum thank you thank you very
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
much are there questions yes represent
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for coming
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
for and thank you for your testimony um
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
I I understand that if this that one
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
section were included here you feel like
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
it would destroy a lot of good things
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that are working for you um this report
 
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
talks about things that are not working
 
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people in due process does
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of the amendment which
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
addresses those problems um is that past
 
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
your muster that's a great question I
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
had thought about that I I with 3
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
minutes I didn't have time to address
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
everything um but thank you for the
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
question I don't have a strong opinion
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
one way or the other I have read this
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment several times I think
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
there are some merits to many of the
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
things that representative cordelli had
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier but before I had to
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
step out for my meeting um I apologize I
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
missed probably a lot of the robust
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
discussion that has already happened um
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
I the one thing that gave me pause was
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
wondering whether it would be um an
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
undue burden on the office of the
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
special education Advocate to have to
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
enter into specific memorandums of
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
understanding for each investigative
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
case um I because I sit on the school
 
02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
board in my city we we enter into
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding and my
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
experience is that they can be a little
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
burdensome and cumbersome and um I I
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the good work
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that um that office and that role
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
is doing is not unduly burdened by um
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
paperwork and um and things that would
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
create more of a hassle in understanding
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
the situation getting the material that
 
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
is needed to be able to do that
 
02:08:01.069 --> 02:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
investigative work so all that to say I
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a strong opinion on a lot of
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
the other things um I I think there is
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
probably at least some Merit to much of
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
of what else is in there which is why my
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
testimony Focus specifically on Section
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
Five thanks thank you very much further
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you uh
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm president
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
Timothy Oran straford County's district
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
10 the towns of just the town of Durham
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm the first and probably
 
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
only uh legislator to come in and way on
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment and like uh probably
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much everyone else who spoke
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
except for cordelli I'm uh I'm uh I'm
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to it um
 
02:08:54.549 --> 02:08:54.559 align:start position:0%
and I I do do understand you know you
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
are going to be apparently excting it
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
today and perhaps you know perhaps
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
something acceptable will come out of uh
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
will come out of the executive process
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
right now I anticipate you know not
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
being able to concur with the amendment
 
02:09:10.589 --> 02:09:10.599 align:start position:0%
and my major major
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
objection is of course is Section
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
Five and
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
um as I agree with others that's totally
 
02:09:21.549 --> 02:09:21.559 align:start position:0%
unacceptable like using the existing
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
statutes as a floor they were supposed
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be a you know that was not or a
 
02:09:28.589 --> 02:09:28.599 align:start position:0%
ceiling there's supposed to be a floor
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's supposed to be a minimum so I
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
think anything that causes less special
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
education services is not good I
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
sponsored as you remember HB 1665 which
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed this house by a uh bipartisan
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%
super majority but it looks like the
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
other body on the other side of the wall
 
02:09:49.149 --> 02:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
which shall not be named is apparently
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
going to set up the interim study which
 
02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
in their case doesn't mean there's
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
likely to be any study so but um so this
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
does cut back special ed services and
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
need if you take that section out I'm
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
wondering what else you what else is
 
02:10:03.069 --> 02:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
hidden in there that's not good I mean
 
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
some of it's good but I'm wondering
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
there's probably other things that are
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
bad certainly one specific thing that
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
jumps out at me is um if this passes
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be take effect 60 days after we
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
the governor signs it so that's uh in J
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's like in August sometime or July
 
02:10:23.790 --> 02:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
and um the uh there's a report that's
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
going to be generated by September 1st
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that gives an unreasonably low amount
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
of time for the office of the special
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
Advocate who produce that report and
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's some organization
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
issue with the office of special
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
advocate in fact I think I heard that
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
there's only one person in the office
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
and I try to look up the website well
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's multitasking waiting and you know
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
they have an organization chart which
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
supposed we have about a dozen people in
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
it so there's a discrepancy there that
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
and also something that's emic to all a
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
lot of education laws is this is only
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
about the school districts um as you
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
know that's the biggest part of publicly
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
funded education but there's also uh
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
public charter schools there's also the
 
02:11:06.599 --> 02:11:07.510 align:start position:0%
public charter schools there's also the
public

02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
academies there's also the uh EFA school
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
program that's either the education
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom account or School voucher
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
depending in which side of the issue
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
you're on um either way there's the
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship organization
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
um which has to deal with special
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
education issues there's the various
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
providers that are subsidized by that
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
program they have special education
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
issues involved too so that's and that's
 
02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
more of a problem with the whole RSA
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
186c that it needs to be updated so I I
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
just uh I certainly I certainly will
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
keep a somewhat open mind depending on
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
what you decide which I guess is today
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
but I really just anticipate to this
 
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
amendment will not be acceptable to me
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
personally and um I certainly the
 
02:11:54.189 --> 02:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
simplest thing to do this lad session is
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
just passed the original Bill thanks are
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative not seeing thank you I'll
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
just add that section five it seems very
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
clear to me that it I think it means
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
what it says and I you're some people we
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.549 --> 02:12:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Carrie Duran I'm

02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
we are here today to strongly oppose the
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you um chairman lad of
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for giving me
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak today um I just
 
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate what everyone all
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
the parent Advocates especially have
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
said that the communication and being
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
part of the team is so important I'm a
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
single parent to be able to have
 
02:13:20.079 --> 02:13:22.030 align:start position:0%
single parent to be able to have
notifications

02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
notifications
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh in advance to be able to have um the
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
parent consent all of the documents this
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
year has been um quite a busy year for
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
Katie we added two new diagnosis for her
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
and she was diagnosed with Down syndrome
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
when she was born and she just was
 
02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
recently diagnosed with hearing loss and
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
we also implemented a behavioral plan
 
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
with her for her as well um that was a
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
result of her um communication issues
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
with her hearing loss if I wasn't able
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to speak
 
02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
directly with our team anytime I needed
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
to get that documentation ask for
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
further evaluations for her so she could
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
be successful I would not have a kiddo
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
that sits behind you that has
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
aspirations to go to UNH for the UNH for
 
02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:17.559 align:start position:0%

graduate this year and when we went for
 
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
those college tours she was the one
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
asking where's my program I'm going to
 
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:28.360 align:start position:0%

02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
knows that she wants to be ready to go
 
02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
to college and have those opportunities
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
and that is because of the amazing team
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
that we have in our school district and
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
it is because of the amazing um services
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we go above and beyond in the state
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to provide that my
 
02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
daughter is going to have the
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to college the
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work live on her own be
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
independent that's what we've worked so
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
hard to do and in the state of New
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have so many as you can see
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
behind me amazing parent and educator
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
Advocates I would uh implore you to
 
02:15:11.549 --> 02:15:11.559 align:start position:0%
consider taking a pause on this
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment bringing forth some of those
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and parents and really
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
hearing from them and as somebody else
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned getting into that Manu
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
with the parents at the table to share
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
with you how important every step of
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
this process is I rely on it I need that
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
partner with my school district I cannot
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
do it by myself to ensure Katie has
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
everything she needs and I'm so grateful
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
for every service that she's been
 
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
provided the care of her teachers and
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
her team and I implore you again to vote
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment thank you so much
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
much oh right on time yeah it was good
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
timing are are there any questions from
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
the yes representative pel thank you and
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and um if I
 
02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
don't catch Katie make sure I said hello
 
02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:08.599 align:start position:0%
to her
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
she representative penell and
 
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli are my
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives so we know each other
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just confused about um the
 
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
communication that will change by
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment because of course
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
we want parents to work hand
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
inand with the school district when it
 
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
comes to their children so where exactly
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
are your concerns coming from in this
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
amendment my concerns are primarily with
 
02:16:36.750 --> 02:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
the section five that have been
 
02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is my understanding that we
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
are opening the door to be able to take
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
away those protections that we do have
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
where we do go above and beyond what the
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
federal government standards are that's
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding but it's been difficult
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
because I just found out about this on
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
Sunday and you know trying to review and
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
working and the kids and you know I'm
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
just happy to be here and I brought my
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
kid along and but um yeah we needed a
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
little more time to to review also thank
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
you I have no idea what you're talking
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
about not having time I know I know
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%

Hughes thank you very
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
gocker good morning almost good
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Joanne grer I live
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
in marac with my two daughters who
 
02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
attend public school and have IEPs I
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill as amended the amendment
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
removes the protections provided to
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
parents and students with disabilities
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
as part of the special education process
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the amendment will not
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
require parents to provide informed
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
consent every time an IEP is proposed
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
the timelines in law just say reasonable
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire specif hi specific days
 
02:18:24.669 --> 02:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
reverting to this vague language puts
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
parents at a disadvantage in an already
 
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
confusing system the timelines that will
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
be removed are ones that state parents
 
02:18:35.309 --> 02:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
must be given notice before an IEP team
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
meeting 10 days in advance 5 days for a
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
manifestation determination meeting for
 
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
Behavior parents must be given 14 days
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
to respond by giving or denying consent
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
or providing partial consent to a school
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
district's proposal a school district
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
must respond to a parents request for an
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
IEP meeting in 21 days and also removes
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire as a timeline of 60
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
calendar days for initial evaluations
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
and re-evaluations can be an additional
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
30 if you remove all these timelines it
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
creates unnecessary delays and confusion
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
for families if you remove the
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
protection of parents providing informed
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
consent you're creating an imbalance of
 
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
power and sending the message that
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
parents are not an equal team member of
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
the IEP team and this moves what should
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
be an IEP team conversation
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
automatically to dispute resolution if
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
you don't allow parents to agree
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
partially agree or disagree with an IEP
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you automatically implement the IEP
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
and force parents into dispute
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
resolution it's no longer a team process
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
it becomes really contentious so I
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill with the amendment that
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
removes rights for families thank you
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
very much other questions from the
 
02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.950 align:start position:0%
very much other questions from the
committee

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
not see you thank you very much like to
 
02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
invite Kristen man
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
Manon and I always have a hard time with
 
02:19:59.479 --> 02:20:00.950 align:start position:0%
Manon and I always have a hard time with
that

02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate good morning Kristen monani
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
Office of the advocate for special
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
education it is the child's Advocate
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
that has about 12 staff ours does have
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
only one right now um I was prepared I I
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
worked closely on all of this language
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
except the language that has spent our
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
whole morning with doe um and I think
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
both of us would have been prepared kind
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
of at 9:30 to say strip out four lines
 
02:20:36.910 --> 02:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
of this section five there have been
 
02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
good questions about it representative
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
leas representative peternell about you
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
know does it really minimize rights
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't it forward-looking but we were
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
fully prepared in order to focus on the
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
language we did actually work on to say
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate that so to come to the
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
language we did work on which is the
 
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
rest of it and I'm hoping you all will
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
ask me questions about that um it was
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
designed to get at representative
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
Heath's point and and all of the parent
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
testimony we need more oversight more
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
ways to make sure that parents and
 
02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
districts are working
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
together this was supposed to be very
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
timely a quick response to the audit on
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution Which is less than 5%
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the 95% of special education it does
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
need attention because dispute
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
resolution is precisely where the
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
hand-in-hand partnership has broken down
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
between parents and
 
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
districts um to representative Luna's
 
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
Point um much earlier on with
 
02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
questioning uh the language that we did
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
work on everything except those lines of
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
section five was really intended
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
precisely um and the Department of
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
Education was very willing to take on
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
more managerial oversight and all of
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
these Provisions actually do put burden
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
on them and they give office access to
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
sort of look at turning anecdote into
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
Data um a lot of the special education
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
audit report did rely on some parental
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
anecdote you know the stories of what
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
has gone wrong for them in doing dispute
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
resolution one of the auditor main
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerns was we went to the doe and we
 
02:22:15.309 --> 02:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
said give us charts and data of
 
02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
timelines you know for how these
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
procedures have been overseen
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and it was in staff heads again
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
anecdote and not as clearly in data so
 
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
so the intent of all of the other
 
02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
language in here was to turn anecdote
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
into data and then give in the future
 
02:22:34.990 --> 02:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
potentially the legislature much more
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
concrete information my office more
 
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
concrete information even doe itself um
 
02:22:43.469 --> 02:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to say okay is more Staffing
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
needed what is the scope of the problem
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of all of these anecdotal
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
stories of struggles with dispute
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
solution many of the things you've heard
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
about are going to be the other audit
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
95% of special EDS so I would ask very
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
strongly for questions on everything but
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
that language and that instead of voting
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
against this full amendment that um all
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the legislators say let's consider
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
all of the language except those four
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
lines and take them
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
out thank you thank you very much um I
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
do have a question for you um having
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
having worked with you a bit on this
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and taking section five and putting
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that over here do you have a problem or
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
is there I recognize we have a database
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
problem at the department with
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
software that's unable to deliver an
 
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
individual report to you you end up
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing everything there is theou partial
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
resolve to this or or you know where if
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
we get anou between your department you
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
doe a where they would provide that
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
individual report to you is that going
 
02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
to give you all the information that you
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
need or are you looking for more
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
aggregate information of of of processes
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
and looking at how many were there in
 
02:24:07.469 --> 02:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
this particular year or the preceding
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
year that were due process and is that
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
where you're going to get the
 
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
information or you're going to get it at
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
the local
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
level a lot of questions in there there
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
are a lot of questions in there I'm
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to try to do them all quickly yeah
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
um theou was not my first preference in
 
02:24:25.269 --> 02:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
this as as representative cordelli said
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
this went through many drafts I am
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with theou um there were a
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns raised about privacy I
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
was asking for full access to our nessus
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
database um I believe that was initially
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
um kind of part of the intent of access
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
which is not in this amendment but
 
02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
separate um in legislation I am okay
 
02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
with the I think it will get me um and
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
my off it's a lot of the information
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
that we're seeking I've worked closely
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues At Doe um and I think
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
what we can do you know they've really
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
taken on burden in this so I I think I
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
want to say at no point was doe trying
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
to put any language in that allowed them
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
to get rid of all of the um rules in
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
excess that that was never any part of
 
02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
any discussion here so I really feel
 
02:25:14.269 --> 02:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
like they've been a bit vilified there
 
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
they were taking on burden to themselves
 
02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
they were conscious of not overburdening
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
our districts um and there was a lot of
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about burden on privacy and
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality if we went with my
 
02:25:26.269 --> 02:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
office having full access as opposed to
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
anou that got reports from the
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
Department that they would be taking on
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
the burden of preparing and so we
 
02:25:35.550 --> 02:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
settled on theou and the report piece um
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
I think it will go a long way um and I'm
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it as a first step
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
that's very responsive to the audit and
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
lets us really look at what's needed
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
here to ensure that our special
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
education dollars which are substantial
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
are really about parent and um School
 
02:25:52.479 --> 02:25:53.429 align:start position:0%
are really about parent and um School
District

02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and that we're not spending
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for services that aren't agreed
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
where things have really broken down um
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the local piece that has
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
been brought up a couple times
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I think you
 
02:26:08.190 --> 02:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the local District piece
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
where documents are
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
alleged um this this did get a lot of
 
02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
attention um from the Department staff
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
and myself and you know a it was settled
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
we were not putting a burden on local
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
districts to come up with anything new
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
we were simply saying if you have
 
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes that will
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
be less easy in all of the other
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
language of this legislation which deals
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
with reports I could get through
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
Theseus if local districts have those
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
separate resolution processes tell the
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
department what they are and to
 
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's point the
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
sentence goes on to say that local
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
districts will um report on which have
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
been used within in the district each
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
year including the topic of the dispute
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
and the resolution if any and there our
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
vision was that there would be timelines
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
there as well that was a big part of the
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
audit is give us reports that show
 
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
us you know disputes resolutions and the
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
timelines of those and we have to
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
disaggregate some happen at the local
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
level a fraction happen at the state
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
level I'd like to see a little bit more
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it's all well
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you represent beler
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:27:24.030 --> 02:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
being here for your uh for your
 
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and this question which deals
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
with not the one that's been
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
particularly controversial so far but
 
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
kind of what we were just discussing on
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
page two um lines 10 through
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
14 um shows a number of category of
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
Parental refusals on and on to uh to
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
tracking those refusals and um whatnot
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
and my concern here would be does this
 
02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
not perhaps provide a a further impetus
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
or incentive or disincentive necess how
 
02:28:00.269 --> 02:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
you look at it
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
schools um initiate dispute resolution
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
processes when parents are refusing
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
Services um absolutely I I don't think
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
it provides a disincentive I actually
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
think it provides an incentive um right
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
now very few school districts are the
 
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
ones who initiate those dispute resol
 
02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
ones who initiate those dispute resol
solution

02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
processes um they have more resources to
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
do it they have kind of attorneys that
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
they can hire to get that done quickly
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
for parents it is much harder to
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
initiate a dispute resolution process
 
02:28:35.710 --> 02:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
but as a result sometimes IEPs sit
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
forever with parental refusal we're at
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
an impass and money is being spended on
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
services to students that either are
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
from years prior IEPs not matching where
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
the student is at that point
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
or that parents disagree with saying you
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
know you're you're spending this money
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
on this service for my student I don't
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
think he or she needs that he or she
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
needs this so um it is an
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
incentive I think um districts would not
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
be penalized by this because the report
 
02:29:07.870 --> 02:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
would show they filed they got a dispute
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
resol quickly right instead of having an
 
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.469 --> 02:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
years H be careful just very very
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
briefly and thank you for speak because
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I was interested I'm
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering is there not a cause for
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
us to have concern for schools having an
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
new incentive to initiate dispute
 
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
resolution against parents who may not
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
want certain
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
services so my answer is outside the
 
02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
scope of this but um definitely going to
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
be advocating for more staff for my
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
office and one of the things that the
 
02:29:44.429 --> 02:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
department is taking on and as I said
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
they have actually taken on a lot of
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility in all of this strip
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
section five out with which they had no
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
comment on and never tried to initiate
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
um the we've all admitted there would be
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
more resources needed but one of the
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
things the department has taken on um
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and it is explicitly laid out in here is
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
that they would be running reports
 
02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
currently they have access to the data
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's no burden on the districts um
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
they are required whether or not they
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
use nessus our database to create their
 
02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
IEPs or their notices they are required
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
to report in there with a couple clicks
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
of a button whether parents have refused
 
02:30:20.399 --> 02:30:21.110 align:start position:0%
of a button whether parents have refused
an

02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:30:23.269 --> 02:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
IEP and the
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
date currently doe doesn't and in part
 
02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
it will require some staff adjustment on
 
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
their part run reports on that data they
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
have fully committed to and and and
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
really quickly saying we can run monthly
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
reports on that data my office would
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
probably be requesting those reports and
 
02:30:43.469 --> 02:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
we will take the initiative monthly to
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
send to every parent who showed up as
 
02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
refusing consent a one-page clear
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
statement we understand you just refused
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
consent here are your resources that
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
would include the listing of my office
 
02:30:56.269 --> 02:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
right now I don't have staff to even
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
begin to take care of that but that's a
 
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
separate piece that we'll address um the
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
doe does not have enough staff in terms
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
of hearing officers again we want to
 
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
turn anecdotes into Data so that the
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can see what you know it
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
might address in the future um via this
 
02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
limited legislation so I don't think
 
02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
parents would be harmed as long as we
 
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
can get them some resources um um to put
 
02:31:22.429 --> 02:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
their points out there and honestly with
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
those dispute resolution processes I've
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
seen some of them turn out um especially
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
recently in parent in Parental favor and
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be my objective if
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
I thought it warranted thank you further
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions represented Ry thank you and
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
glad that you are comfortable with the
 
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
idea of anou are you comfortable with
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of maintaining multiple M us at
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
time so um this legislation I do not
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
read as requiring me to have anou for
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
access to every single individual file
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um what it will do you know for there is
 
02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
a question or a debate but it would be
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
solved outside of anou um and I we would
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
go with whatever a school district
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
requested so as not to waste time on the
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
battle but parents who come to my office
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
and ask for my help and that of Staff
 
02:32:15.550 --> 02:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
whom I hope to have
 
02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh can easily sign consent for us to
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
have access to anything and arguable
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislation creating my office already
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
created that right even without parental
 
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
consent so none of those accessing of
 
02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
documents would require anou theou would
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
be more for me to get the monthly
 
02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
reports and the annual data that is
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this legislation from
 
02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
doe represent
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning um just a question
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
you indicated that you were part of the
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
group that developed the first four and
 
02:32:51.389 --> 02:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
talk about the first four can you tell
 
02:32:54.429 --> 02:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
me where the fifth one came from um
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
there was believe it or not there were
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
parents involved in this um who you know
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and representative cordelli was
 
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
acting on some of that parental feedback
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
at the time um and several pieces that I
 
02:33:07.950 --> 02:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
think he cited in the legislative audit
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
that said look we're layering on and I
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
have given testimony as to this too
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
we're layering on additional pieces
 
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
again we can understand how five came
 
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
about better if we understand that this
 
02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
was meant to be solely about dispute
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
resolution in response to the audit so
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of areas in the
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution piece that were cited
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
as having been kind of excess processes
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that created confusion excess
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirements um so initially this came
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
about and and obviously didn't have
 
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
enough Focus which is why I said
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to recommend we delete
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
that and go with the rest um it came
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
about in response to let's not create
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
excess that elongates processes creates
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
confusion puts parents through uh where
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
do I go someone said here someone said
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
here someone said here all of those
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
being potentially true let's get things
 
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit more streamlined and clear
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
that was the Genesis of it um and it was
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
kind of some meetings with parents and
 
02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.309 align:start position:0%
kind of some meetings with parents and
some

02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
feedback I think it needs more thank
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
have um are we also going to be hearing
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
from the Department yes we have some
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
technical advice but they're not taking
 
02:34:31.389 --> 02:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
positions on things but technical
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
question we have several agencies that
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
want to provide technical support but I
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
have one more question for you um when
 
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're requesting from the Department
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
from that
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
database seems to be the real one of the
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
big issues we're dealing with here and
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a singular record I
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but when you're then at
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
looking for multiple records during the
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
course of the year maybe to give you a
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
profile on what is going on in terms of
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the number of going due process rout
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
for those that may not um we get into
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
possible litigation and liability issues
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
with the department and that it to me is
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
a real concern here where we're going to
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
be Loy Lo loing up people I'm getting
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
tired here but it's going to be a costly
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
issue did we address that or has that
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
been addressed by yourself or at least
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
through theou I think it's fully
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
addressed in the sense um as as you said
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad you did some work
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
with us on this there was language in
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill that was much broader in terms
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
of my office's access to the database
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
itself um which has been stripped from
 
02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
it so the mou I really think is looking
 
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
for um more aggregate data the one place
 
02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
that someone pointed out it does mention
 
02:35:49.269 --> 02:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information is
 
02:35:52.429 --> 02:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
in there um with respect
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to um disputes that go to
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the state level and either get to due
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
process or get to um State complaint
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
pieces and the personally identifiable
 
02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
information um was in there in order to
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
be able to say okay we have this report
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
where a 100 parents in the past 30 days
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
have refused their
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
IEPs I need a little bit of information
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
just to know which ones of those went by
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
student ID or something which of those
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
went where for resolution that was The
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
Limited kind of scenario of that piece
 
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
but I think the broader issues you're
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
referring to that there were concerns
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
from doj about um liability and about
 
02:36:36.269 --> 02:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I think that's been
 
02:36:38.349 --> 02:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
stripped from this there is no nothing
 
02:36:40.269 --> 02:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
that gives my office um that the
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
provisions they were most concerned
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
about were deleted in their entirety
 
02:36:45.469 --> 02:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
okay I was thinking dog thank you um
 
02:36:47.269 --> 02:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
further questions representa
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
leus thank you um
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I understand
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
what you said about uh section five
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 8 that that was not
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
intended to be all of the rules
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
regarding special ed but only that
 
02:37:07.359 --> 02:37:08.710 align:start position:0%
regarding special ed but only that
regarding

02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
to uh dispute resolution is that did I
 
02:37:14.910 --> 02:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly um to clarify
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
that someone asked me how uh
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I believe asked
 
02:37:21.269 --> 02:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
me how that got in there um um it got in
 
02:37:23.710 --> 02:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
there in a discussion about rules
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
relating to dis dispute resolution um
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
the way it is written and that is why I
 
02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
would support it it's
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
broader thank Youk thank you very much
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%

Michelle Wen um from the New Hampshire
 
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
legal assistance I'm the youth Law
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
Project Director there who works with
 
02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
children involved in special education
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
issues school to prison pipeline issues
 
02:38:09.269 --> 02:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
and then also Foster youth um I'm here
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of sections 2
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
three and four which is what you just
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
heard of um in terms of data sharing
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
data is always good more data um is
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
always a good thing and I think we can
 
02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
do lots of good things with that data as
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by the recent audit audit
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
however I'm taking no position on one in
 
02:38:30.190 --> 02:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
six and I testifying in strong
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to section five as you've
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
heard from many people before me this
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
seems to be a very dangerous POS um
 
02:38:40.269 --> 02:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
provision in terms of parental rights
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I don't think has
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
been discussed that I just wanted to
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to is that RSA 541
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
a17 says no rule and this is talking
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
about about the doe rules inclusive um
 
02:38:53.950 --> 02:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
shall be effective for a period of
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
longer than 10 years except as extended
 
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to other portions of 541a so
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
what that provision says is that all
 
02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
rules including these doe rules have
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
will expire after 10 years and must be
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
reauthorized the way section five is
 
02:39:13.710 --> 02:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
written the rules as they exist now
 
02:39:16.349 --> 02:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
cannot be reauthorized to the extent
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
they exceed federal law um If This Were
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
to pass so with the with representative
 
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
leus your question is is this looking
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
retroactively or to the
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
Future it could potentially be to the
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
Future until we hit the reauthorization
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
time at which point all of the
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
protections that you've heard that these
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
families have benefited from would not
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
be able to be reauthorized so I think
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's a really important point and why
 
02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
this um why this provision is dangerous
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
for these families who have benefited
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
from these protections for so long um I
 
02:39:54.990 --> 02:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
have worked I work primarily with
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
lowincome folks um who are whose
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
children are struggling in the education
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
world and they struggle tremendously
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
just to get in the door of special
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
education um the the rules surrounding
 
02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
their access to information the
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
timelines by which they must hear back
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
from the schools those are really
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
important for them and when I get
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
involved in cases they often have gone
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
years years without even getting a call
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
back from districts and so what I ask
 
02:40:27.309 --> 02:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
you to do is I think the the the doe
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
audit is problematic it is incredibly
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
problematic but removing protections
 
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
that parents benefit from I don't think
 
02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
is the way to address this I think the
 
02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
way to address this um is to bolster the
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
doe oversight of local school districts
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
and ensure that they have the resources
 
02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
to provide the oversight of local school
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
districts that they need um the office
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the special education Advocate is
 
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
helping it's helping bring to light some
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the problems in the local school
 
02:40:59.309 --> 02:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
districts but again when you know when
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
I've represented parents and they file
 
02:41:03.309 --> 02:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
complaints against districts I mean
 
02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
we've I've been in litigation over yes
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
the school district has violated the
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
special education rules however we're
 
02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
not going to provide you any relief I
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually brought that complaint to the
 
02:41:16.510 --> 02:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court and we ended
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
up mediating and you know it is what it
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
is but
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
but that the problem is the oversight
 
02:41:26.269 --> 02:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
not not the rules that we Empower
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
parents to be able to access their
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
rights and so I just I again I just want
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
to testify in strong opposition to
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
section five um and and and also just
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
the um I guess the sense that we may be
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
better off um having these rules and
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
statute as opposed to in rules my
 
02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
concern there having been part of the
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
rul making process I'm just going to
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
finish this one thought um is that the
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
rul making process is done by Educators
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
doe stakeholders who are very intimately
 
02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
involved in this work my worry taking it
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of that process and
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
into the legislature is is it becomes
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
very um subject to the whim of politics
 
02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
at any time and education should be
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
stable for parents and the doe and
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
school districts so that they know what
 
02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
to expect year after year and they know
 
02:42:17.710 --> 02:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
that this 10-year reauthorization
 
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
process is coming up and they need to be
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
engaged and involved in that process to
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that children and school
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
districts and the budget are all
 
02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
protected in a way that we want it to be
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you I'm sorry
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um my question since
 
02:42:38.349 --> 02:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
we have established that all of the
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
rules that are
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
currently here are actually authorized
 
02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:45.590 align:start position:0%
currently here are actually authorized
by

02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
Statute is there any reason that when we
 
02:42:50.349 --> 02:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
look at them again that they would go
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
away if we have already authorized them
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
by Statute statute doesn't go away so
 
02:42:59.550 --> 02:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
why would the rules go or how would the
 
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
rules go away yep so so in section five
 
02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
it says in no case shall the State Board
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
adopt a rule that exceeds state or
 
02:43:13.710 --> 02:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
federal minimum requirements unless
 
02:43:15.389 --> 02:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
unless the rule is specifically
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute so Ru making is
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
authorized by by Statute so either and
 
02:43:23.309 --> 02:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
one of two things could happen here
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
either section Section 5 is meaningless
 
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
because all rules are authorized by
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
Statute or it would be interpreted to
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
mean that the rules authorized by the
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and subject to
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
Jael car um could not exceed Federal
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
requirements so to the extent there's
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
that list of document or the list of
 
02:43:45.389 --> 02:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
rules that exceed federal law those
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
rules could not be reauthorized if we
 
02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
don't interpret it like that
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
this section has no impact and it's
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
superflous and why would we pass a
 
02:43:58.349 --> 02:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
superus law thank you thank you very
 
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
you oh was there oh yes representa
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
Howard oh so
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
apologies didn't see your hand yeah
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you Mr chairman
 
02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
do you know when a majority of rules
 
02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
will need to be Rewritten by so I
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
believe the last reauthorization was
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
2017 that's when I was involved in it
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
and that's I think what the rule book
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
says so I think it's
 
02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
2027 okay um although I've heard 2025
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
here today I don't know where that's
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
coming from um so I would have said 2027
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
somebody may have more information than
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
I do I think that's a question for the
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
department so about one to three years
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
one to three years okay thank you and we
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
can find exactly because we have the
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
department here and they can Us in that
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
you you have a question da and just a
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so so would that
 
02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:50.790 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so so would that
affect

02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
affect
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
um kids that have students that have
 
02:44:56.190 --> 02:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
IEPs right now
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
potentially I think I
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
think would it tomorrow I mean I think
 
02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
it depends on how how no no no I'm
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
talking about effect the students by the
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
time they get to you know when they're
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
in school in 2027 yes so we're talking
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
about you know K through nine if this is
 
02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
not a superflous law and it means what
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
it says it means that the department
 
02:45:19.950 --> 02:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
cannot um pass
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
rules that exceed federal or state law
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
um and there's not a state law
 
02:45:25.439 --> 02:45:27.110 align:start position:0%
um and there's not a state law
specifically

02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
authorizing that protection I think it
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
it absolutely will have an impact and I
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
can give you an example so um rules so
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
so the doe is authorized to implement
 
02:45:43.710 --> 02:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
rules pertaining to school discipline
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
and statute there there's always we we
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
readed the statute several years ago
 
02:45:52.670 --> 02:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
but when the department implemented
 
02:45:55.469 --> 02:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
rules pertaining to school discipline um
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in 2011 and enry
 
02:46:02.429 --> 02:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
Keegan B had the opportunity to assess
 
02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not um the rules pertaining
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
to school discipline which provides some
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
provided schools some guideposts of when
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
to implement what type of discipline um
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said that those rules
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
exceeded SE federal or exceeded State
 
02:46:18.910 --> 02:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Statute because the state statute was so
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
abroad and it it essentially said that a
 
02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
school could impose any type of
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
discipline for any purpose the doe tried
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
to put some guideposts around that the
 
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court invalidated those rules
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
completely um because those guideposts
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
were not um were not auth were not
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
authorized by the specific statute and
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
so again with that lens taking away
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
these protections and explicitly saying
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the rules cannot exceed federal law
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
or state statute when we have a statute
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
that that does authorize this rulle
 
02:46:58.590 --> 02:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
making is very dangerous and needs a lot
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
more thought if we don't want to harm
 
02:47:01.630 --> 02:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
Children and
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
Families further
 
02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.150 --> 02:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you chairman lad
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
and House Education committee my name is
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Belmont Earl I live in
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
barington with my husband and our two
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
schoolage children Sammy dude and ziki
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
Zoo um I'm opposed to the non- derain
 
02:47:43.870 --> 02:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
sb340 my children have individualized
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
educational programs and both are
 
02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
protected by the New Hampshire standards
 
02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
for the education for children with
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities if this non- derain
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted these rules will be
 
02:48:03.070 --> 02:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
at risk as we just heard um and my boys
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
could be at risk according to the
 
02:48:08.190 --> 02:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
amendment administrative rules regarding
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
special education shall not exce exceed
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
state or federal minimum requirements
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
unless specific specifically authorized
 
02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:15.870 align:start position:0%
unless specific specifically authorized
by

02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
Statute Um this can mean that the New
 
02:48:20.910 --> 02:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standards for the education
 
02:48:23.469 --> 02:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities which do
 
02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
exceed federal and state minimum
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
requirements could be done away with
 
02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
possibly as early as next year we hear
 
02:48:34.349 --> 02:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
that this leaves all children with an
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
IEP in a vulnerable and uncertain
 
02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
position their families would not have
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
clear rules to follow when advocating
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
for their children's education and
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
safety the New Hampshire standards
 
02:48:47.550 --> 02:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
protects our children from aversive
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
therapies and from from being placed in
 
02:48:52.269 --> 02:48:52.279 align:start position:0%
an out ofate facility that uses
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
aversives aversives are a discredited
 
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
form of therapy that values compliance
 
02:49:00.030 --> 02:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
above the well-being of the child
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
removing the standards possibly um
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
because they are not the minimum state
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
requirements can open the door to such
 
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
practices as shocking children with an
 
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
electric prod which is still used in the
 
02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
judge rotenberg Center in
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now because of the rules
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
our children cannot be played placed in
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
the judge rotenberg Center um but remove
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
them and it becomes an
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
option my family history taught me that
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
I can never take my children's safety
 
02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
for granted my grandfather was one of
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
the people that were snuck into the
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
lonia state school in the 1950s to film
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
the abuses happening to disabled
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
children there in the hope that the New
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government would do something
 
02:49:46.349 --> 02:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
about it it took
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
decades if you attach this gerain
 
02:49:53.070 --> 02:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to SP 340 you could be opening
 
02:49:55.469 --> 02:49:55.479 align:start position:0%
a door to abuses that could take decades
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
to end I sorry that I have to say these
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
things I am sorry I need to protect my
 
02:50:06.269 --> 02:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
children from them but apparently I do
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
the risk this amendment poses to my
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
children who are in preschool in first
 
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
grade so if in three years this passes
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
they will still be in elementary school
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's real
 
02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
and other children like
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
them your job is to make sure you learn
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
from our history and continue to protect
 
02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
the work of generations of people
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
Generations that have made New Hampshire
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
a place that values all our
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
children and think we deserve more than
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
just minimum requirements and thank you
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%

committee not seeing any thank you

still morning my name is Deborah house
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh I am the President of the American
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire and
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
I am here to speak in opposition of this
 
02:51:21.070 --> 02:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
non- gerain amendment now we had no
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
problem with the original s SP 340 which
 
02:51:25.389 --> 02:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
was a way to make communication a little
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
bit easier between parents and uh school
 
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
districts and schools um when uh
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
delivering notices about routine um
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
communication for students with
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities this however goes far
 
02:51:40.429 --> 02:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
beyond that which is why it's an 100
 
02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
Main Amendment but it comes up at the
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
last moment and certainly we did not
 
02:51:46.349 --> 02:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
have time to do a lot of study on it but
 
02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
our main concern is what you purpose
 
02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
many others here it's about that section
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
five where uh we're talking about rule
 
02:51:57.070 --> 02:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
um rule making that exceed state or
 
02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
federal minimum requirements unless the
 
02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
rule is specifically authorized by
 
02:52:04.710 --> 02:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
Statute um every Grand State child has
 
02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
the constitutional right to a robust
 
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
public education that's every single
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
granted State Child even those that have
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
special learning needs that need support
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
with special education services you've
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
heard from many um pass parents here
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
speaking up for their children all of
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
those students have the right to access
 
02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
a free and appropriate public education
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
and those are supported by our special
 
02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
education rules now we host that in
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
rules instead of writing a single
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
statute for every single procedure we
 
02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
use but our students and our parents are
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
relying on those rules that are in place
 
02:52:45.190 --> 02:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
now so that they know how to access
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
their free and appropriate public
 
02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
education so if you make a change like
 
02:52:51.790 --> 02:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
this in an amendment that was introduced
 
02:52:53.630 --> 02:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
basically at the 11th Hour in the
 
02:52:56.590 --> 02:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
session with very little notice you will
 
02:52:59.710 --> 02:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
be you could be changing it right now or
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
maybe opening it up for change next year
 
02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
but with very little uh ability for
 
02:53:08.469 --> 02:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
parents who are relying on those rules
 
02:53:10.110 --> 02:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
and students who are relying on those
 
02:53:13.389 --> 02:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
rules to get their public education to
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
know what's going to change you've heard
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
some of the things are going to change
 
02:53:19.150 --> 02:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
are um the timelines the amount of
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
notice parents get before could change
 
02:53:23.349 --> 02:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of notice parents get before
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
a meeting the right to have the um
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
evaluation reports so you can read them
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
and understand them before you go into a
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the prohibition on use of
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
aversives such as uh withholding food to
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
try and get a student be to behave overh
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
holding water or using electric shock or
 
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
noxious smells those are all practices I
 
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
think we could um agree we are poor and
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used on any child and
 
02:53:48.190 --> 02:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
should not be part of special education
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
why we want to weaken rules because they
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't um exist written down currently in
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
our statutes this should not be done
 
02:54:00.030 --> 02:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment is in expedient to
 
02:54:01.309 --> 02:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislate I can't speak to the other
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
parts of the amendment because I don't
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
got time to read them through you got to
 
02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
give us time this is not the way we
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
should be making laws um I understand
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
that the writers of the amendment worked
 
02:54:13.469 --> 02:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
with some parents but there are many
 
02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
parents there are 30,000 students in our
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
Public Schools who are getting special
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
education services and they all come
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
with parents and families who are
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
supporting them they all should be heard
 
02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
before anything like this is passed and
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going to wrap it up now
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
because my time is up but we oppose this
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
amendment and it really should not be
 
02:54:32.429 --> 02:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
pushed through thanks Deborah are there
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee not see you thank you okay I
 
02:54:50.349 --> 02:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lad members of the
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee almost good afternoon thank
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
you for uh sitting through so much
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony today I will try not to repeat
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
things that have already been said uh
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
for anyone who does not know I'm Becky
 
02:55:03.070 --> 02:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
Wilson I'm the director of governmental
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire school
 
02:55:06.990 --> 02:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
boards Association uh we are opposed to
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment I will steer clear of the
 
02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
section five I think that that's been
 
02:55:13.469 --> 02:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
probably talked about enough today um
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
however we feel this amendment in
 
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
general is not needed in our opinion at
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
a minimum we would Advocate the changes
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
especially some that are so substantial
 
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
as what is contained in this amendment
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
should be considered as a whole once the
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
full special ed audit is completed um
 
02:55:30.309 --> 02:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
there are Domino effects that come with
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
changes to special ed rules and or any
 
02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
rules to for that matter and knowing
 
02:55:37.469 --> 02:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
that there is an active audit going on
 
02:55:39.070 --> 02:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
right now and seeing that just this one
 
02:55:42.269 --> 02:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
section produced 188 Pages worth of
 
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
information I think it is um too quick
 
02:55:47.150 --> 02:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to put into place something
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
that should be the end of a pro process
 
02:55:50.429 --> 02:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
and changes to the end of a process
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
before any of the other information has
 
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
come out about the other aspects of the
 
02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
audit um in addition we would say that
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of information mentioned in
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment is already available
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
publicly for data in terms of looking at
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
indicator data at the district level
 
02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
every district is audited on 17 special
 
02:56:10.590 --> 02:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
Le data points every single year there's
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
a state performance plan you can look at
 
02:56:14.429 --> 02:56:14.439 align:start position:0%
every single District in terms of these
 
02:56:17.229 --> 02:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
17 indicator data um and those include
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
things like parent involvement um
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
disproportionate representation child
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
find find transition hearing requests
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
and how they were resolved mediation
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
agreements um results of due process
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearings are also available online with
 
02:56:33.070 --> 02:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
information that is redacted so I'm not
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
sure what information is missing um that
 
02:56:37.229 --> 02:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
would be needed I think that was our
 
02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
other concern in terms of this amendment
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't talk at all about what it
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
says personally identifying information
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to so what
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
what is included um I think anybody who
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
has seen a student's IEP I think
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned previously their
 
02:56:55.389 --> 02:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
child's IEP was something like 20 Pages
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon to have students who
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
have a 30 or 40 page IEP quite honestly
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
with really extensive information um
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
outlining family situations medical
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um history of evaluation data
 
02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
that can go back many years um even in a
 
02:57:13.469 --> 02:57:13.479 align:start position:0%
current IEP you may have at least the
 
02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
previous three years information in
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
there if not more than that um
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
situational information about families
 
02:57:21.229 --> 02:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
and how that's impacting the child's
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
ability to be successful at school or
 
02:57:25.229 --> 02:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
not um there's a lot of personal
 
02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
information so I'm not sure what else um
 
02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
would be available to the office of the
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
special ed Advocate uh if a parent goes
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
to the office now they can give parental
 
02:57:36.349 --> 02:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
consent for The Advocate to look at
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
their child's IEP so that's already in
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
place um so have I'm not sure what would
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
be in theou as well I think we heard a
 
02:57:44.229 --> 02:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about maybe what the
 
02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
intention was of theou but uh for
 
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
leaning on any of the experience of
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
developing M us the last couple of years
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
around Special Ed I think we've seen how
 
02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
difficult that process can be and how
 
02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
confusing theou can be we still are
 
02:57:59.349 --> 02:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
having challenges with Charter School M
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
us and special EDS so I think theou idea
 
02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
is concerning uh lastly this amendment
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention at all the specialed
 
02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
policy and procedures manual that has to
 
02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
be housed at every single District that
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
outlines the district levels processes
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
for special ed all of the policies that
 
02:58:16.750 --> 02:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
are in place in that District it is
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
specific to the district so if you're
 
02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what local districts are
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
providing for alternative options those
 
02:58:24.190 --> 02:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
should already be outlined in there the
 
02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
majority of those are available uh
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
online publicly so um I I think we would
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
support the idea of putting together
 
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
some sort of committee to look at all of
 
02:58:36.190 --> 02:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
the results of the special ed audit and
 
02:58:38.190 --> 02:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
look at how to sort of back into some of
 
02:58:40.349 --> 02:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
these decisions that are being made um
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
and to take into account things like
 
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
District actions where the district is
 
02:58:46.790 --> 02:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
required to file for due process as part
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the special ed rules and when the
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
district is not able at any level to to
 
02:58:53.150 --> 02:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
file for due process there are specific
 
02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
decisions where the district has to take
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
action either way um there are also
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
situations where there can be a
 
02:59:03.229 --> 02:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
disagreement um that doesn't require a
 
02:59:05.070 --> 02:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
resolution that is in the rules there
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
are some things where you just agree to
 
02:59:08.510 --> 02:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
disagree that is outlined in the special
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
ed rules I'm concerned about the
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
language um in the amendment talking
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
about resolution and whether or not
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
things have been resolved is it really
 
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
looking at resolution or is it looking
 
02:59:21.429 --> 02:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
at satisfaction with the resolution
 
02:59:24.229 --> 02:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
result because there are very few times
 
02:59:26.429 --> 02:59:26.439 align:start position:0%
but there are times where a resolution
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
might not be satisfactory to a parent or
 
02:59:31.030 --> 02:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
to a district that's understandable I
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
think we heard a lot of those situations
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about developing this
 
02:59:37.710 --> 02:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
office in the first place um but you
 
02:59:39.070 --> 02:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
know that that there's a big difference
 
02:59:40.750 --> 02:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
between something being resolved and
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
somebody being satisfied with the
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
results of that resolution thank thank
 
02:59:45.790 --> 02:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
you very much further questions from the
 
02:59:48.190 --> 02:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa Dr thank thank
 
02:59:50.229 --> 02:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question um
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at page uh two at the bottom
 
02:59:54.910 --> 02:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
where it says to assist in the
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
Fulfillment of the duty to prepare this
 
02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
annual report um they were asking for
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
the reports generated on the databases
 
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I feel like that's a a direct answer
 
03:00:07.710 --> 03:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
to a specific need in here so why would
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
you not support that uh thank you for
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
the question representative dry first of
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
all I'm not sure what other databases
 
03:00:16.269 --> 03:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
any databases other than nessus would be
 
03:00:20.110 --> 03:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
applicable um the process um procedures
 
03:00:22.229 --> 03:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
complaints Etc is outside of the office
 
03:00:24.030 --> 03:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
of special ed at the department it has
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
nothing it's actually run in a totally
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
different uh department at the
 
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so I'm not sure
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
what reports or databases they're
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining but the outcomes of due
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
process hearings are posted online at
 
03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:37.790 align:start position:0%
process hearings are posted online at
the

03:00:37.790 --> 03:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
department thank you further questions
 
03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
03:00:44.429 --> 03:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:00:44.439 --> 03:00:45.710 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
being

03:00:45.710 --> 03:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
here could you comment in light of what
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
you said about um a lot of this
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
information already being available if
 
03:00:58.670 --> 03:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
you look at page one of the bill lines
 
03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
25 and then going from there to page two
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
line six so those I think four bullet
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
points are all of those items already
 
03:01:11.229 --> 03:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
available it some of that seems familiar
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
to me already thank you for the question
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Damon um in response to
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
the date the date in line 26
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
every district has to submit a child
 
03:01:22.429 --> 03:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
count on October 1st and that would
 
03:01:24.190 --> 03:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
outline exactly how many students are
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
identified and in what categories so
 
03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
this date could be adjusted I think to
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
be more representative of an actual
 
03:01:33.309 --> 03:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
snapshot of the current year if it were
 
03:01:36.150 --> 03:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
October 15 even November 1st because
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
you're going this September 1st data
 
03:01:40.710 --> 03:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
would be pulled from the previous year's
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
identification so that doesn't make a
 
03:01:44.229 --> 03:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to me but yes that is
 
03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
available already um the PE the number
 
03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
of kids in each category and grade level
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's already
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
available um expenditures are available
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
um I know there's other legislation
 
03:01:59.710 --> 03:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
already as well about announcing or
 
03:02:01.469 --> 03:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
posting your expenditures and what you
 
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
received from the Department in terms of
 
03:02:06.229 --> 03:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
idea funds um and annual progress on the
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
state performance plan as I said is all
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
available by District online for 17
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
different special ed indicators thank
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah we have those idea indicators
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
especially Part B number five where we
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
it gives you the three categories of
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
weighted IEP we received that in
 
03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
accordance what Becky just said we do
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
have the department here that if we have
 
03:02:30.510 --> 03:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
specific questions now we can ask we've
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
gone through all the public cards that I
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
have but we have the department uh
 
03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
technical assistance is there to provide
 
03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
we have Liz Brown and Rebecca fette Liz
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%

okay could uh a Becky not a Becky you're
 
03:02:55.870 --> 03:02:55.880 align:start position:0%

about five I'm going to leave that to
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
Liz she's going to talk to you about
 
03:03:53.150 --> 03:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
five um most of the language that's in
 
03:03:55.469 --> 03:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
here including um the first paragraph
 
03:03:58.349 --> 03:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
Was language that was in the statute
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
already so for the first change that
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're asking for this was something that
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
said the district had to in writing
 
03:04:08.429 --> 03:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
notify the department of refusals and
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
what we did was we said we already have
 
03:04:11.469 --> 03:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
this information in nessus we're already
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
able to pull this information that's an
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
extra step for them to have to in
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
writing notify the department so we
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
changed that so so that we would pull
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
the report from nessus so we would know
 
03:04:22.750 --> 03:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
how many rejected IEPs or partially
 
03:04:25.229 --> 03:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
rejected IEPs um and then would pass it
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
on so that we could P we could send
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
information about the different dispute
 
03:04:32.030 --> 03:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
resolution processes for um school for
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
parents so that was already there we
 
03:04:35.550 --> 03:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
were we're just changing the way that it
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
is reviewed um the we already complete
 
03:04:42.429 --> 03:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
the we are already required to re
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
complete a report regarding special
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
education so the only change in this
 
03:04:47.229 --> 03:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
that it would be an annual report that
 
03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
was submitt on September 1st so this is
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
not it's it's just giving us a date that
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
we need to um turn this in and then if
 
03:04:59.630 --> 03:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
you go to page two um line 10 that is
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
just saying that from section one that
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
report that we pull on rejections would
 
03:05:06.349 --> 03:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
be included in the report that's already
 
03:05:08.309 --> 03:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
being done so that would that's all that
 
03:05:08.319 --> 03:05:09.269 align:start position:0%
being done so that would that's all that
that's

03:05:09.269 --> 03:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
adding for the next one the department
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
um yep section three about the office of
 
03:05:17.950 --> 03:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
The Advocate this is something that we
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
um debated consistently because the
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
initial request was to have access to
 
03:05:24.990 --> 03:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
ness's completely and we do not have the
 
03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
ability to only provide access to
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
certain things within nessus it is an
 
03:05:30.630 --> 03:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
old system where we would have to give
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
her access to all students there are
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
currently 32,000 active students within
 
03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
the system and there are
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
175,000 active and inactive students
 
03:05:42.429 --> 03:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
within the system so we felt that we
 
03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
needed to narrow the access to students
 
03:05:47.309 --> 03:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
um to the ones that she was working with
 
03:05:48.910 --> 03:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
so that that was what we talked about
 
03:05:50.910 --> 03:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
for that one and then we were we
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
willingly before we even came to this
 
03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
amendment discussed providing reports
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
from nesses we are able to pull reports
 
03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
from nessus to provide the data that she
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
is looking for um to be able to complete
 
03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:01.469 align:start position:0%
is looking for um to be able to complete
her

03:06:01.469 --> 03:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
processes as I said I'm going to skip
 
03:06:05.790 --> 03:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
number five and then number six is not
 
03:06:08.830 --> 03:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
new it is um I believe Mr Beville had
 
03:06:10.910 --> 03:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
said that it was a new process it is not
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
a new process it was something that was
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
brought up um on page 85 of the dispute
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
resolution process audit where they
 
03:06:19.229 --> 03:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
asked to um ensure training and
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
education includes all relevant
 
03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for Lea special ed dispute
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
resolution compliance and Local District
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
residential uh dispute resolution
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
options so this was saying if we're
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing those options we want to be able
 
03:06:33.070 --> 03:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
we want to know what you're doing and we
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
would want to know what your decisions
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
were through that and that was something
 
03:06:37.950 --> 03:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
big that came up um because we don't
 
03:06:40.030 --> 03:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
know what agreements districts are
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
coming into with parents um we don't
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
know any of that and that was something
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
that came up repeatedly within the
 
03:06:47.950 --> 03:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
audit I think that I covered everything
 
03:06:51.070 --> 03:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
that um we there are a couple other
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
things that have no no um basis on this
 
03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
conversation but we do every District in
 
03:06:58.110 --> 03:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
the state does use nessus so every
 
03:07:00.670 --> 03:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
district has information in in nessus
 
03:07:02.830 --> 03:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
there are four districts currently that
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
do not use it as their IEP system so
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
they have their data which is those
 
03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
those data points for the indicators
 
03:07:10.110 --> 03:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
that we are able to pull from there but
 
03:07:11.790 --> 03:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to pull an IEP
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
because their IEP is at the district
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
level it literally says in some of the
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
sections C file so it's not an official
 
03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
document so there are four districts
 
03:07:21.229 --> 03:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
that currently do not use our system for
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
their IEP every other District in the
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
state does use our system for their IEP
 
03:07:29.590 --> 03:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that was all of them except five and
 
03:07:31.150 --> 03:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
I will answer any questions on all of
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
them except five yeah I I have a
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
question for you then Becky before we go
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
to some of the others why are there four
 
03:07:40.349 --> 03:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
districts that are not using our system
 
03:07:42.269 --> 03:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
they feel that it is cumbersome that it
 
03:07:44.349 --> 03:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
is Antiquated that it is difficult to
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
use um and they are not required to use
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
it except for the data point we actually
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
have a sheet that we provide to them
 
03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
that says these are this is the
 
03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
information that you must put into the
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
system so that we can collect the data
 
03:07:56.910 --> 03:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to report on our indicators
 
03:07:58.950 --> 03:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
is there any accountabilities do you
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
have a hammer of any kind um we do go
 
03:08:03.309 --> 03:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
out and monitor districts and we do look
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
at files um for those districts we they
 
03:08:06.990 --> 03:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
have to actually provide any
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
documentation to us um so and we
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
actually would have to go to their
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
District to see those files if they
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
weren't able to submit them to us so we
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
through our monitoring process we do go
 
03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
out and we look at their files and we do
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
look at their information it just is we
 
03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
aren't able to do a desk audit from the
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
Department in nessus because they don't
 
03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
put that information in
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
there it sort of answers my question a
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
bit but I don't carry a hammer I try to
 
03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess is there some legal reason why
 
03:08:38.830 --> 03:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to do this or is it
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
just because they can't make it work
 
03:08:43.349 --> 03:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
where they are it's just a difficult and
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
I would agree with them it is a
 
03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
difficult system to use it forces you to
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
be compliant it forces you to do certain
 
03:08:50.910 --> 03:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
things so that it is compliant and it's
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
not easy to um navigate if you're not
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
it is that training excuse me we Pro we
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of training it's it's you
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
just have to get used to it it's just
 
03:09:03.150 --> 03:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's very systemic and it has very
 
03:09:04.750 --> 03:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
prescribe things that you can and cannot
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
do represent Terry do you have a
 
03:09:09.389 --> 03:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh following up
 
03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
on the four districts is the
 
03:09:13.389 --> 03:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
identification of the four districts
 
03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
protected by some sort of privacy
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
provision or could you name them for us
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head and then well any
 
03:09:23.229 --> 03:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
of the four and then could you explain
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
the choice of September 1st with respect
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
to line 26 on page one so I I did not
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
choose September 1st but it's not an
 
03:09:31.309 --> 03:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
issue for me because we would be
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
reporting on the previous year's data so
 
03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
we would have all of the data that we
 
03:09:36.990 --> 03:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
need to be able to submit that report by
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um September 1st most of that data we
 
03:09:40.750 --> 03:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
have by July 1 so that would give me
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm the one that would be
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
writing the report it would give me from
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
July 1 to September 1 to write that
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
report because all of that data is is
 
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
read available by that time okay and
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to the four districts you
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
don't know any of them so so you so you
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
know there are four but you don't know
 
03:09:59.070 --> 03:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
who they are I know I know the one we
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
just convinced to move over um I think
 
03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
that um I I would hate to say I wouldn't
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
want to say a district that I'm
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect on I believe I know a couple
 
03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
of them but I don't know all four of
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
them okay so you know that there are
 
03:10:10.269 --> 03:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
four but you just don't know who they
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
interesting other questions represent
 
03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:18.190 align:start position:0%
interesting other questions represent
miler

03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
miler
 
03:10:21.269 --> 03:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
yeah my my thank you for being here
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
you're always welcome here when we're
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
talking about special education issues
 
03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my my is a general question
 
03:10:30.630 --> 03:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
what is the status of the audit right
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
now and when will it be completed sure
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
so the special education audit is um
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
they are continuing to ask us for a
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
request for information um they're
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
continuing to send us um rfis or what
 
03:10:43.389 --> 03:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
they're called and we are at about um
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
RFI number 17 and they have said that
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
they believe they be able to um discuss
 
03:10:51.870 --> 03:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
with us us the report in December um and
 
03:10:53.910 --> 03:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
then it would be issued after that so um
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
it is take just the amount of
 
03:10:56.910 --> 03:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
information that we have it's taking
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
them longer to review it so it has been
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
extended out to um when we would be
 
03:11:02.429 --> 03:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
discussing the report in December so
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
December is the date yeah they I will
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
say that they have issued some of their
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
or um they will be issuing some of their
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
observations already so we already
 
03:11:10.670 --> 03:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
received an observation regarding our
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
state advisory committee and they will
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
be issuing uh four more observations
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
this month to us so that we can start to
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
work on those ahead of um the final
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
report so they do um issue some things
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can start to work on them
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
right away thank you
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
yep Andre she thank you and thank you
 
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question anybody um I'm
 
03:11:32.590 --> 03:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
gonna ask you again about this page two
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
at the bottom where in to assist in
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
fulfillment of the duty to prepare the
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
annual report so if you could describe
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
maybe the reason for this paragraph
 
03:11:42.830 --> 03:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
being in there if the things are online
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
sure so um this is this could be
 
03:11:47.030 --> 03:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
information that is not online because
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
we do have the um nessus database where
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
we are able to pull aggregate
 
03:11:52.950 --> 03:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
information and provide it to her we
 
03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
also have the access database that um is
 
03:11:57.510 --> 03:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the office of governance that
 
03:11:59.309 --> 03:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
contains all of this this dispute
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
resolution processes so while you have
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
all of these specific things we would be
 
03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
able to aggregate it into one report and
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
say in the state this is what it looks
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
like you're welcome um and Diana just
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
reminded me we had asked about rule
 
03:12:13.990 --> 03:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
making um so we do have rules that are
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
coming up next year we have rules that
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
are coming up the year after we have
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
rules that coming up the year after so
 
03:12:20.429 --> 03:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
they don't all expire at the same time
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
but they are expiring gradually over the
 
03:12:23.229 --> 03:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
next few
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
years for Special
 
03:12:28.590 --> 03:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
Education First bets yeah yes representa
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair um and
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here today to uh to
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
take some technical questions um with
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
respect to sections 1 and six how does
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
the department um
 
03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
presently enforce um the process and
 
03:12:48.110 --> 03:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
timelines when it comes to dispute
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
resolutions and uh talking about both
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
both Department U processes and um and
 
03:12:57.389 --> 03:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution that may be taking
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
place through the um through the the Lea
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
through the the local school
 
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
district um So currently we are working
 
03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
on processes for this um the for for
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
section one we had not been doing this
 
03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
um we had not been collecting rejections
 
03:13:14.790 --> 03:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
from districts and nor had the office of
 
03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
governance neither office had been
 
03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
collecting this um and so we have
 
03:13:19.950 --> 03:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
started to develop that process of how
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
we would be pulling the reports and what
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
we would be doing to meet that
 
03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
obligation um for six as I said that has
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
always been in there but it has always
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
been a may and or is encouraged to so we
 
03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
never asked for dispute resolution plans
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
from leas nor had we ever asked them
 
03:13:37.630 --> 03:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
what um decisions had been made within
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
their districts regarding dispute
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
resolution so those are both processes
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
that we would be working on we have our
 
03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
one of our technical assistance centers
 
03:13:45.510 --> 03:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
coming this summer to work with us to
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
fine-tune all of our processes and
 
03:13:48.429 --> 03:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're meeting all the
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
requirements around dispute resolution
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
so follow up on that yes so so thanks so
 
03:13:57.389 --> 03:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
so do you do you actually need state law
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
to um for the Department to to
 
03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
um enforce the you know existing you
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
know policies do you need state law to
 
03:14:11.070 --> 03:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
you know to implement you know good
 
03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:12.229 align:start position:0%
you know to implement you know good
management

03:14:12.229 --> 03:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
practices uh you know are I guess what
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
why is the department
 
03:14:20.550 --> 03:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
waiting why why can't the department
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and put in good management
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
practices so I don't think the first um
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
you are referring to one and six I don't
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
think the first one is a management
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
process it was we are changing it so
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
that it's not something the districts
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
have to submit to us in writing we're
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
going to pull it electronically because
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
it had been the districts are the onus
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
was on the districts and we're taking on
 
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
the responsibility and saying we're
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to pull that report and we're
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
going to do it internally rather than
 
03:14:44.190 --> 03:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
expect the districts to plan send it to
 
03:14:45.790 --> 03:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
us so that's what the change is in the
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
first one it's not really manag IAL it's
 
03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
more of we're going to change who's
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for that process and ensure
 
03:14:52.990 --> 03:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
that that process is done for the second
 
03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.349 align:start position:0%
that that process is done for the second
one

03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that we in discussions with
 
03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
the Auditors I think that it was felt
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we needed to um ensure that what
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
was going on in districts was happening
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
but this I'm going to let Diana refer to
 
03:15:10.309 --> 03:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
this one I
 
03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
think thank you I think and the audit
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
even says this is that historically the
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
department has not played a very AG Rive
 
03:15:20.750 --> 03:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
active role and so in doing so and and I
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned during the audit review here
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we had a very robust discussion
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
with the Auditors about their position
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
that the department had more authority
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
to oversee this area of local school
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
districts than historically the
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
department has played and so this change
 
03:15:39.550 --> 03:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
of language uh addresses that and allows
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
the department to do
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
that so Diana I I I'm still trying to
 
03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
Grapple with the the question that
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
myself and represent Terry addressed
 
03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
these four districts you have oversight
 
03:15:55.630 --> 03:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
as a department over special education
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
in those schools as well and if the
 
03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
special education Advocate is going to
 
03:16:04.269 --> 03:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
have to go individually to these schools
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether there's a paper
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
file or what they're doing there uh to
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
obtain information it seems to me
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's something not right here if if
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're allowing well you decide whether
 
03:16:19.389 --> 03:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
you want to be part the database or not
 
03:16:24.189 --> 03:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
um is that a a decision is being made by
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
our doe or is it being made by local
 
03:16:30.030 --> 03:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
control it's either the rule or the
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
statute says that they may use it they
 
03:16:33.389 --> 03:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
are not required to use it and that's
 
03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
why we don't we can't enforce them
 
03:16:39.630 --> 03:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
information they may use the database
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
yes and then there are Point data points
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
that they must enter in but they it's
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
only a may use the database so it's not
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
like the unique uh like the pupil
 
03:16:54.670 --> 03:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
identifier where they're required to put
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
individual data in this is a separate
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
system yes yes I understand that then
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
why don't we have the same rules for you
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
participate here you're also going to
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
have to participate here it's because
 
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
statute we blown it it it says may
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's why then that's what's always
 
03:17:13.189 --> 03:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
been the cas is that it's May so nessus
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
is created by Ru making and part of it
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
is mandatory which is a sh and part of
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
it is a May so there are certain data
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
points that they must report and there
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
are others that they may report and so I
 
03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on the special so
 
03:17:32.429 --> 03:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
under the IED indicator number five
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
where you have the three categories
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
Becky you know what I'm talking about do
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
they report that information to you yes
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
they report that in nessus that would be
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
one of the data points that we require
 
03:17:43.710 --> 03:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
them to put into the system so that we
 
03:17:45.870 --> 03:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
can collect that data so that is through
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
um the placement page for the IEP and it
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
would be the services page for the
 
03:17:51.870 --> 03:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
students so that information must be put
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
into the into the system so that we can
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
calculate that data so are they using
 
03:17:59.710 --> 03:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
this system partially part for those
 
03:18:01.630 --> 03:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
data pieces that we need yes they are
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
partially using it because they all must
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
turn in the data and they and that's how
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
nesses okay further questions from the
 
03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee it sounds like they have
 
03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
access they know how to use it but
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
they're choosing not to use it for this
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
right and many of them pay for another
 
03:18:19.790 --> 03:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
system to of those four I believe they
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
pay for another system to use so there
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
are other systems out there not necess
 
03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.910 --> 03:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork okay any other questions for
 
03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
the Department do you want she's going
 
03:18:35.229 --> 03:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
to talk would you like would you like me
 
03:18:37.150 --> 03:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
to address yes absolutely from the legal
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
side yes so um I have one point on the
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
moou that I think I just want to make
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
sure before I get to five so um it would
 
03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
be oneou that we would have between our
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
agency and the special education
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
Advocate agency which is a separate
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
agency the fact that we have M with
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
other agencies when we do data sharing
 
03:18:59.389 --> 03:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
is just how it's done I think we have
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
about 10 m with the Department of um
 
03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS for different data that we we share
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it is to protect that data and is to
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that it is clear between the
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
two agencies because we are separate
 
03:19:13.790 --> 03:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
agencies how that data is going to be
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
utilized how that data is going to be
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
protected and what precautions are going
 
03:19:19.229 --> 03:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
to be put on that data it's standard
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
practice there would be oneou we're not
 
03:19:23.950 --> 03:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
talking about multiple M us for every
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
parent that the special education
 
03:19:27.429 --> 03:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
Advocate might be trying to assist I
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
think that's an important thing that was
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
discussed a few times here and I just
 
03:19:32.710 --> 03:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure standard practice we
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
have many M us with many other agencies
 
03:19:37.630 --> 03:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS being one of the most common that
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have many data sharing agreements
 
03:19:42.269 --> 03:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
with any questions about that before I
 
03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
deal with number five which pretty much
 
03:19:46.110 --> 03:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
took up our morning we do represent B
 
03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:47.710 align:start position:0%
took up our morning we do represent B
bony

03:19:47.710 --> 03:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
bony
 
03:19:49.229 --> 03:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you just
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that that data sharing
 
03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
that personal information could be
 
03:19:57.630 --> 03:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
shared now the special education
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
advocate office is an independent agency
 
03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the department so there has
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
been legislation uh going through right
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
now that talk about the sharing of
 
03:20:12.269 --> 03:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
personally PB Pi information and that
 
03:20:15.189 --> 03:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
parental consent is required um could
 
03:20:18.189 --> 03:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
you just speak to that for
 
03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
me so um thank you for your question um
 
03:20:25.229 --> 03:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
it is that legislation that is currently
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
pending and now my computer is 1690 is
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
completely a brick because that's how
 
03:20:33.630 --> 03:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
long the battery lasted um we would have
 
03:20:35.229 --> 03:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
the that would be one of the things that
 
03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
we would have to make sure that we
 
03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
covered if that law it's ought to pass
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
so it probably does we would have to
 
03:20:43.389 --> 03:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have determined who um
 
03:20:45.870 --> 03:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
has the burden of notifying the parents
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
that that information
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be um shared and that is a
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that is a um point that we have had uh
 
03:20:56.309 --> 03:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
conversation that we have had with the
 
03:20:58.349 --> 03:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
special education advocate in getting
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
here so there was a lot of conversations
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
when I I think when representative
 
03:21:03.189 --> 03:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
cordelli said this is like maybe draft
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 that is accurate and that that
 
03:21:08.469 --> 03:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
law that um legislation that is
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
currently pending was one of the factors
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we discuss because we want to
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
anything that we do now and we create
 
03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
that data sharing would have to be
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with all all data privacy
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
laws all the ones that already currently
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
exist as well um which includes the ones
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
under 189 which is sort of one of my
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
niches there at the department um
 
03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
because we have to make sure that we
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
have a report that
 
03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
indicates every time that our data has
 
03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
been accessed so that's we have a
 
03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
reporting obligation for that so it's a
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that's going through but
 
03:21:45.150 --> 03:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's also something that we would have
 
03:21:47.710 --> 03:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our would cover and
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're complying with all
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the laws that's the reason if you
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
think about why we need M us is because
 
03:21:57.070 --> 03:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different facets of laws
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
and information that has to be protected
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
and thatou is a way that the two
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
agencies can come together and make sure
 
03:22:06.670 --> 03:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
that we are doing it in compliance with
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
all of the applicable laws does that
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
answer your question thank you are there
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
03:22:15.229 --> 03:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you thank you Mr
 
03:22:18.349 --> 03:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
chair um I guess I have a concern you
 
03:22:21.389 --> 03:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
know we've have we have this
 
03:22:24.630 --> 03:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
report which you're very familiar with
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and you have an audit that's
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
pending what is the urgency for this at
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
this point in time I I am concerned
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
about the last minute nature of this not
 
03:22:40.510 --> 03:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
withstanding the work that's been done
 
03:22:43.229 --> 03:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
the number of drafts that's been done
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
but why now I mean why wouldn't we want
 
03:22:50.229 --> 03:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
to look at the the whole topic of this
 
03:22:53.309 --> 03:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate time and do this in a
 
03:22:56.189 --> 03:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
very definitive kind of a way rather
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
than in the 11th Hour rush it
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
through why now why can't we why can't
 
03:23:04.110 --> 03:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
we wait that's my question so
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative Myer um thank you for
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
your question I'm not sure I'm the best
 
03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
person to answer that question this was
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
brought to me as um a bill to look at it
 
03:23:19.150 --> 03:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
was not something that I know uh I mean
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
that I was that I that I was aware that
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
the department was driving I don't
 
03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
believe we were driving it I think there
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
were conversations that were had between
 
03:23:28.990 --> 03:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton and the special
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
education Advocate regarding data
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
sharing um that prompted probably this
 
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
bill and so I think that I think the
 
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
data sharing was probably what drove it
 
03:23:41.229 --> 03:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't know I cannot speak to the
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
urgency I'm sorry who who who of the
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
department can answer that question for
 
03:23:48.910 --> 03:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
me why now I think the short answer
 
03:23:51.070 --> 03:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Miler is that um the
 
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
feeling was wanting to be responsive to
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
the audit and some of the concerns that
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
were raised and that was something that
 
03:23:59.229 --> 03:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
we talked about when we brought this
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
audit in front of this legislative body
 
03:24:04.349 --> 03:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
was that uh I think representative lad
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
brought up the point that there were
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
some retain bills that could be utilized
 
03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
to start to address some of these uh
 
03:24:12.429 --> 03:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised that was the
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
disc thank
 
03:24:19.189 --> 03:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
you okay now if I can try to address um
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph five which was honestly not a
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
provision that I was prepared to speak
 
03:24:26.790 --> 03:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
on today did not anticipate that this
 
03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
was going to take up the bulk of the day
 
03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:30.750 align:start position:0%
was going to take up the bulk of the day
um

03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:33.870 --> 03:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
so we have and and representative belter
 
03:24:36.670 --> 03:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
very early asked the question of what is
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
our rul making Authority with respect to
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
special education the special education
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
Ru making Authority there's four rsas
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
that give the department rule making
 
03:24:52.870 --> 03:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
Authority one is RSA 21 N9 um Ro I uh
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
one which basically says with we can uh
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
that uh State Board of Education can um
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
adopt rules dealing of pro programs
 
03:25:03.990 --> 03:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
affecting children with
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities the second area is under
 
03:25:10.269 --> 03:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
186 C5 which is for program
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
approval third is 186 c18 ran numeral 5
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
gives the State Board rule making
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
authority to determine for state aid and
 
03:25:22.349 --> 03:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
the last one and I did them out of order
 
03:25:26.670 --> 03:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
on purpose is a broad one which is 186
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
c16 that's rulemaking and it is the
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
section where this language that um is
 
03:25:36.269 --> 03:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
in five is getting appended to what I
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
would call the catch-all phrase at the
 
03:25:40.750 --> 03:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
end of the statute so we'll talk a
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about statutory construction
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
here because I think that's really
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
important this
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
rulle making Authority Under 186 c16
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
says the State Board of Education shall
 
03:25:55.150 --> 03:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
adopt rules pursuant to 541a that's the
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
standard rule we all have to adopt rules
 
03:25:59.550 --> 03:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
under and consistent with the provision
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
for a free appropriate public education
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
relative to and it enumerates a long
 
03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
list of things one developing individual
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
educa individualized education programs
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
two approving and monitor special
 
03:26:16.389 --> 03:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
education programs three reporting a
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
number of children with disabilities in
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
school districts four requesting
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
administrative due process hearings and
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
appealing a final administrative
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
decision Roman numeral five determining
 
03:26:28.870 --> 03:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility for participation in
 
03:26:31.349 --> 03:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
approved programs Roman numeral six
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
appointing surrogate parents Roman
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
numeral 7 determining the length of the
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
school year for children with
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then we finally get to
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 8 which is the catchall
 
03:26:44.189 --> 03:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
which is where we spent all day talking
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
it says other matters related to
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
complying with the provisions of this
 
03:26:52.110 --> 03:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
chapter it's a catch up now remember
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
every rule that we go to to gel car we
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
have to cite what our statutory
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
Authority is so sitting back there I
 
03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
went and did a quick search where is the
 
03:27:06.670 --> 03:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
only times that we ever rely upon y86
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
c16 Roman numeral 8 in our rule making
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
our current Ru making we do it
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
twice one is the definition of parent in
 
03:27:17.120 --> 03:27:20.269 align:start position:0%
twice one is the definition of parent in
rule

03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.429 --> 03:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
11204 and and so that in a
 
03:27:29.710 --> 03:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
definition the second place is um in
 
03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:31.670 align:start position:0%
definition the second place is um in
11

03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
11
 
03:27:34.030 --> 03:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
13.12 it's the only other time that we
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
site to it in that one it's a rule
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with Personnel for special
 
03:27:41.790 --> 03:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
education programs in addition to this
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
catchall provision that we used there is
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
a three different Federal cfrs that are
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
cited for our rule making Authority for
 
03:27:52.269 --> 03:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
that Personnel rule so this catchall
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
provision is really only used once ever
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
so when the amendment says that we're
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to when we use that catchall that
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
catchall has to be limited to it can't
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
exceed state or federal minimum
 
03:28:08.670 --> 03:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
requirements unless the rule is
 
03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by Statute this
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
is a tiny tiny exception we have many
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
1100 rules and we really never Ed this
 
03:28:22.269 --> 03:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
exception so the all the discussion
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard today from the parent
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
groups that feel that their all of the
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
rules are going to get destroyed because
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
of this language being appended to the
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
catchall phrase at the end are
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
misconstruing the statute and are
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
misconstruing statutory construction
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
rules of how we are how how you draft
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
statutes and how the attorney fitt and I
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
interpret the statutes that are drafted
 
03:28:48.429 --> 03:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really important point
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
that this is the catchall at the end
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very tiny very tiny part of
 
03:28:55.229 --> 03:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
the rule making Authority that the
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
department has and has really only been
 
03:29:01.469 --> 03:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
used twice in the history of our 1100
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
rules so I think that kind of EX sets
 
03:29:09.150 --> 03:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
the tone for how narrow this addition is
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
and is why when I read this I wasn't
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
focused upon this language as changing
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
much of anything in our rules because
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that we are using
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
and I was more focused when I was
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this proposed legislation
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that I was protecting the
 
03:29:25.870 --> 03:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
data privacy of our special education
 
03:29:27.790 --> 03:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
students that were in our system and
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure the special
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
education Advocate had the tools that
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
she needed to be able to do her job
 
03:29:35.550 --> 03:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
because that's what I was hearing her
 
03:29:37.389 --> 03:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
frustration was that she didn't think
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
she had the tools and she felt like she
 
03:29:41.469 --> 03:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
needed certain aspects of this so this
 
03:29:43.870 --> 03:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
is why we were not focused on this
 
03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
language and um and so it's a I think
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of I think if you
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
understand the rul making process I
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to remember
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we have to cite statutory Authority
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
every time we adopt an administrative
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
Rule and we are not relying upon this
 
03:30:03.229 --> 03:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
very small exception I'm happy to answer
 
03:30:05.469 --> 03:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
any questions if I've confused anyone
 
03:30:08.429 --> 03:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
tried not to um the ru making process I
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
believe is a laborious process and it's
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
very detail oriented um and I think it's
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
very important when we are talking about
 
03:30:18.830 --> 03:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
statute that we are focusing on the
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
actual language on the page and not
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
allowing a very a catchall at the end of
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
a very specific statute authorizing the
 
03:30:29.910 --> 03:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education to adopt
 
03:30:32.070 --> 03:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
numerous different categories of rules
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
to allow a very small part catchall at
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
the end basically wipe out all of the
 
03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
other statutory Authority the department
 
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
that the State Board of Education I
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
should not misspeak the State Board of
 
03:30:45.189 --> 03:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
Education has with respect to rul making
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:46.479 --> 03:30:47.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
represent

03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:30:50.429 --> 03:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you all
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
for being
 
03:30:51.479 --> 03:30:54.510 align:start position:0%
for being
here

03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:58.389 --> 03:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
um so I need some either repeated or
 
03:30:58.399 --> 03:30:59.429 align:start position:0%
um so I need some either repeated or
further

03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:31:01.870 --> 03:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
explanation Miss Brown from sometimes I
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't yeah okay you may well have said
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
it just fine but I have not got it
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
yet so can I can I help you well let me
 
03:31:13.870 --> 03:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
please so lines 1 to three on page
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
three the only part of that that's
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
currently in statute correct me if I'm
 
03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
wrong is the phrase other matters
 
03:31:26.429 --> 03:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
related to complying with precisions of
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
correct correct so when you indicated a
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
moment ago that this has only been used
 
03:31:34.680 --> 03:31:36.670 align:start position:0%
moment ago that this has only been used
twice

03:31:36.670 --> 03:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
twice
 
03:31:41.229 --> 03:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
ever that twice ever doesn't include the
 
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
drafted language beginning provided and
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
and through lines two and three great
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't that language
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
considerably uh change the meeting to a
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
much greater catch-all frankly I'm I'm
 
03:31:59.229 --> 03:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
reading this from my prior experience
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
kind of like the end of a job
 
03:32:02.429 --> 03:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
description and other duties as may be
 
03:32:04.030 --> 03:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
required which means we can tell you we
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
have to do anything which pretty much
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
explains how I ended up here today um
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm the only one that laughed at
 
03:32:10.080 --> 03:32:12.750 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm the only one that laughed at
that

03:32:12.750 --> 03:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
so the catch all as
 
03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
written could be super broad but even as
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
super broad it's not being
 
03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
utilized so adding this language would
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
re would restrict the number of times
 
03:32:39.429 --> 03:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
that that the agency could rely upon
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
this other matters relating to special
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
education but it doesn't change any of
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
the other existing rules that we have
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
that all the parent protection all the
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
due process all of the other the things
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
that would that people were saying if
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
you if you put this in we're going to
 
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
lose our ability to have our current
 
03:33:00.830 --> 03:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
rules the other rules have separate
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and they are
 
03:33:05.710 --> 03:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
authorized by separate statutory
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
Authority if you go through the 1100
 
03:33:10.269 --> 03:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
rules at the bottom of the 1100 rules
 
03:33:13.229 --> 03:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see a table you don't and I can't
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
even show at the at the bottom and for
 
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
each individual rule it will map to what
 
03:33:23.070 --> 03:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
the statutory Authority is for us to be
 
03:33:25.389 --> 03:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
for the um state board to be able to
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
adopt that rule if we can't link it to a
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
car yes go
 
03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
ahead thank
 
03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:43.269 align:start position:0%
ahead thank
you

03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:33:47.710 --> 03:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
so if this section five lines 1 to three
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
statute then would it be correct that
 
03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
that could then be used as a rationale
 
03:33:59.229 --> 03:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
for any rule no it's not correct
 
03:34:02.389 --> 03:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
because the all the we
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
have four
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
different rules that allow us to to have
 
03:34:10.269 --> 03:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
03:34:13.710 --> 03:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
Authority this is if you read it in
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
context 186 C 16 has a list of statutory
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
Authority that's independent of Roman
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
eight go ahead she speaks lawyer speak
 
03:34:34.189 --> 03:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I sometimes don't um so what what
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that the only things
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
that fall under number eight are the
 
03:34:40.790 --> 03:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
definition of a parent and then
 
03:34:43.189 --> 03:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
Personnel Personnel every other rule
 
03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
that we have falls under those other
 
03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
categor above eight they all relate to
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
those other categories they do not
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
relate to this
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
one and that
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
language that they're tacking on only
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
relates to eight because that's how
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
statute that's statutory construction
 
03:35:05.710 --> 03:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
you can't take language at the last
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
sentence and make it change one to S if
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
you took that clause and you put it in
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
the introductory paragraph before that
 
03:35:15.399 --> 03:35:16.150 align:start position:0%
the introductory paragraph before that
list

03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
the one to one to Roman numeral 8 then
 
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
that Clause would modify one to eight
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
but because it's only in eight it only
 
03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:25.950 align:start position:0%
but because it's only in eight it only
modifies

03:35:25.950 --> 03:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
modifies
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
eight that's just a a statutory
 
03:35:33.870 --> 03:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.269 --> 03:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
if Luna yeah thank you thank you Mr
 
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um uh attorney Brown
 
03:35:44.670 --> 03:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
for for that but um but I I guess um you
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
know Roman 8 talks about Provisions in
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
this chapter and the chapter isn't 16
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
the chapter is 186c right that's the
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
chapter the chap the chapter is defining
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
special education right 186 186 or
 
03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
186c which one is the
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
chapter 186 C 186 C so eight
 
03:36:19.950 --> 03:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
Roman 8 refers to all of
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
186c and I and and I I guess
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding your interpretation of
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
this but would would another lawyer
 
03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
potentially have a different
 
03:36:35.070 --> 03:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the um of of how the
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the the new language language in
 
03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
bold uh the part that begins with
 
03:36:42.990 --> 03:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
provided in no case uh shall could
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
another attorney interpret um the
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
applicability of that different
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
different from how you've interpreted
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
that there's always a lawyer on the
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
other side that's right respect thank
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
you for your question but I mean I I
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
don't I I think it's a bit of a trick
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
question yes of course there's always a
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's going to argue something
 
03:37:05.790 --> 03:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
different but I think it would be
 
03:37:07.870 --> 03:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
against the general cannons and tenants
 
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
of statutory construction no no I I I I
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um but but it isn't that
 
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing from from from people
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
today that they don't want to be subject
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
to an attorney who might look at
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
this 10 years from
 
03:37:31.150 --> 03:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
now and say hey you know what that
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
applies to all of 186c I mean could
 
03:37:37.349 --> 03:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
could you could you you know empathize
 
03:37:41.229 --> 03:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
concern uh thank you for your question I
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a correct
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation I think it would be a
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
very contorted reading of this statute
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
um especially in light of the
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
existing administrative rules and the
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
number of other statutes that we are
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
citing for Authority that has nothing to
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
do with the rule making authority of the
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
8 statutory construction representative
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
bone well thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question question um
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
then my question is if it only pertains
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
to those two categories that you're
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
talking about uh parents and Personnel
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
why is it in
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
here um thank you for your question
 
03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
um I I didn't you mean the existing
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral eight why is it
 
03:38:36.600 --> 03:38:38.110 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral eight why is it
there

03:38:38.110 --> 03:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um respectfully I'd have to go back to
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory history um and and see
 
03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
what was thought of when it was put
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
there it looks like the last time the
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
statute was looked at was in 2009 and I
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
was doing corporate and commercial law
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
back then so I I apologize I I don't
 
03:39:00.030 --> 03:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
know why the catch all was was put there
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
respectfully sorry not much help are
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
there further questions represent
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
and for trying to make this clear to
 
03:39:11.279 --> 03:39:12.990 align:start position:0%
and for trying to make this clear to
us

03:39:12.990 --> 03:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the first word in that
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
sentence of Roman numeral 8 which says
 
03:39:23.429 --> 03:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
other matters and when it says other
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
matters does that mean other than Roman
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
numerals 1 through 7 and so that's why
 
03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:31.469 align:start position:0%
numerals 1 through 7 and so that's why
it

03:39:31.469 --> 03:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
is pertains just to eight um thank you
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
for your question represented like
 
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
because that's how I read this is
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
because there are seven specifically
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
enumerated categories and then it number
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
eight is other matters that maybe we
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
haven't specifically enumerated is
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
exactly how I read
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
this thank you further further yes
 
03:39:57.080 --> 03:39:59.790 align:start position:0%
this thank you further further yes
represent

03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
whitcock good afternoon good afternoon
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for waiting around CL and
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
Clarity um I would follow up on
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
represent L's question about the
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
attorney versus attorney obviously this
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
morning we've heard multiple who did had
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
a different concern of parents concern
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
um taking your interpretation as
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
accurate and taking the fact you said
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
this is only been used twice basically
 
03:40:22.640 --> 03:40:23.950 align:start position:0%
this is only been used twice basically
this

03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
provision why is the new addition even
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
in there why why is why is this portion
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's causing so much um discontent
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
it's only used such a rare time in
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
past um thank you for your question
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock again um I'm not
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
sure that I can answer that um like I
 
03:40:46.830 --> 03:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
said this was not a provision that I
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
focused on I was really uh focusing upon
 
03:40:52.830 --> 03:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
the data privacy issues and trying to
 
03:40:54.750 --> 03:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
get the special education Advocate the
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
information that she needed and when I
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
read this I just did not see that it was
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
a significant change okay um in the law
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
and that's how I viewed it that's fine
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
open that M chair yes so to the chair
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
represent um neither one of us proposed
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
these we were asked to work
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
we were asked to work on these um they
 
03:41:19.990 --> 03:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
were presented to us by The Advocate and
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli so we were asked
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
to work on these and give our provide
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
our input for them so I don't know where
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
um I believe that Advocate um and I
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
can't say her last name either I believe
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
Kristen had said um that she she and U
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli had conversation
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
with parents but that would just be me
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
repeating what she had said Thank you
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman are there
 
03:41:41.469 --> 03:41:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Miler thank you
 
03:41:43.229 --> 03:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair not to belay with this point
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
but uh just an observation
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh attorney Brown while while you
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
were speaking about your uh item 11
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
there it was interesting as I was
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
watching the crowd behind you I had some
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
people going like this other people
 
03:42:02.189 --> 03:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
going like this which is an indication I
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
think of the complexity of what we're
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
talking about here then just a comment I
 
03:42:10.990 --> 03:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
think one of the dilemmas that I I felt
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
this morning as I was listening to the
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh testimony was the question of
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
trust trust about the language and how
 
03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
it can be interpreted by those parents
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
who are
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
fearful of uh losing something that they
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
currently have and I don't know how you
 
03:42:32.189 --> 03:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the qu in my mind the question
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
of trust without the engagement of more
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
people involved in the creation of the
 
03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
language particularly as it relates to
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
the and I I've said this a couple times
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm very concerned about
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
the audit and the pending results of the
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
audit and clearly the issue of what this
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
committee has heard throughout my 12
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
years here anytime you deal with the
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
issue of special education because
 
03:43:00.670 --> 03:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with parents you're
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with kids you're dealing with
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
relationships the relationships that
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
start prechool that move all the way
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
through and that's a very tenuous kind
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
of a situation where you're trying to
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
have parents and the and an institution
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
that provides services to students and
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it's so important for the future of
 
03:43:24.990 --> 03:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
their children and so my uh my concern
 
03:43:28.110 --> 03:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
is the last minute thing here without
 
03:43:31.830 --> 03:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
the without the uh opportunity for the
 
03:43:34.189 --> 03:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
engagement and I know that engagement is
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult but in the end if the
 
03:43:39.309 --> 03:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
engagement is there and there is some
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
sense of understanding what those
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
changes need to be to comply with this
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
audit or the pending results of the
 
03:43:48.269 --> 03:43:48.279 align:start position:0%
other audit it just seems to me that
 
03:43:50.429 --> 03:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
this this bill is premature at this
 
03:43:52.469 --> 03:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
point in time because we haven't had
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of Engagement and I appreciate
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
your being here and trying to provide
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
some clarity for us thank you very much
 
03:44:04.110 --> 03:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%

03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
and and I do appreciate your work in
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do this I do because it's
 
03:44:22.120 --> 03:44:29.429 align:start position:0%
trying to do this I do because it's
important

03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.349 --> 03:44:38.359 align:start position:0%

we're going to open up the exec session
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
for SB 378 so we're probably streaming
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
now for the okay for the information of
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
the committee we had another amendment
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
which the subcommittee was working off
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's 1679 H which you should have in
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
your folders which we had and what has
 
04:20:10.750 --> 04:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
been done
 
04:20:14.830 --> 04:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
subsequently multiple visits with doe
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
and with the L legislative Services
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
across the way they found several areas
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that needed Corrections so there was
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
another amendment made which says 1898
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
H and what I've done on 1898 i' made
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
another copy highlighting and bold those
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
areas which are
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
changes and I'll just take you right
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
through it comparing the amendment we
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
were given last week and this amendment
 
04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
right here and where the changes are are
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
compared to the
 
04:20:49.870 --> 04:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
two but where is represent
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
Heath you're going to call okay okay
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay good let's let's go ahead and start
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
then on on this bill
 
04:21:00.910 --> 04:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
378 this is a bill that deals with a per
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
U BL blah blah performance-based
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
accountability system which we have we
 
04:21:07.229 --> 04:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
have the input system and the
 
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
performance system which we measure and
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
the PBS pbas needs some refine we've
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
been talking about a task force to do
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that on on the amendment on on line
 
04:21:26.349 --> 04:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
7 through n that remains unchanged from
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment you saw the other day it's
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
the same there is hereby established a

performance-based accountability system
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
that will serve to demonstrate that a
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
school is providing the opportunity for
 
04:21:40.109 --> 04:21:40.119 align:start position:0%
an adequate education has to find in
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%

had in the uh original Amendment it said
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%

04:22:25.710 --> 04:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
that's gone we talked about that in the
 
04:22:28.750 --> 04:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so you'll see the first a
 
04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
on line 12 where it says this is where
 
04:22:33.109 --> 04:22:33.119 align:start position:0%
it starts the
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
members six or more individuals who hold
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
a current New Hampshire certification of
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent assistant superintendent
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
or curriculum administrator there shall
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
be at least at least one representative
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
of each of the five New Hampshire school
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
administrative Association
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
administrative regions and one Statewide
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
at large
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative the Statewide regions are
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
five that are set up by the New
 
04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrator
 
04:23:00.269 --> 04:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
Association but also that terminology is
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
used by Homeland Security that's trying
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
to identify the regions we have in our
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
state is that correct Nate I believe
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what Kate Caitlyn told me
 
04:23:15.630 --> 04:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
Nate okay so going down to the next on B
 
04:23:19.229 --> 04:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
on line 16 of the new Amendment it says
 
04:23:21.109 --> 04:23:21.119 align:start position:0%
two individuals who hold a current New
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certification uh principle um
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
that was in the original that's in the
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
original so there's no change there
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
C uh which is line
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
17 uh it says two individuals who hold a
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire educator license
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
as classroom teachers one Elementary one
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
secondary who are familiar with the
 
04:23:44.159 --> 04:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
secondary who are familiar with the
performance-based

04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
performance-based
 
04:23:48.670 --> 04:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
accountability um with performance-based
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
accountability and work in the role of
 
04:23:53.950 --> 04:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher in a school that was
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
also in the First Amendment uh on in
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
1679 each so there's nothing changed
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
there going on down it says other
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
educational experts who whose
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of performance-based
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
accountability and expertise will be a
 
04:24:13.950 --> 04:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to the task force duties so if
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
you add up a B and C 6 22 that's 10 and
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
then other would be the other five
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
members so we had from nine through but
 
04:24:29.590 --> 04:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
we took out we took out the one current
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
School Board member which could be part
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
of the other five if you wanted a school
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
board member it was decided when I was
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
working with the Department that there's
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
probably not a whole lot of school board
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
members are familiar with the
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
yes so under the explanation you've just
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
the well let's wait a second because TS
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
were now we've moved it we've moved it
 
04:25:04.590 --> 04:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
further down so now you have before in
 
04:25:06.389 --> 04:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
this it went to the Department Personnel
 
04:25:07.950 --> 04:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
shall advise facilitate provide
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
technical support that's gone and we've
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
tried to put on what are the
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of doe what are the
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the task force not
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
mixing them up throughout so let's go
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
down the the a new Amendment it says the
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education shall appoint
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
task force members after consultation
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
with professional education
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
organizations and stakeholder groups
 
04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
with relevant assessment and
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
accountability expertise we talked about
 
04:25:39.550 --> 04:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
doing that we wanted the stakeholder
 
04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups engaged that now it
 
04:25:46.750 --> 04:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
has it uh two the department uh on B on
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
line 25 the department shall advise
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%

had going on down and and U going for
 
04:26:04.830 --> 04:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
let's see um I want to make sure I'm not
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
jumping around here yeah three then you
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
go down to and you can see on on B it
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
came from 167 9 was 2A page 1 lines
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
27-28 that's been scrapped and it's been

B through F come from the original
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
document or the original uh Amendment
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
but we added in G the task force shall
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
review and make recommendations of the
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%

alternative schools that was we
 
04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
discussed that and we'd like to have
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
that in there
 
04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
um H was there already that's not new
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's just coming over from the other
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh see going on down to line
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
17 through
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
20 uh the department May provide stiens
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
mileage expense reimbursements to
 
04:29:02.030 --> 04:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
members of the task force established in
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
the section as well as make expenditures
 
04:29:06.109 --> 04:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
of other costs associated with the
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
administration of the taxk force has
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
determined to be appropriate by the
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
department that was Roman four on page
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
two in that other Amendment we looked at
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
so that's no change is saying the
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
department will take care of that
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
mileage and all that for the people
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
participating in the task
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
force uh on 21 through
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
24 the any unexpended funds for the bium
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th 2025 and each bium
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
thereafter if this thing
 
04:29:38.590 --> 04:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
pursues uh in those accounts shall not
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
lapse and that all that language came
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
over from the other one so what we're
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to make sure that it
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
it's not just stops at June 25 the
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation of dollars it can continue
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
in other
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
banum on 25 through
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
2930 um the task force shall develop a
 
04:30:02.349 --> 04:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
performance-based scoring system which
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
shall be based on data and indicators
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
which are already provided to the
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
department Andor performance measures
 
04:30:10.030 --> 04:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
that schools are already required to
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
provide the department under under other
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
state or federal laws in establishing
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
the performance-based system the the
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
task force may consider one or more of
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
the following data and data and
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
indicators and that was Romans 6 page 2
 
04:30:24.800 --> 04:30:25.550 align:start position:0%
indicators and that was Romans 6 page 2
in

04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
1679 note that using only the best
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
available accountability system was
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
systems system was deleted as we asked
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that occur so that flipped over in
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
there and we took out um everything else
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
on page two just comes over from that
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
other amendment that the subcommittee
 
04:30:43.840 --> 04:30:45.469 align:start position:0%
other amendment that the subcommittee
talked

04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
talked
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
about and then the other change is
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
starts on line four on page three the
 
04:30:55.109 --> 04:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
performance-based school accountability
 
04:30:58.030 --> 04:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
system ver verification process that's
 
04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
already in statute but we're amending it
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
to read uh uh RSA 193e 3D to read as
 
04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
follows um um and it's down below and we
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
Chang the uh RSA reference not to four
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
but to Roman 8 as it is now in this
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
amendment so those changes it's it's
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
clean up from both OS and from the
 
04:31:27.000 --> 04:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
clean up from both OS and from the
Department

04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes so I was curious with the phrase
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
saw oh I'm sorry yes so I'm curious
 
04:31:45.550 --> 04:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to the two mentions at the
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
very least of as needed and as needed on
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
page one and I'm going to surmise by
 
04:31:55.870 --> 04:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
what I read on line three of Page Three
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
that the as needed is all deliver is is
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
driven by the report due date of no
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
later than June 30th 2026 well would
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
that be correct on page 26 on page one
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
lines 26 and 27 where it does end up as
 
04:32:10.960 --> 04:32:12.750 align:start position:0%
lines 26 and 27 where it does end up as
needed

04:32:12.750 --> 04:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education shall and
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
then if the committee says we need to
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
have input from students or we need
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
input from teachers in the field as
 
04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
needed in other words it may not be
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
clearly then they're going to have to do
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
it because it's a need of the task
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
force yes I understand and and clearly
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
all this is driven by the due date of
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2026 if it was if it was June
 
04:32:37.439 --> 04:32:39.349 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2026 if it was if it was June
30th

04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
30th
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
2075 uh as needed could be work can
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
expand to fill the time allotted so
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
everything is driven by June 30th 2026
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
the second question is can my limited
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
life experience in non-governmental
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
entities task forces were dismissed at
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
when they completed their task is there
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
any dismissal to this task force once it
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
completes its task or is this a task
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
force that is in business in perpetuity
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
the initial part of of developing this
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
program yes and then continuing yes
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
to to because the reports they they will
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
be looking at and saying how do it go
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
after the first year the second year the
 
04:33:21.230 --> 04:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
third year are there any issues that we
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
have to move forward either with
 
04:33:25.709 --> 04:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
legislation or with recommending or
 
04:33:27.869 --> 04:33:27.879 align:start position:0%
finding so we find is that correct
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
Nate yeah come on up to the mic so he he
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
Nate is out of the doe and this is his
 
04:33:38.109 --> 04:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
baileywick so to my question with
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
respect to there is no termination date
 
04:33:43.230 --> 04:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
for the task force they will continue
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
until whenever yes there's two different
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
pieces to this so the first part is
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
making recommendations for what the pbas
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
needs to look like yes the second piece
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
there's additional statutes that aren't
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
actually part of this amendment that are
 
04:33:57.629 --> 04:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
just current statutes that require the
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
department to make um recommendations
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
for legislation relative to PBS so we
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
would want some form of this task force
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
to continue on to evaluate how what they
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
create in this version is uh impacting
 
04:34:14.109 --> 04:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
schools Community School leaders um one
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we would expect from
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
this task force is a recommendation in
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
statute of how that task force would
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
then continue on would there be term
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
limits for different members would be a
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
different size of a task force maybe you
 
04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
need a smaller version of this initial
 
04:34:28.349 --> 04:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
one so I would expect that to come as
 
04:34:29.949 --> 04:34:29.959 align:start position:0%
part of The Proposal from this task
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
force as to how does the uh new
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
iterations of the task force continue on
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
after their work here is done okay so I
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
understand that this task force is not
 
04:34:42.910 --> 04:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh the final task force that is
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
envisioned therefore all of these people
 
04:34:48.590 --> 04:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
that are going to be uh appointed uh the
 
04:34:52.349 --> 04:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
10 people would understand when they
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
when they get involved that they're not
 
04:34:56.349 --> 04:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
signing up for something for the rest of
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
their lives yes because there will be
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
another body that will be created as one
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes of of this task force
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
work yes okay and ideally there would be
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
some overlap you'd have some members
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
from this initial task force that would
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
continue on but then with the Poss ility
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
of you know as people step away from the
 
04:35:15.869 --> 04:35:15.879 align:start position:0%
task force um you have new people come
 
04:35:19.230 --> 04:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
on board yes thank
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
you anything else yes represent dry
 
04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you just continuing on with
 
04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
that we have pretty specific membership
 
04:35:30.429 --> 04:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for the task force and if
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
there's an iteration of that if that
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
changes does the statute have to change
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
it would yes
 
04:35:37.561 --> 04:35:39.269 align:start position:0%
it would yes
okay

04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:41.949 --> 04:35:41.959 align:start position:0%
represent so thanks and and thank you Dr
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
Green um so um one of the one of
 
04:35:48.269 --> 04:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
the parts of the existing statute that
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
this um overs is the every four
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
years part so uh so the the the statute
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
and the the the amendment basically says
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
the task force delivers a product no
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
later than June 30th
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
2026 do we should we have anything that
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
provides that that I mean the task force
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
continues but there's no sort of like
 
04:36:10.879 --> 04:36:12.789 align:start position:0%
continues but there's no sort of like
deliverable

04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
deliverable
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
schedule so I think that would be a
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation that would come from the
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
task force um I would argue four years
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
is probably not the right term um for
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
new deliverables to come out we make new
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
school designations every three years so
 
04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
it may be that every three years when we
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
run the accountability system we look to
 
04:36:30.750 --> 04:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
see did it perform the way it was
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to is it matching up with the
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
expectations and intentions of Statute
 
04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
and Rule and at that point the
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
department would be looking to make
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
future recommendations for legislation
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that would most likely be role of a
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
future task force is on that threeyear
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
schedule every time we run the system
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
we' be looking to see is the system
 
04:36:50.910 --> 04:36:50.920 align:start position:0%

04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
currently for New Hampshire schools
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
great great thank thanks very much a I'm
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
seeing that on page two sort of lines 9
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
1011 um continuous
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
review is is that sort of where you
 
04:37:04.109 --> 04:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
where you said so we don't so we don't
 
04:37:07.390 --> 04:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
lose that idea yeah yeah all right great
 
04:37:07.400 --> 04:37:09.189 align:start position:0%
lose that idea yeah yeah all right great
thank

04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
you any other questions on on the
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.039 --> 04:37:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:37:20.750 --> 04:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you and thank you Nate
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
because I think this looks exactly like
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
we talked about in um in the subte in
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and but much more
 
04:37:34.189 --> 04:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
understandable than what we talked about
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
this and there were some loose ends that
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh Benjamin over an OS Bound in in the
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
called and talked to Caitlyn and Nate
 
04:37:45.310 --> 04:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
and and they've been Incorporated in
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.719 --> 04:37:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
hopefully

04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this is the first time
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
that I've seen a bill reference actual
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
account numbers I'm looking at line 22
 
04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
two so can you just give us a little
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
perspective on that like what those
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
accounts are and why are we that
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
specific so those accounts come from the
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
state budget um those two particular
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
accounts are the ones that fund the
 
04:38:22.349 --> 04:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
assessment accountability work that my
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
office does um the first one is an
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund account it's line
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh 612 at the end of that accounting
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
string 612 is uh specifically an
 
04:38:32.590 --> 04:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
accounting line for State assessment
 
04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
purposes and it's what we use to pay our
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
state assessment contracts and the
 
04:38:37.869 --> 04:38:37.879 align:start position:0%
assessment work which is where a lot of
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
the accountability data comes from and
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
then the second accounting line there is
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
7 64 um which is a general fund account
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
that also funds the assessment and
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
accountability work of my
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
office we we have some funds like the
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we wanted it non-lps
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing we're also looking at building Aid
 
04:39:11.551 --> 04:39:11.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of being used for the
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
task force in the public school
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we used to have
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
contractors which got on the job late in
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
that uh uh session and the money did not
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
roll over it and so we ended up losing
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that money because it was during covid
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
and you couldn't find
 
04:39:35.310 --> 04:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
contractors and so we changed that say
 
04:39:38.110 --> 04:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's non-aps it stays in that fund and
 
04:39:40.990 --> 04:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
we can continue to use it so that was
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
the thing right here too that we
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
continue to have that money available
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.110 --> 04:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
force so any other questions for Nate on
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
this one Dr
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
Green Dr Green that sounds good I know I
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't have quite the same audiences this
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
morning but I'm happy to take you know
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
three hours four hours of questions if
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
you guys want to stick around
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we've been there and done
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
me um well well we we have not had a
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
caucus on this at all and is there
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
anybody feels they need a caucus in this
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
one or we just want to roll on some of
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:40:34.628 --> 04:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
stuff on on 378 on 378
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
378 you want to do a straw in case you
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
think do we really think we need to
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
recall Mary on this no no I don't think
 
04:40:41.040 --> 04:40:42.670 align:start position:0%
recall Mary on this no no I don't think
so

04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
I think so this is um so what I'll do is
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%

05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you see the you're you're going to
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
be writing the
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
OTP with it not amend
 
05:14:12.548 --> 05:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to be taking it
 
05:14:12.558 --> 05:14:20.670 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to be taking it
off

05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
okays right
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay so after a consultation with
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
uh an expert far greater than me um I
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
will change my vote back to uh ought to
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
pass yes there you go

there's one committee report right right
 
05:15:09.150 --> 05:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
and the committee report won't won't
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with the um the
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that just
 
05:15:12.480 --> 05:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
amendment that just
failed

05:15:14.230 --> 05:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
failed
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
no it'll just be on the merits of the
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself yes thank
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah looks like floor me okay so
 
05:15:25.708 --> 05:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
where we are right
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
now the OTP motion will move forward
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
there will be a blur put together
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee report by represent
 
05:15:37.390 --> 05:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli and it's not going to go on or
 
05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
you can calendar on the
 
05:15:42.350 --> 05:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
calendar it's not on consent right it's
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to be on the regular calendar on
 
05:15:45.150 --> 05:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar we've had that was
 
05:15:49.868 --> 05:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
20 nothing okay yeah yes yeah we can do
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
that yeah so go ahead represent luno
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so thanks so I so I think just for
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
um full transparency here where where
 
05:16:05.510 --> 05:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
what do you see happening um not in
 
05:16:08.110 --> 05:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
terms of what what what do you see
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
happening then on on the floor when this
 
05:16:11.788 --> 05:16:11.798 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
05:16:14.310 --> 05:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
floor I mean this is not on consent it's
 
05:16:16.670 --> 05:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar for a
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
reason probably because there'll be an
 
05:16:20.110 --> 05:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that'll be offered onor
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be a floor Amendment something
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'll consider yeah yeah okay okay
 
05:16:24.240 --> 05:16:26.868 align:start position:0%
I'll consider yeah yeah okay okay
yeah

05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:16:30.510 --> 05:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
y okay so we're done our business with
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
our two bills we had to exact today we
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
do have uh before you right here looking
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the clock I don't want to spend a lot
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
of time on this either
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
we usually do it right in the general
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
court room there we have five bills
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
which will be that are Senate messages
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
that came to us from the
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
Senate and we'll work all the way up
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the bottom number which is
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
1107 the
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation this is the Frameworks
 
05:17:01.310 --> 05:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill that we worked hard on and it's one
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
where I'd suggest that we
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
consent they've added the every 10 years
 
05:17:09.390 --> 05:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
up top there
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh that the education department to
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
Institute procedures for maintaining
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
upgrading updating and improving
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
refining the minimum standards Public
 
05:17:18.750 --> 05:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
School approval and the curriculum
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
framework so every 10 years that's not a
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
bad addition seeing we're working off
 
05:17:24.910 --> 05:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
with some of
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
our our
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
um like Health it was what 2006 it was
 
05:17:34.270 --> 05:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
written and social studies a little
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
later than that but you know these these
 
05:17:39.230 --> 05:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh minimum standards are getting pretty
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
old and so we should be doing it every
 
05:17:41.040 --> 05:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
old and so we should be doing it every
10

05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
10
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
years anybody oppos to consent okay
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's consent concur concur concur yes
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.670 --> 05:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
1165 okay this is the one where
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
here we had the monies for the public
 
05:18:12.878 --> 05:18:14.190 align:start position:0%
here we had the monies for the public
school

05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure have been appropriated
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
through hb1 and
 
05:18:19.120 --> 05:18:20.788 align:start position:0%
through hb1 and
two

05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:18:23.708 --> 05:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
and there this year this bu and we
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
appropriated 10 million dollar Public
 
05:18:27.150 --> 05:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
School infrastructure that's the access
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
to safety and all egress and all that of
 
05:18:29.440 --> 05:18:30.750 align:start position:0%
to safety and all egress and all that of
school

05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
houses the public school infrastructure
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
commission looks at that makes
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations based upon the
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
applications we receive but then we have
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
to take that to fiscal and then back to
 
05:18:42.400 --> 05:18:44.030 align:start position:0%
to take that to fiscal and then back to
Governor

05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
Council it seemed kind of ridiculous to
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
us that we had to take it the fiscal
 
05:18:50.670 --> 05:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
when it's already been appropriated by
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
way of
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
hb1 and what it often times did it
 
05:18:59.310 --> 05:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
delayed the using this money in a exp
 
05:19:01.548 --> 05:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
expedited fashion especially during the
 
05:19:02.830 --> 05:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
summer when we're trying to get all the
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
work done so but they' changed it where
 
05:19:09.628 --> 05:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
it's got to go back to fiscal
 
05:19:11.310 --> 05:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
I guess they don't trust that commission
 
05:19:13.868 --> 05:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
or the department
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't it
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
know yeah it it's it's probably what we
 
05:19:30.070 --> 05:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.190 --> 05:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
date that's the only
 
05:19:34.548 --> 05:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
change kind of a Mickey Mouse change
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't you
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
think um same yeah that's right just got
 
05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
to do something to everything 1305 is
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
the freedom of speech and Association uh
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
at public institutions higher education
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
we got this side by side on page one
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
when they're talking about um Campus
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
Community defining that you can see
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
where it says include students
 
05:20:01.390 --> 05:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
administrators faculty and staff at the
 
05:20:03.310 --> 05:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
institution of higher education and
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
their invited guests the Senate took out
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have a gutach over
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
that uh on page
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
four the next next change is what
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
constitutes harassment and it's defined
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
as RSA 188
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
j16 they put or other applicable state
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
of federal law or
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
regulation and just above that too and
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's one above that too yeah and see
 
05:20:39.868 --> 05:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
the Senate ver version
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.080 --> 05:20:49.548 align:start position:0%
 
activity

05:20:49.548 --> 05:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
activity
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
um I've talked to the sponsor of the
 
05:20:55.548 --> 05:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
bill he's just anxious for this thing to
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
move forward he thinks this is a a a
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
positive thing I'm I'm support of of
 
05:21:00.320 --> 05:21:01.948 align:start position:0%
positive thing I'm I'm support of of
concurrent

05:21:01.948 --> 05:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
else okay all you need is a majority
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
quum we got to concur on that um next
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
one I thought there
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
was what's the next number you have 1665
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
no I got5 1695 wait a minute it say
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
separate paper oh there it is underneath
 
05:21:29.350 --> 05:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
1665 55
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%

it's one
word

05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.868 --> 05:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:00.868 --> 05:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
concur any really violent objections
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:15.150 --> 05:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
they changed the one
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
right within 14
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
before I don't know just put a little
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
preposition in front of it huh I'll take
 
05:22:41.548 --> 05:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
it outes sound better don't know why no
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
it's there's no there's a definite one
 
05:22:46.910 --> 05:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
has to be during within those 14 days
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
when it has to be before those 14 days
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah can do we know why why it
 
05:22:58.950 --> 05:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:58.960 --> 05:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I I I I think that doing it before the
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
14 days provides more
 
05:23:14.590 --> 05:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
time but within
 
05:23:17.548 --> 05:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
St to a third part shall be informed
 
05:23:22.670 --> 05:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
date so we want somebody releasing the
 
05:23:27.948 --> 05:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
student assessment materials like a
 
05:23:27.958 --> 05:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
student assessment materials like a
third

05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.400 --> 05:23:32.868 align:start position:0%
 
party

05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
um we'd notify them ahead of time
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:41.788 --> 05:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so you do it at the beginning
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:58.030 --> 05:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
on oh that
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:22.350 --> 05:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
person just that before you release the
 
05:24:24.070 --> 05:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
data you have to notify the
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
parent um there is no beginning of the
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
school year um yeah there's
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
no the parent has no since it's federal
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:44.190 --> 05:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
um so this is basically just a
 
05:24:44.200 --> 05:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
um so this is basically just a
notification

05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.070 --> 05:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
system no there's no there's no
 
05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
opting in out because it's under covered
 
05:25:02.000 --> 05:25:04.788 align:start position:0%
opting in out because it's under covered
under

05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
purp can you clarify that is this
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
because um your you're speaking about
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
the provisions in fpo where they're
 
05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to share the
 
05:25:17.830 --> 05:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
data but exceptions under perp
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes but it also applies to all third
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
party vendors
 
05:25:22.440 --> 05:25:25.470 align:start position:0%
party vendors
still

05:25:25.470 --> 05:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
notification right right now there's
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
no yes representative cordelli I'm just
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
thinking when you testified
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
the last go around when you said that
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
the big deal was that it would happen
 
05:25:46.110 --> 05:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
but they would at least know that it
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
happened within for you know after it
 
05:25:51.070 --> 05:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
all yes now this is changed to the
 
05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
before to be before so it's a totally
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
different time frame it's a different
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes I actually like the Senate's
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
change you're doing it before you're
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.708 --> 05:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
to say I don't want my my child's
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:19.868 --> 05:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
party I thought the parent didn't have
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
well it could be any could thought
 
05:26:25.948 --> 05:26:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
say this is just a notification it's not
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:44.430 --> 05:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.910 --> 05:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
student personally
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
identify wish I do you have the laot
 
05:26:54.430 --> 05:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.070 --> 05:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
second more
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
stringent I I wouldn't I wouldn't say
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
stringent it's just an add an additional
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that you have to notify
 
05:27:03.760 --> 05:27:08.390 align:start position:0%
requirement that you have to notify
parents

05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.948 --> 05:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
the will still release the information
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
third part yes but
 
05:27:16.510 --> 05:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
notification based on the sentence
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
version notification for parents will be
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
at least 14 um at least 14 days prior
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
be shall be 14 school days before so so
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that specifically
 
05:28:09.990 --> 05:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
on 14 days before the release not 15
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
exactly it says under the furpa here on
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
page 503 of your law
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
books the right to inspect and review
 
05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
the students education records within 14
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
days after the day the School receives a
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.110 --> 05:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
that's a little different than this part
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
though doesn't make you can't do what
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
they're saying they want you to do they
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
want you to release they want you to
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
inform the parent 14 days before the Rel
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
so you know your tenses don't match up
 
05:29:28.270 --> 05:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
14 days before releas to whom the data
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
would be released will
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
be ask J if they would in the enrollment
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
process would they change the tense if
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
the tense is wrong sure go ahead uh
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me um Jen expert 4 um would in
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the enrollment process if they found the
 
05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
tense was wrong it shall be you know was
 
05:29:51.680 --> 05:29:52.430 align:start position:0%
tense was wrong it shall be you know was
for

05:29:52.430 --> 05:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
instance uh would that be corrected in
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
right right like a comma or something
 
05:30:15.680 --> 05:30:19.430 align:start position:0%
right right like a comma or something
yeah

05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.070 --> 05:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
right yeah that would change it
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know it's not worth it is
 
05:30:31.360 --> 05:30:40.550 align:start position:0%
that I don't know it's not worth it is
it

05:30:40.550 --> 05:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:40.560 --> 05:30:44.548 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
see we have to have these done see we
 
05:30:48.750 --> 05:30:48.760 align:start position:0%

right so so that's the time so we have
 
05:31:02.990 --> 05:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
to you know have this thing done prior
 
05:31:07.150 --> 05:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
to the mon can we can we can we ask for
 
05:31:09.190 --> 05:31:09.200 align:start position:0%

language at the committee of conference
 
05:31:17.310 --> 05:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.320 --> 05:31:26.910 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:31:26.910 --> 05:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
request that's probably the way to do it
 
05:31:28.958 --> 05:31:30.110 align:start position:0%
request that's probably the way to do it
right

05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
now okay everybody good with just going
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
non-c concur request committee

concur okay we have one week to get what
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh wayss and means is but other than
 
05:31:42.270 --> 05:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
that we look
 
05:31:46.030 --> 05:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
good and they have input on one of those
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
we want to concur I think we'll convince
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
thing yes can I just ask a question so
 
05:31:55.190 --> 05:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
if this goes to Committee of conference
 
05:31:57.390 --> 05:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
which one they have to decide which
 
05:31:59.310 --> 05:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
one's better the within just let's talk
 
05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
language has representatives from the
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate right yes four and
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
three we'll have four and only those
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
that are on the committee of conference
 
05:32:17.230 --> 05:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill so we'd have I'd have to go back
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
and look
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
at then it comes back to the house but
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
they have a choice when they go to
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference they have a
 
05:32:29.708 --> 05:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
choice whether to decide the philosophy
 
05:32:32.670 --> 05:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
of within 14 days rather than 14 days
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
before they have that choice between
 
05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah everybody has to sign off
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
or else it fails or no okay we've had to
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
remove people on the committee of
 
05:32:48.310 --> 05:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
conference before I've done that and
 
05:32:49.628 --> 05:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
then you get the votes the way you want
 
05:32:51.788 --> 05:32:51.798 align:start position:0%
it but then you get to the house floor
 
05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's another deal
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
yeah other than that I think we're done
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
