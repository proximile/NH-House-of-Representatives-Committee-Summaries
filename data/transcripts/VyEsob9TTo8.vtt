00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
question from the fiscal item that we
 
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
passed last month and um I had spoken
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
with you about it last night um what
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal passed back in um
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
March um the qualifiers in there were um
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
um principally shall be principally
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire the events for
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
releas relief is sought to must have
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
occurred through New Hampshire borders
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
have been in operation since at least
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2022 and experien a loss
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
of gross receipts from 22 to 23 now when
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
the program came out um there is an
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
additional eligibility criteria which
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
you added to that was 50% of Nest net
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
Farm loss can you explain why you
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
changed that
 
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
criteria so to be clear we did not
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
change the
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
criteria so even and I'll be glad to sit
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
down with anyone to explain this but all
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
along even in Senator ennis's Bill um
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that this really morphed into there was
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
criteria because Farms lose money all
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
the time in my own business as a
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
landlord my net receipts go up and down
 
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
depending on how many tenants I have in
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
a building
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure that in order
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
to award money it wasn't just that
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
people had a had these had lost money it
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
was you had to have your receipts down
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
you had to have all these things these
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
are the things that get you in the
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
door I believe that you New Hampshire
 
00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
has always been clear we don't pay money
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
to people who still had a
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
profit and if you go through any of the
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
testimony even on the bill it was about
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
Devastation it was about people were
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
really hurt well if you're still making
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
money then obviously you are not in a
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
situation where you're going to close
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
your your doors
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
so the bill and and what we always
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
intended to do was pay to people who
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
lost and this document is on our web
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
website it was posted March 1st and in
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
it it's very clear starting March 1st
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
eligible Farmers eligible Farmers that's
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
criteria can apply for rewards intended
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
to account for 50% of net Farm loss so
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
in in my
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
mind everything we've done right from
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
the beginning was to help farmers who
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
lost money in their operations what I'm
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
now hearing from people is well it
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
simply if you had a decrease in your
 
00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.430 align:start position:0%
simply if you had a decrease in your
net

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
income regardless of whether you were
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
profitable or not we're going to give
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
you money I that's foreign to me and so
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's why I never even gave
 
00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 align:start position:0%
that a consideration that we were going
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
to be paying people just based on a
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in income now there have been
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions about what if somebody sent
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
sold off assets to be able to stay in
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
business there's a box 19 on the form
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
for an explanation if somebody was in
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
doing something that was outside of the
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
normal operations we will look at that
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly if somebody says I had to
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
sell equipment because otherwise I was
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
going to lose the farm we will take that
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
into consideration and make an award
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
based on those conditions and that's to
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
everybody we've said put in box 19 the
 
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
things outside of the norm so we can
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
consider that because I understand that
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
it's more than just profit and loss you
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
know I've been in in business my whole
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
life and I understand these things
 
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.670 align:start position:0%
life and I understand these things
things

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
so followup follow up so I may not dis I
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
may not disagree with you however I
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
still feel that you changed the criteria
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
from to a 50% net loss versus gross
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
profits could you have not at least
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
defined gross profits as that so they
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
they would know because when we put um
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
put this
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
through um I know that when it was
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
testified the state based their 16
 
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
million of loss um loss crops and we
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
based that 16 million we cut that in
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
half to give the um Farmers 8 million
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
based on crops
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
lost and this doesn't
 
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.030 align:start position:0%
lost and this doesn't
match

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
so and I respect that this is not the
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill um this is a you know different
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
program but I guess again in my
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
mind if you're going to
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
lose you know your crops it's going to
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
result in a net loss and so yes I think
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
that there is some reasonable confusion
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
with this but this is not an entitlement
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
program either this is a program
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
designed to help people who are in a
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
devastating situation and I think for
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
most Farms um if they lost lost that
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
much of the crop it's going to result in
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
a pretty substantial net loss and and
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
frankly in New Hampshire we expect
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
people to Pivot and so if they were able
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
to recover some of that income through
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
other things that's that's great and
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
they did all right but many of them
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
would still have a net loss um so I I'm
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what we can do now to
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
to change our message I have to tell you
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I have not had one single
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
call other than from the governor about
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
this and he called me because people are
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
calling him people are calling you what
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
nobody is doing is calling me that is
 
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.509 align:start position:0%
nobody is doing is calling me that is
very

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
troubling that we're not getting those
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
calls directly I had one email that went
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
to director Marshall he forwarded it to
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
me I responded and that farmer did not
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
respond to me but I've heard that he's
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
been complaining to others about my
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
response without responding in to me so
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
there have been very few things that
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
have frustrated me um in my time in
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
conquered more than this because of the
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
lack of communications did you pay out
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
any money under this program we had two
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
we tried uh three was it two or three we
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
tried to get on as aate agenda for this
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um but we have have not uh we
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through GNC with those
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
yet most so you saw very few
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
applications early on as we expected
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
because this is tax season and for the
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
large op operations it's going to take
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
them quite a bit of time to get their
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
numbers together to work with their
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
accountant some of them will not have
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
their federal income taxes done I mean
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
some businesses like my business uh my
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
family business we actually don't close
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
out till March 31st but you can get an
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
ass assess yeah you can you can get a
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
document from your accountant attesting
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
to the fact that um this this is the uh
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
the facts so we're we're making
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
allowances for all of those things
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
further question Senator bdel and I
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you're saying
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner however if you look at the
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
eligible the
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility um you say it's not the
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the bill but you
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
use the identical eligibility in the
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill as in your
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
qualifiers in in Senator if you look on
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
our eligibility page we are using all
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
the same eligibility but I would I would
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
call to your attention if we want to try
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
to compare apples to oranges which I
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
think it is looking at the crop loss the
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
the bill that Senator Enis sponsored if
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
you go down on uh page two I believe it
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
is there's all the eligibility and then
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
it then under the awards under the
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
emergency crop relief operation shall
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
have the following requirement no entity
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
shall receive more than 50% of gross
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
losses and it doesn't that doesn't match
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
the language that is in the criteria
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
which is a reduction in income we now
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
move into here's what gets you in the
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
door you have to have a reduction of
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
income and then you have to have a loss
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
one's an eligibility the other is the
 
00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.710 align:start position:0%
one's an eligibility the other is the
actual

00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
criteria on which the award is based and
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
we were consistent with that although we
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
don't have we're going on the Assumption
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
of 50% we don't have that restriction in
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
the actual program um we may revisit
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
that later depending on the awards we
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
have no idea you know what the numbers
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be um and so you know I I'm
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
proud of the program we put up out I am
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
sorry that there is confusion but in you
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
know in my
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
mind um we never just pay out money
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
because somebody had a reduction in in
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
income we pay out we help people when
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
they have experienced a loss to their
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
their total operation and and that's
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
where the confusion arose um I've gone
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
through all the testimony and there's
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
nothing specific to people thinking they
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
were going to get money based on a
 
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.790 align:start position:0%
were going to get money based on a
simply

00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
um a loss of Revenue nor is there
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
anything specific to saying they thought
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
they were going to it was based on a
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
bottom line loss so yeah there's
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
confusion back and and forth but again
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
this is this is not a guarantee none of
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is a guarantee and the fiscal note
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
that came before you said that um I can
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
read the language exactly that the
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
food will establish guidance and
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
application process based on the
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
following criteria for applicants with
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
approval by the governor and Council and
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
our whole application process did go
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
through that process was approved and
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
and that's what we came up with so I'm
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we tried to move this as
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
quickly as we could because look at the
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
weather I think I heard peepers last
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
night um people are going to be looking
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
to get um crop in the ground they're
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
going to be needing that I know people
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
have got h2a workers coming in very soon
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
our whole idea uh was is to get the
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
money out to those who are in desperate
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
need of cash not just gee wouldn't it be
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
nice to give people money because they
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
experienced a decrease in their revenue
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
I guess page one criteria should have
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
been a bit
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
more explicit so they didn't oh good I'm
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to get the money and then go on
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
and not pay as much attention as they
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
build out the rest of it so Mr chairman
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
as always hindsight is 2020 U but I'm
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
glad to sit down with any member of the
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
legislature go over this um but this to
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
for us to do anything other than what we
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
put in the process would put a stop to
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
this whole program and have to go um
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
back through the process again uh and
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
frankly you know as I I said to the
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
governor how many people have actually
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
called I know nobody's called me so are
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
we talking about a very vocal minority I
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
think perhaps we are and I guess the
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
good news is the catastrophic losses
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
weren't as catastrophe as we thought if
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
nobody's really lost the farm over this
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
well I think there are a couple that are
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
probably are on the edge um but they
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
haven't got their applications in
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
because in some cases they've got to go
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
back to the previous owners they've got
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of work with their
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
accountants to get to us I mean we're
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
only open this is only the second week
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
open so thank you we're doing the best
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
best we can and right now uh it's very
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
frustrating Senator bdel thank you Mr
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
chair and I understand you say you
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from the um anyone except
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
for that one email but I know that um
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
someone from your office was in the
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
meeting when the program was announced
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
and an individual did get up and speak
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
about how he was re bured only
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
$4,900 or authorized $4,900 when in
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
reality his total loss was $15 but I
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
still go back to the fact
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we authorized gross
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
profits versus changing it to net
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
profits and if you wanted to make it net
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
then maybe there should have been in the
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
program a definition of what gross
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
profits were because that's what this
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee passed and I feel I
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
feel like it was changed without even
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
Consulting anyone on the fiscal
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee and the the farmers yes
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
they're up in an uproar about this
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
however they were under a different
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
understanding and we needed to get that
 
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.630 align:start position:0%
understanding and we needed to get that
word

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
out I I appreciate that Senator to begin
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
in in what you actually passed it only
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
talks about the CR
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
criteria and and it and the only thing
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility experienced a loss of gross
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
receipts as as the foot in the door the
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
rest was left up to us to to develop
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with the language in
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
the bill which did not pass and which
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
you know we were not wetted to because
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
it was not a bill that passed this was
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
the replacement of it but trying to be
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
respectful of what was done we tried to
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
mirror that in working with all all
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
party I again I mean I would be
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely opposed to paying money to
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
Farms that were profitable in the case
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
of the farm that you um referenced
 
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
looking at those those numbers that
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
person yes has has had
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily good returns over the
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
years I somewhat shocked by what a high
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
percentage his return is
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
um but he's had very good years for for
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
a long time and had a small loss this
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
year we gave him allowances he had a um
 
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.149 align:start position:0%
year we gave him allowances he had a um
higher

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
depreciation um than normal this year so
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
we averaged that that was part of that
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
and gave a 15% increase to that we gave
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
a credit towards up to
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
5% um of his grosser receipts towards
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
Labor uh and yeah it still didn't amount
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
to to much but this is not this is not a
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
farm that is on on the brink um you know
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
and you are certainly welcome to say we
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
just want to give out money to people
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
even if they're making a profit if
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
that's the message from the legislature
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's your
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
prerogative that's not what I ever
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
understood any of this to be um so While
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
others may be confused and misunder I
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
certainly misunderstood if the intent
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
was just hey you get a a drop in your
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
income we're going to make up half of
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
the difference that's foreign to
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
me further one final point in the
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
explanation on the um item it says um
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
Department of agricultureal markets and
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
food will establish guidance and Grant
 
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
application process it doesn't say
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
change the process or change the
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
guidance and in regards to that IND
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
individual um he lost all of his Apple
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
crops and had to go out and purchase for
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
$225,000 additional Apples because he
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
had no apples so he did
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
have so some expenses that I don't think
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
were taken into consideration well those
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
expenses if he did not put those on his
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
schedule F that's not my my fault that
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
was a legitimate expense and I've talked
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
to many people who have um had the same
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
experience they went out purchased
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
apples made a small Pro process on that
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
up profit on those
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
apples but nonetheless it contributed to
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
the overall farm income you certainly if
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee believes that I
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
misled them in in this note then you
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
know we'll have to stop the pro the
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
program and start over again um if
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
because it was not our intent to mislead
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
you it was our intent
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
to um to give you the criteria and say
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
would go forward with a program but I
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to sit down with anybody if
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
there are any further questions but
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately you
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
know this program is based on your
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
approval and I respect the fact that if
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
you believe I misled you then we need to
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
that representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh Mr commissioner uh as
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm listening to this it I'm thinking in
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
background um what sort of affirmative
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
efforts is the department making to get
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
the word out to potentially uh needy
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
farmers are we are we taking an
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
affirmative stance towards pushing the
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
information we are through all of the
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
the organizations out there um NOA New
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm Bureau buau certainly the
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
work weekly Market Bulletin um the Press
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
has covered this I I doubt that there is
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
any Farm of any significant size in the
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
state um who isn't aware of it we've
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
been to the just last week to the two
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
major commodity groups the fruit and
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
vegetable Growers the um tree fruit um
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Berry and vegetables so those commodity
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
groups are well aware it they're pushing
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
it out there we have been communicating
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
um to the best of our ability and I
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
really don't think that there's uh there
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
are too many people hiding under a rock
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
at this point who are not aware of this
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you for the answer
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
you Senator
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
agree uh thank you
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
um when you characterize just giving
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
them money in in your statement
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
um I would have rather seen you
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
characterize that as we want to keep
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
people in the farming business you know
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
the small guy you know and and the big
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
guy uh and that you know looking at the
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
losses um you know like if the program
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
said uh if you received 10% of your
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
income from a farming effort in before
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that 10% was cut to nothing uh
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's different than looking at it uh
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
but certainly we don't want to be
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
perceived as you know giving money to
 
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
those who don't need it like we were
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
several times during the covid money uh
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
would you like to comment on on those
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
well sometimes
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
my my uh thoughts are not as uh as
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
politically correct perhaps as as they
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
should be and I and I verbalize them and
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's probably not to the benefit of
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
anyone but you know I you have the
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
benefit of hearing what what I'm
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
thinking whether that's uh the best
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
thing or not but I in anything we've put
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
out there we have always talked about
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we want to help those who
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
need are in need 30,000 is a pretty low
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
number um because we were looking at
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
who's you know if if you're looking at
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
30,000 and you're looking at an average
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
business you know a 10% profit margin is
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
pretty good so we said all right that
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
would net somebody
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
$3,000 probably not life or death and at
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
what point we've done this really
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
without taking money for the Department
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
if you open this up to literally then
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of people at a small amount
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be taking money away from
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
those who truly need it we spent an hour
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
on the on a zoom call yesterday with NOA
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire talking about that very
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
issue about those who who have
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
application have Farms of under
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
30,000 um they're important all of those
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
Farms are very important to New
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but in terms of a
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
disaster they're not likely to be put
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
under out of business but what I did
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
offer to them was say all right ask a
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
few Farms to put in those applications
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
even though they know they're not going
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
to be eligible at this point we'll look
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
at that we'll consider that and see if
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
we don't get to the full 8 million
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
should we then
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
come back and say all right let's let's
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
change that criteria we did that a few
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
years ago with the covid funds the and
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
because again we want to make sure that
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
we get as much money to those who are
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
making a living at it as possible when
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's money left over if the
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
government the powers that be feel that
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to to spread that out
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
to some others who who got hurt but
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going out of business I'm
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to do this but you know
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's got to be narrow to start
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
with because it's pretty much josing
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
myself in one person from Cooperative
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
Extension who has been authorized to
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
assist with us it's not his full-time
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
job to do this if you open that up
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
immediately to everybody who had any
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
income from farming uh would' be
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
December before we got money out the
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
door um so everybody wants wants more
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I get that but we just we
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
can't make everybody happy I said to
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
Josh when we opened this program up I
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
said you watch no good deed goes
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
unpunished I'm going to have more people
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
mad at me that are going to be happy
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
with he said Oh no you're not and I said
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
oh yes I am and here we are
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
today Senator rosenal Mr chairman
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner following up on your
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
comment about if we don't spend and the
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
whole 8 million will have to go back
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on the deadline in a few
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
months for encumbering these funds my
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the $8 million was
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
arrived at by saying that was 50% of
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
crop losses so by narrowing the
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
criteria it seems like you're probably
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
not going to get the whole 8 million out
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
the door to Farms that have lost money
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that we leave this
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
money unspent when our intent at least
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
in the Senate was to go through fiscal
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
as a way to be quicker than going
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process I I
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
still believe that to be true and
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell is is sitting
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
behind me um and I believe that we
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
really have till the end of this
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
calendar year so if we get to May 15th
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
we can pivot again very quickly if that
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
is the wish uh of everyone involved
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
whereas a bill in all likelihood we
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have even started that process
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
until um late June early July so I
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
believe there is plenty of time we can
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
move quickly and efficiently which we
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
have have done here you know it's
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
obviously um ruffled some some feathers
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
along the way and you know as always
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
could Communications have been better in
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
hindsight yes it just in my mind there
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
was never any question that this was
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
about a loss to the farming operation
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
that we were that's all we were looking
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
at in my mind and I apologize for that
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
and there was never communication from
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
anybody saying are you talking about
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
simply l of Revenue or are you talking
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
about loss um on the bottom
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
line that didn't happen and I and I
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
apologize Mr chair further questions can
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
we we'd like to
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%

2482 uh thank thank you um Mr chair and

um welcome uh Mr White I I I just have a
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
basic contract question here I I see
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
that DUIs and King have done all the
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
surveying have determined the issues
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
that need to be resolved so I'm just I'm
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
just curious from a Contracting
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
perspective you know a do we uh expect
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
them to want to bid on doing the work
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
and and and B if if they do compete on
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
this contract is there anything in the
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
selection criteria that would um
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
have us U consider more
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
strongly the folks that have not worked
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
on the survey I I'm I'm talking about
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantages here sure um
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%

the Department of Health and Human
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
Services the item before you um just for
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
everyone's uh context uh back during the
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget process of 2023 uh the
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
department had come forward with a
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
request to replace the Wastewater system
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
at Glen Cliff home um the total cost is
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
$1.8 million These funds are a grant
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
from the the Department of Environmental
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
Services to pay for the difference just
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of level Set uh relative to the
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process um the
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works under RSA 21i
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
is uh required to um put forward and
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for all bidding when
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
it comes to construction projects so I
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
can assume that there would be no
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
special provision or no special
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
Advantage because that'd be in violation
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
of RSA 21 uh
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
G37 uh which were and and 21i as well
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
which requires that objective criteria
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
be known to all parties so I would not
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
expect that there would be any advantage
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
given there um I don't know if um
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
where's uh commissioner Arling house I
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if you'd like him to comment
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
further thank you and as he's
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
approaching I i' just point out my
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
general thought here and that is
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the the the person doing the
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
survey tends to have a a competitive
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage because they know more about
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
the project and I I'm I'm I just want to
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we're maintaining a
 
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.349 align:start position:0%
make sure we're maintaining a
competitive

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
you're ready for the excuse me Mr
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I know you're not supposed to
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
ask questions when as a move the table
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
curious why there was any discussion
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
before a motion to table was
 
00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:31.190 align:start position:0%
before a motion to table was
offered

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
if uh Senator birdell will remove her
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
motion for a minute and certainly I will
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
speak to it
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
she's items motions withdrawn
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
temporarily um certainly there is uh uh
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
some things about the meat packing I've
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
been on several committees that have uh
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
Gone along with that uh it is a farm
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
related issue where they would be making
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
profits it's most closely Rel related to
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
the issue that we were discussing before
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh and we want to have further
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on that before we pass this
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
item and I will renew the motion to
 
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.790 align:start position:0%
item and I will renew the motion to
table

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
now okay back to the item to table it's
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%

and thanks again uh for considering my
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
question I I I just um I think this is
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
Well written but it just leaves me
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
curious uh We've appropriated um um
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
money for the forensic hospital and the
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital uh By Design had to
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a secure vestibule to
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
get in and now we're we're we're saying
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
that we need to upgrade um the New
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and I've seen it and
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
so I I I understand the need what I what
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand is if if is
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
how the money is working if we've
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
already appropriated money for the
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
forensic hospitals
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
vestule why you know why do we need
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
another 2.6 million this this seems to
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
me like a component of the forensic
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
project that could be morphed to help
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital and 2.6 is
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
just a lot of
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
money thank you for the question Ellen
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
Leo I'm the CEO at New Hampshire
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
hospital um great question so in regards
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
to excuse me the need to um consider
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
this funding um yes there was funding
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
allocated to the entry point of the
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital um during our security
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
assessments that have occurred in recent
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
months and in conjunction with the
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital planning it was noted
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
that um of course the entry point to the
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital is the same as the
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
entry point into the main hospital of
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital so there was work
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
and efforts in design into creating um
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
some distinct entry criteria and
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
equipment related to the forensic
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital specifically however with the
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
security design um feedback that was
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
received in post events that occurred at
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital safety related
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
recently it was decided that the that
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
renovation really needed to Encompass
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
the entirety of the entry into New
 
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and not just
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to the forensic component
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
of the build so this um is work that was
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
performed by our architect as well as
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
equipment that was uh recommended by
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
security expertise in order to not only
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
address the needs of the forensic
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital entry point but incorporate
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
that into the main entry point of the
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
facility in its
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
entirety well up so um I I I I'm not
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
trying to second guess the Architects
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just it just makes me curious now
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
are are are you going to need to be
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
building out in front of where New
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is now to get the
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
real estate to be able to have a joint
 
00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh vestibule or are you going to remain
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
within the confines of the New Hampshire
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital's entrance thank you for the
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
question it's the ladder so we're going
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
to remain within the confin of New
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's entrance and there
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
is some wiggle room associated with that
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
space currently as well as with the
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
plans with the forensic hospital already
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
addition of the forensic hospital
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
already so this work will be encompassed
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
within the current footprint of both the
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
current state of New Hampshire hospital
 
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
and the forensic Hospital
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
build I I think that's great you've
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
answered everything uh I I I just want
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
to let you know that since that visit
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
not me posting about it
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
I have gotten some really heated
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
comments about the lack of parking and
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
you told me that you know you're 50
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
short but uh so the that's not for today
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
I just want to leave that with you dly
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
noted thank you very
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
2492 Senator rosenal moves to adopt the
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
item Senator dallesandro seconds further
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none are you ready for
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
the question all in favor say I I oppose
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
no that item is adopted we'll move on to
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
item you might as well stay there item
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
94 0
 
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:41.559 align:start position:0%
24094 and representative Edwards is
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
question okay so these are potentially
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
hard questions um to answer in public
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
but but uh I I see on page
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
three there are five bullet items those
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
five and the state has been funding
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder initiatives for
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
years now uh these five bullets um sound
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
like they're the beginning of something
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we are way way way down stream from
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
beginning something and so um I I think
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
I understand that the farum center has
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
had an economic reset and this is needed
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
to reboot them but so then the hard
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
question gets to be really um do
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
we need them is it our job as the state
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
to go in and rescue uh failing entities
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
do we have enough existing capacity
 
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.069 align:start position:0%
do we have enough existing capacity
without

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
them I'm I'm just wondering if this is
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
the right invest M to intervene in the
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
marketplace I I'd like to know what you
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
think Miss
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
Fox good morning I'm ktia Fox I'm the
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Health these are all really good
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
questions and questions that we have
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves and I think that by embarking
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
on this um we're going to be able to
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
answer pretty quickly um about the need
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
I can tell you they have 77 beds 27 of
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
those are for detox and that is um a
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
very high amount um and at a level that
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
no um very few other providers um have
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
they also have um 40 residential beds
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
and 10 respit beds for that are
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
associated with the doorway farum Center
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
is a one of our Legacy organizations
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's a nonprofit it has served man
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
Chester and all of the state for many
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
many years in a very um effective way
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
and what's um really important is that
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
they serve everybody so they're serving
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
they you know they accept Medicaid they
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
serve the uninsured they serve the
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
underinsured um and private pay and so I
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
would say they're very much needed um
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have this opportunity
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
um examination by providing them the
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
breathing room to be able to transform
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
into a model that's sustainable uh from
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
a financial standpoint and meets the
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
needs of the
 
00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:43.549 align:start position:0%
needs of the
individuals

00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for that um I
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate your answer I I I'm I'm still
 
00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get at uh the the idea of um
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
if we let them fail uh is
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
there adequate capacity in the market uh
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
and I think the answer to that is no we
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
need the capacity it sounds pretty
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
significant so the so so the follow on
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
question to that is
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um if we let them fail is there another
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
white night entity that would come in
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
and uh take over the capacity that's got
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
a demonstrated track record of financial
 
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
a demonstrated track record of financial
success

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
ESS great questions um what is unique is
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
the people that farum serves and so yes
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
we could have a White Knight come in we
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
could have um capacity but not access
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
and so access for individuals who are um
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enroles who are uninsured is
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
farum

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
farum
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
so so thank you Mr chair I you know I
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really uncomfortable with this
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
proposal and uh I I may be the only one
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's this uncomfortable but I I would
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
like to move to table this
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
item first I'm going to accept a a
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
question from Senator rosemore thank you
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative um I had asked a question
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
about this item as well
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
um and the response we got back from the
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
Department was that it would be only
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
Bridge funding while Easter Seals looks
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
to De uh develop a sustainable
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
model what would that
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable model look like I mean would
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
it involve not taking people who are
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
uninsured uh limiting access to to
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enroll e how could farum become
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
financially sustainable because I don't
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
think we want to support them forever
 
00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:09.230 align:start position:0%
think we want to support them forever
and

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
ever so thank you Senator
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what that new model is
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
because this is a field that's emerging
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
and changing pretty rapidly and the
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
reason why we're here before you and why
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
farum and Easter Seals need the this
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
funding is to be able to model it out to
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
have that fiscal analysis to look at
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
programming to look at the needs that
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
they're serving today and how important
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
those are but what needs can they be
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
serving that are unmet and that um we
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
project into the future and so that's
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
where this assistance uh will come in
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime they need to keep
 
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
the doors
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
open you so are there models out there
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
for programs that do take all comers and
 
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.950 align:start position:0%
for programs that do take all comers and
are

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
financially sustainable or does the very
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
nature of them taking all comers mean
 
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
nature of them taking all comers mean
they

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
need extra support all the time so right
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
now farum has 78% of their um the people
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
that they serve are uh Medicaid enroles
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
so a change in payer mix does make a
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
difference um
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
the models are out there um I can't
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
point to one in particular but again
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is why this analysis is needed and
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
to really dig deep to find out um is
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
this the the where we go in the future
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
or do we change but what my number one
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh purpose is is to keep access for
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
those that we are most vulnerable and
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
need service and need to have access on
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
basis comment follow up on the
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
last year we got a breakdown of the
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
number the highest prescribed drugs for
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
various Insurance Pairs and for Medicaid
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
the highest number of prescribed drugs
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
were the
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment drugs so
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very high needs population just a
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
Indulgence representative
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
Edwards so thank you m again Mr chair
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
and and so there was mentioned by Miss
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
Fox that we want to continue to keep the
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
facility open so that Services could be
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
continued uh I I may be missing it but
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this proposal that
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
would help pay for the continuation of
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
services it it's all uh Strategic
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
Management planning and having once
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
written the Strategic plan it it feels
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
to me that we ought to be able to get
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
the same product for 10% of the request
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
here so I I I don't know that this is a
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
Justified amount really for the work
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
being requested so I apologize for that
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
not being being included in the letter
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the investment funding and looking at
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
new models and this is over a 18-month
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
period by the way not just one year um
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
is close to half a million and then the
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
bridge funding to uh maintain Services
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
is 1.7 million so that bulk of the
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
funding is to keep um the operations
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
going um and not have any disrupture in
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
the ongoing services so you're probably
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
being gentle with me saying that you
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
didn't put it in the write up but is it
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
really in the write up and I just
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
overlooked that breakdown I mean you can
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct me it's
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay if it's there it's there if it's
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
not it's not so it it we didn't include
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
the breakdown because typically we're
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
getting into the contractual elements
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
there which we submit to to GNC as as
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers that Kata quoted could
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
change through
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations um so generally speaking
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
the Department's pretty hesitant to put
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
very detailed specifics that are subject
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
to negotiation because they could change
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
and to bind us to the fiscal letter for
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
those very details could could prove
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
challenging if you look at the bottom of
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
page two what we tried to explain there
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
to to your point representative Edwards
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
was by requiring and supporting the
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
organization and it's that support that
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
I think we uh were not as clear as we
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
been thank thank you for that and when
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're ready I I I think I still want to
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh propose a table to get this more
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
clear Is there further questions from
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
the any of the members before I accept a
 
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.750 align:start position:0%
the any of the members before I accept a
tabling

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
tabling
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
motion represented thank you Mr chairman
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
so by providing this funding do you as
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
an agency ever go in there to audit or
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
look at their books and their expenses
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:26.910 align:start position:0%
 
short

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
so yes um we have a requirement in all
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
of our contracts with our um substance
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
use providers that they provide monthly
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
um financials and so we look at those on
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
a regular basis we also have been
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
working very closely with Easter Seals
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
to open up their books to take a deeper
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
finances representative
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
Earth does this facility support the
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
getting the people out of New Hampshire
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
hospital for instance and back into the
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
community is this part of that whole
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
process I would not say directly I think
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
that some in some instances someone may
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
um end up at farum Center their primary
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh purpose is to serve individuals who
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
have a substance use disorder um but
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
there is the co-occurring um mental
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
health conditions as
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
well there's no questions oh I
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
just represent I I think in this budget
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
cycle we did a lot to clean up and
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
streamline uh the authority of the
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
drug abuse to invest without
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
interference uh from uh State leadership
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
and I I think I I and we made sure that
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
they had the full access to their 5% I'm
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
I I just think that we're we fully
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
funded substance abuse disorders and I
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like more homework done on this uh
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
please and your motion I have a motion I

and

01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
Recovery Rosen for a question thank you
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman good morning commissioner so
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
when I look at this page there are three
 
01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
items that jump out at me one is uh
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary housing support
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
which um as you and I have discussed was
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
basically putting people in
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
hotels um and we're turning back 7 and a
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
half million the mat withdrawal
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
management well maybe not mat the detox
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
money of $5 million and nothing was
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
spent and the preventing youth
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
homelessness where 19 million of the 25
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
million is being returned these items
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
were from two years ago and so my
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
question basically is what happened why
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
why are we hearing about this two years
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
later and um why specifically weren't
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
these monies spent if this is what we
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
thought we needed to address these needs
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am it's a complicated three part
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
question I guess yes yes it is a
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
complicated question and um um I'll do
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
my best to answer uh for you so the you
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
had the three items that you mentioned
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
here youth residential and the I'll
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
start with those two and the sud
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawal program um the youth
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
residential program was designed uh
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
initially to provide funding to do
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
substantial infrastructure enhancements
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
for uh eligible
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
organizations um under that program and
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
we designed the program in coordination
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
with other part parties including HHS uh
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
around what um the described need was at
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
the time and uh when we got the
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
approvals to the program we launched the
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
program uh we had very few applicants
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
and we made some adjustments to the
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
program to make more uh eligibility for
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
a wider scope of
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
population uh and that remained the case
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
we did get uh applications from a few
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
organizations but for the most part
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
those applications were not necessarily
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
for ma big infrastructure Investments
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
and expansions they were for things like
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC systems and smaller cost items so
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the end yes that program was one of
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of programs that uh resulted
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
in underuse and so they've you know over
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
the course of there's a number of things
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
that have to happen after we did we we
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
um recognized that a program might be
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
underused and the biggest one in terms
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
of time is the fact that we do allow
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
these programs to stay open for some
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
period of time in order to accommodate
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
any unanticipated costs that might come
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
as a result so unpaid invoices and such
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
so we leave those open for quite some
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
time to be able to not have to go back
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
at some point to a program that has been
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
fully closed out um and then secondly um
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
because there there are some of these
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
programs but I wouldn't say there are a
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot it is not a pro it is not um our
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
focus is on the the existing programs
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
both within gopher and with other
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
agencies to make sure that those
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
programs are operating efficiently and
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
spending and having their burn rates to
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
meet all of the the stat the regulatory
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
deadlines that we have and so uh in the
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the course of um reallocating it's
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
more of a scheduled sort of reallocation
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
process than it is uh you know as we get
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
it so I I I don't know if that answers
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
your question on the process I would say
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to the homelessness is
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
item that we discussed so you may recall
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
um back uh sometime a couple years ago
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
now when we were administering the
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
emergency rental relief program and uh
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
that was uh being done uh by New
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority uh
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
that program was one where there were
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
two separate uh Federal programs ra1 and
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
ra2 both had slightly different rules
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
associated with them and there were
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
rules associated with how you spent
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
those funds and how you could apply for
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
more from the federal government we were
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
in a position where that program was
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of use to help individuals
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
pay the rent in their uh in their
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
wherever they were living and so uh we
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
had been repeatedly requesting
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
additional funds to come back from the
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
federal government and they would go
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
through whatever process they would go
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
through to um to redistribute any funds
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
that they had among on all states that
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
were requesting them so at the time I
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe we were uh in December I want to
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
say 21 but it might have been 22 where
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
we had a situation where we were running
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
low on those funds and we had limited
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
locations to be able to put people in
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
going into the the the cold winter and
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
so that's when the question of Hotel uh
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
usage came up and the use of ER funds
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
the the emergency rental relief program
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh to to pay for those we were at a
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
point in time where we had not heard
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
back from the federal government so the
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
decision was made to use arpa funds to
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
cover that that hotel cost and that was
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
in the amount of $20
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
million um that the bulk of those funds
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
were used um I believe the final number
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
was around 17 million and in the end
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
when we did see a
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
u a um an additional payment from the
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal government for the Emergency
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
rental relief program we took 5 million
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
of that to effectively reimburse the
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
arpa funds which then went through that
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
whole process of write down and
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
contractually coming back from New
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and ended up on this
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
list further
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
question but so in terms of the timing
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
because this was
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
the ER one and two
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
was some time
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
ago did you just find out that we
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
weren't spending these funds or could we
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
have known about it last spring when we
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
were working on the state budget and
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could have looked at what we
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
were doing with State funds different ly
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
to address homelessness
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we haven't talked about the
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
withdrawal program yet could we have
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
known this last spring while at least
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate still had control of the
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
budget yes so so so again I would say
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
and i' have to go back to to look at all
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
the exact timing but let's just for
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
conversation sake say that as we got to
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
spring sometime in you know mid April we
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
were clear that there was not going to
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
be any additional expenditures under
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
that program the ER program itself was
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
still in operation and involved a very
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount of administration to
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh to maintain that program uh and to
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
begin the process of closing down those
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
programs uh is within that system that
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
we would have also been going through
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the same process as it related to any
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that were related to that and
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
and and I would just emphasize that
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are there is a significant amount
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
of administrative and Regulatory burden
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we uh have to navigate when we work
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
through the proper use of these funds we
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in a position where we
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
are saying to the legislature we've got
 
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
an extra amount of money here for you to
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
be able to utilize um but it and then
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
have to come back and say oh we were
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
wrong we have to make sure that's
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and um and we're
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
facing the deadlines as you know coming
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
up at the end of this year and uh we are
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
in a somewhat constant juggling process
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're fully aware of
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
where those resources are and what their
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
what their spend rates are so that we're
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
in a position to make sure that all of
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
the funds that we possibly can are
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
obligated adequately by the end of this
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
year so
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
that whole process
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
involves um a good amount of work and I
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
hate to blame it on Administration and
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy but in many cases that is
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
the that is the reason why um we are
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
might be aware of a final number but we
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
aren't able to completely confirm that
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
number to the extent that I can come and
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
say we're ready to spend that money
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
again follow up the withdrawal
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
management 5 million that none of it was
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
spent what was the timing on you must
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
have set up a program no one bid on it
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
when did we know that that $5 million
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
was not going to be spent at
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
all so looking at my notes here and and
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
if I don't have the final dates and I
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
would I would I would ask if I could get
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
you that um because that's a very good
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
question uh I know that we
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
um the initial program closed in um the
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
spring of 2023 but I don't have the
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
exact date so let me get that for you
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
you all right any further questions on
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
this informational
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
item doesn't require a a dispositive
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
motion any other of the information
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%

24105 thanks um on table nine the
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
elderly if you look at midlevel
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
CFI for January it fell off a
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
cliff by 90% of the case load what
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
happened I I think someone's finger fell
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
off their keypad um it it it looks like
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
a data entry error okay and and I'm

Edwards uh thank you uh Mr
 
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
chair coming in today I heard a very
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
static broken up news report that there
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
was a significant uh incident at
 
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
was a significant uh incident at
Hamstead

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hamstead
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
hospital and um I'm and and we you all
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
have worked so hard to get controls and
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
you've had success getting controls of
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
situations at Hamstead since the state
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
took over so I'm just curious um if you
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
could tell us what you can about the
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
incident and if you think this incident
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
is indicative of a of a new trend or is
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
this an anomaly or you know what what's
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
your what's your thought on
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
it uh good morning Marissa hen Deputy
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner at DHHS um and I oversee
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
Hampstead um um thank you for the
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
question uh and as you've probably heard
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the news this week um we are having a
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
rocky period at Hamstead um and uh much
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
as we had a challenging month or so over
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
the summer what we have right now are a
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
very small number of very complicated
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
kids who have acute mental health issues
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
layered on top of um long histories of
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
um trauma and adversity and that
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
presents itself in the course of their
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
treatment as escalated behaviors at
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
times um what I can tell you is that the
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
quality of care and the safety of that
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
facility is superb um for those of us
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
including many of you who spend time
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
inside that facility contrary to what
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
you may hear on the news reports it's a
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
place of healing it's a place of calm
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a place where occasionally that
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
is interrupted on a couple units due to
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
a small number of Youth so um we you
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
know just I want to provide a little
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
history but I think what I want to just
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledge first off is that the the
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
situation there is a stable one and we
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
have a couple youth that are difficult
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we have an incredible staff who are
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
rising to the challenge of using the
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
best therapeutic modalities to address
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
those needs and get those kids the
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
services they need not just during their
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital stay but to help return them to
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
the community and and into lives of of
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully a a brighter um
 
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
future just remember historically
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hamstead previously before the state
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
purchased it had a very different
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
patient population um Hamstead Hospital
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
under its prior for-profit ownership
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
played a really important role in New
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's system of care but it was
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
one that was limited to less acute
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
patients who didn't exhibit the
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
challenging behaviors we're seeing one
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
of our commitments informed by Advocates
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
by the child advocate by the legislature
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
is to keep kids here in New Hampshire
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
who often have some of the biggest
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
challenges and struggles in their lives
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
and not do what occurred previously
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
which was look for facilities far away
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
that could accommodate them part of The
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
Growing Pains of that challenge is
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
making sure that we can serve them well
 
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
while limiting the disruption to the
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
overall millu and the burden on local
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and that's what we're
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to do so under our new CEO Justin
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
lucer who comes from um not only a
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
clinical behavioral health background
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
but an exception history in terms of his
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
ability to help hospitals in New England
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
adapt to the challenges of high Acuity
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
High escalated patients we're getting
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
there but there's going to be some
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
bumpier weeks and we are you know
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
committed to doing everything to
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
supporting our staff making sure they
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
and patients feel safe and get the care
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
they need without um giving up on kids
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
who need our support and uh a facility
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
that truly is a place of quality and
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
healing um
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
healing um
today

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for the followup so
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
so what I think I took away from that is
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
that uh we may actually H be on a cusp
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
of a new trend because of a particular
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
subset of patients that are there uh
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
this this we should not expect this
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
incident to be an anomaly and the last
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
incident it's just the the next one in
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
some reasonably
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
predictable U likelihood of future
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
events I think the way that I would
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
answer that more directly is this
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
facility is absolutely committed and on
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
track to meet the challenges of serving
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
an acute population of complicated kids
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
who have nowhere else to go and we are
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
committed to not giving up on them not
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
simply resorting to you know their
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
languishing in emergency departments or
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
far away States um what I would say is
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
the data that we're tracking over time
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to minimize the house
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
scary some of these situations are for
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
staff and how much um complexity it
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
presents for the incredible First
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
Responders in the Hamstead Community as
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
well as State Police and Beyond um this
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
is uh this is a we are going to have
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
situations that are escalated if you
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
were to look at data from other um
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals across the country if you were
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
to look at data as our CEO has shared
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
from hospitals he worked at it's not out
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the ordinary for us to occasionally
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
have situations where we need to call on
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
police 911 Etc we're not a medical
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
facility um so when someone uh you know
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
tries to hurt themsel for example we
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
have to seek EMT support and sometimes
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
even local hospital support just as any
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
other program serving kids would um so
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to the question is the kids
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go away we have um we
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
have youth who are probably about 1% of
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
those DHHS serves who um have very very
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
acute complex needs their behavior years
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
at time over the course of treatment
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
will escalate what will change is that
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
we are fully committed to being able to
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
manage the vast majority of those on our
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
own um and as you know the the contract
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
for a clinical vendor is there will be a
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
new contract this summer and whether
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
it's the current vendor or a new vendor
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's also an opportunity to revisit
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
how our approaches clinically
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
programmatically bureaucratically are
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
working to make sure that we're rising
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
challenge thank you for the answer and I
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
I and my concern is just we haven't
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
built the new Youth Development Center
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm still just worried about ongoing
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
community support for that new facility
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your answer I understand
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
it completely just just I'm worried
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
about ongoing Community
 
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
issues Senator Rosen question Senator
 
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
Dallas Andro and
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
Senator so I've had
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
conversations with the commissioner and
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
the associate commissioner about one
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
particular child who experienced very
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
long ER
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
stay and in the end hamad's PT prtf
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
declined to take this child um and so
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
the answer was to go to another state my
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
question is since we own this place what
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
is Our obligation to serve the children
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
versus sending them away from their
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
families and out of state are those
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
decisions made clinician to clinician
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
are they made by the administrative
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
staff does the department get involved
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
to say this is one of New Hampshire's
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
kids this is a public hospital and
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
prdf we need to treat our own children
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
where where is that have
 
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility it's a great question and
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
what I would say is when it comes to um
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
some of the youth who uh again this
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
being New Hampshire in a relatively
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
small state um I'm very familiar with
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
the case you're talking about and and uh
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
and many of the first names of these
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
youth who struggle the most become ones
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we um we all know because we are
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
bringing together the department and all
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
the parts that are involved in their
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
care to be more coordinated um that also
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
involves close communication and
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
improved communication with our other
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
providers in the community including
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
those hospitals where some of these um
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
youth uh are are staying I mean one of
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
the things I think what I the way I
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
would answer the question is we build
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the system of care in New Hampshire
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
this Continuum of supports from
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
community-based and prevention and
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
screening through the more um wraparound
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
supports for families in their
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
communities all the way up into
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
residential and impatient um it's it's a
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
big it's a big process of of um
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
unfolding that and we're we're a few
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
years in so what we as a department are
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
doing right now is an assessment of
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
where we are succeeding and where we
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
need improvements and changes one of
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
those as I mentioned is making sure that
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hamstead is prepared and supported to
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
serve the types of Youth that's serving
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
both in a residential facility at the
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
you know that campus at the future YDC
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and and the hospital of course
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
um but there are clearly you know it's
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
only been two years that we've even had
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
contracts for residential providers um
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
such as at the prtf so what we will do
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
in this assessment is identify where are
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
we um where is it working and where are
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
the gaps and how do we through the
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
budget process through legislation
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
through programmatic change fill those
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
in and so an example will be thinking
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
about those youth Who currently are not
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
able to um are too disruptive to the
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
millu in the prtf we can't we have to
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
find a way to serve them and it may be
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
that we need a hybrid approach but what
 
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing through this assessment is
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
looking at what other states have done
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
who are in the similar situation is it
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
because of intellectual and
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities is it because
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
of specialized medical needs how do we
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that the vast majority
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
basically 99% or higher are staying
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
within State um and so I think we are
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
we're getting there but it is going to
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
take more time assessment and then quick
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
action to to finally be able to
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
accommodate all of those youth including
 
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
the ones like the one you're referring
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
to who we um who we deeply want to serve
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
home senator dallesandro for a question
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we have this
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
conversation earlier and I appreciated
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
your response very very much I've been
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
around here a long time I remember Toby
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
I remember Toby and our solution was YDC
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh we were going to make the YDC we took
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
that money from the federal government
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
we were going to solve that problem um
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
we got this other situation where we
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
sent kids out of state which bounced
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
back on us in a very negative fashion
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
now we have the situation at hamston uh
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
and and the question is we're going
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
through a process here
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
and I I think the key to the process is
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
communication to let us know what what
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
is going on MH at any time you get the
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
the the news media involved in it it
 
01:27:00.189 --> 01:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
changes the whole perspective of of that
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
situation that's why I called you and
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
tried to get what what was really go
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
going on there and I think that's the
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
critical issue we we've been evolving
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
I've been here for 50 years we've been
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
in an evolutionary process for the last
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
50 years and and the way to address this
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
one was to get to by Hemstead hospital
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
to take take students that we were
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
sending out of state retain them at at
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital do the best we can as
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
as far as treatment morality is
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
concerned I I think there's there's a
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
risk associated with all of this it and
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
I I think our job is to take that risk
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
and reduce it it and by by doing the
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
things we're doing hopefully we are
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish that that takes care
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
of uh the majority of of the population
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
so I I I think communication is the key
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
in letting letting us know the players
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
in this game what what what's going
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
on that to me that that is that's the
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
key Mr CH and if there's a breakdown
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
there then everyone
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
loses thank you thank you Senator Bell
 
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
question excuse me um
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
who I just learned about the incident
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
this morning from someone else but who
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
was the First Responders was it Hamstead
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh police again EMTs who responded first
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
I believe it was a a mix um of both
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
State Police and Hamstead police last
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
night okay follow up follow up
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
um as you know in the um Youth
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
Development Center meeting we've we've
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
been discussing this is there
 
01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
been discussing this is there
any

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
um was there someone there to greet the
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
First Responders when they got there
 
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.390 align:start position:0%
First Responders when they got there
this

01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
time we we're this the leadership team
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
is currently in meetings um making sure
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
to identify you know to to review what
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
happened and to understand if there's
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
any room for improvement as well as
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that going into the weekend we
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully have some quieter days but but
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
you've brought that up importantly um
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it builds on Senator delis
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
Sandra's point it's communication at a
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
at a conquered level at a sort of
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
strategic and and oversight level it's
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
also Communication in a micro sense of
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that when incidents occur we
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
are managing them with local responders
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
in a way that's maximally effective and
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
respectful of everyone
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
involved final question final question
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
um as you
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
know in speaking with the
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
um select board and the um police
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting continuously F
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
frustrated by the continued calls that
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
they have to do um is there any look at
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
trying it typically the state police are
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the the ones in charge of
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we know they're way down and is
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
there any process or thoughts about
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
putting maybe um stationing some police
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
at that facility so that they will be
 
01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
there in case something like this
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
happens so we're in conversations again
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
as we as we look at the overall safety
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
model um you know per the earlier item
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
there are in general there's safety
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
assessments going on um across state
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
campuses right now uh about an array of
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
situations inside outside um and we
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
actually have as um councelor Stevens
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned it at governor and Council
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
this week we have the results of an
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
overall safety assessment being
 
01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
delivered by um Homeland Security next
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
week so combined with that as well as
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the new contract that's being um
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
developed and will be released this
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
summer or issu or in place this summer
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
um we are always open to looking at that
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
in general um from a hospital security
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint um there aren't permanent
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
police that are usually um in these
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
facilities uh nationally that tends not
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be a a practice um there are um
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
safety staff that are integrated into
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
the millu who get to know the kids who
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
build trust but who also have some
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
specialized skills um I think for now
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
that is the approach that we are seeking
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
but as you and I have had probably hours
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
of conversation this week um we're open
 
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
to all ideas to learning from other
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
models um but fundamentally we want to
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
be able to We believe We can solve for
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
these issues through a clinical and
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach um and and reduce
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
the Reliance on First Responders that's
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
what that's what best practice tells us
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
we can be able to do by having the right
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
activities by wrapping supports around
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
the kids by keeping them busy um
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
adolescents tend to stay out of trouble
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um that is that is where we are
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
emphasizing um approaches while also
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
digging into conversations with Homeland
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
Security and police about what do we
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
need to make the whole Community feel
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
safe and make that campus um stable as
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
well final
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
question final comment I guess I just
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
want you to um be aware that as the
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
First Responders um get
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
frustrated the residents of Hamstead are
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
starting to pay attention especially
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
when you have the media uh owning in on
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
it the residents are starting to get
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
pretty frustrated so we I my feeling is
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
we need to get this
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
moving quicker yeah thank you thank you
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
any further requests for the inform
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
information on the informational items
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee members seeing none
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
before we move on to the audits um like
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%

for is there any problems on that date
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%

01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
one we found the department lacked

adequate controls and did not
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
effectively manage dispute resolution
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%

an issue we first reported on in
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%

01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
Department practices were not always

many dispute resolution practices and
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
requirements were informally developed

01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
however as we discussed in observation
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
numbers 15 16 and 17 the department did
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
not have sufficient and accurate data to
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%

01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
resolution process outputs were limited
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
unreliable and primarily focused on
 
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements while
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
other quantifiable goals objectives and

compliance with the requirements was not
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
monitored or enforced nor did the

agreements resulting from dispute

resolution processes were implemented
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
which contributed to Management's
 
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
inability to determine efficiency
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and achievement of
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%

01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
resolution agreements to be generally
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
unregulated resulting in stakeholders
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns about the use of
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
certain terms and conditions parents
 
01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
reported fears of violating agreements
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
because of these terms and conditions
 
01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
this directly affected legislators the
 
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
Departments and our ability to obtain
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%

addressed and external Communications
 
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
are timely and effective we found the
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
department did not establish and
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
publicize clear lines of commun

01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
and data management controls reliable
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%

decisions and evaluating risk risk
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
management control should be developed

and state
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
laws we found the department lacked
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
records management policies and
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
procedures resulting in records being

incomplete missing or untimely provided
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
to management at times records lacked

sufficient documentation and were not
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
auditable the Department's ability to
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
effectively management manage two
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes was limited
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
in part due to unclear and conflicting
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
record restrictions in state law
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%

making improvements to special education
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes will likely
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
be a multi-year undertaking however
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
conducting a comprehensive analysis of
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
the Department's dispute resolution

regulatory framework evaluating current
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%

approach to prioritize needs and
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
developing and implementing related
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
plans should help assist management with
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
making Necessary
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
changes I would like to thank the
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
department for their help during the
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
audit management and staff were
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
cooperative and work worked hard to meet
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
our reporting
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
timelines unless there are any questions
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
for me I will turn over to Deputy
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Christine Brennan for
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very thorough
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair as I'm looking at
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
your recommendations and skimming
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
through the some of the part partially
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
concur comments uh it it dawned on me to
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
ask the
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
question um do do as you were doing the
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
audit did you do an evaluation of the
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
existing Workforce within the this
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
department to determine whether or not
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
they they actually had the requisite
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
skill set to properly interpret this
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
guidance and to be able to lead the an
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
effort like this this is this is this is
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
serious management issues here as
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
opposed to um uh working the human
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
component of dispute resolution and so
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we have a skill set u
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%
problem I'll let Chris Christine Brennan
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more to it and I
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't mean to criticize anyone there
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
because I don't know anyone there I just
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I mean this is
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is stuff people go to
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
school for and study and get to be
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
really good at I'm just wondering if
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
they have the the workforce to to
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
execute this and for for our audit work
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
purposes it in in observation number
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
three organizational management controls
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
some of those concerns are brought up in
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
terms of having enough resources to
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
carry out these responsibilities
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon I think it's close to
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
that time Christine Brennan Department
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
of Education um first of all I wanted to
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank Christine Young and Paige because
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
we did have um and my team back there we
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
did have beautiful thorough
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
conversations and we were all in
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
agreement that serving um people with
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
special needs and making sure that
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
family understand the processes are um
 
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
there were were there are things that
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
can always be improved I want to thank
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
you for your question because that did
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
commit come up in the our conversations
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
for example our hearing officers and um
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
their role their history was that before
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't use hearing officers and it's
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
best that we do and sometimes getting
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
those contracts and hiring people with
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
those skill sets is difficult another um
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
another way in which we looked at that
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
is looking at the I P facilitate
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
facilitated process where we need people
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
with expertise in the uh process and
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
finding those people to fill fulfill the
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
contract to help the schools make the
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and I think another part of it
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
is and the human part that you're
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
talking about is some of these decisions
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
when kids are when there's a dispute at
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
the local level we want to solve those
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
problems as quickly as possible so that
 
01:47:49.149 --> 01:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
kids are getting uh services and that
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
they need and that families and schools
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
can come to a a faster
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
agreement does that answer your
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
question no because I like yes and or no
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
either either the requisite skill set is
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
already available to implement this
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
these fixes or it's not and we have to
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
go find somebody with the requisite
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
skill sets to add so I'm I was looking
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
answer further
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair could you email us a
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
copy of your presentation that you're
 
01:48:27.119 --> 01:48:28.430 align:start position:0%
copy of your presentation that you're
reading

01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
from so all of these are posted on
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
YouTube with the captions next to it and
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to defer to my director
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
if okay post on YouTube sounds like a
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
video well this is streaming on YouTube
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
and it's observed no no could you
 
01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
actually email us a copy of what you
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
were reading from representative we'll
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
have a transcript um we typically don't
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
give out our presentations we could have
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
notes and everything on it but we will
 
01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
have a transcript of the meeting with
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
everything that P said on a verb attim
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine I guess I was just ask
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
in general we it' be nice if we could
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
get those I mean the executive summary
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
is obviously much shorter than what she
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
read okay and then what she read is much
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
smarter than what's here okay and it
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
really provides a much better map to the
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
whole document I think that's generally
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
true of any of these but this is
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
particularly okay Hefty one Absolutely
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:49:21.719 --> 01:49:23.550 align:start position:0%
sure
representative

01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
so this is really more of a question I
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
think for Mr Cain and um M
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Wier but this um audit
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
will be forwarded to the education
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
Committee of the House and
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
Senate we do um yes we usually send this
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
to the chair of the relevant policy
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
committees uh our audit will provide the
 
01:49:45.239 --> 01:49:46.910 align:start position:0%
committees uh our audit will provide the
necessary

01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
copies and when when do you think this
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
will go to
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
them a next
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
week and one other question do you
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
arrange with them to have a presentation
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
and um have similar to what we've had
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
here today it depends on the chair
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes the chair requests a
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
presentation so there are instances
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
where we do there are other instances
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
where we aren't requested to present so
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
um if you think it would be something
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's helpful I'd probably reach out to
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the house education chair s reach out to
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate education chair and and we
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
can definitely provide our offic and
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
definitely provideed uh a detailed
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
presentation to them as
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
well Mr I I would like to request that
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
where we follow up with having the um
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
education committee at least in the
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
house and I don't know about the how the
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
Senate feels about it but in the house
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the education committee um take a
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
look at this and have a thorough review
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
of it okay I can reach out something we
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
also like to do is especially with
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
something this extensive is get hear
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
from the Department on say a quarterly
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
basis your progress on these items
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
because there's many items listed and
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
you have to list them and tell us what's
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
going on in progress also since the
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee has a responsibility of
 
01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal changes I mean the legislative
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
changes I need a u a liaison from
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed to help us with that
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
and and help formulate it some of us
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
will be the co-sponsors unfortunately
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
nothing will happen probably till next
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
year on as far as getting legislation
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
filed we passed our deadlines but we
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
will be ready to file some legislation
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
on these items that require it so I need
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
a I need a Lia on who I can deal with
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
Education First Senator D thank you
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr CH I would I would e Echo
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
the sentiments of Representative Walder
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
although no one from Senate education
 
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
is here I I think that the presentation
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
before the Senate education committee is
 
01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
really an imperative based on the
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
document that was presented to us
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot here and and I think uh
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
our people should really get their wrap
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
their abs around it's quite significant
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
so I hope that we could pass that on to
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
our education people I'll I'll work with
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes we will do so
 
01:52:20.199 --> 01:52:21.510 align:start position:0%

remediation this concludes my
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
presentation I'd like to thank the
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the Department of
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
Correction staff as well as the

department of administrative services
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
for their cooperation throughout the
 
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
audit um I'll now turn the presentation
 
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
over to commissioner Hanks for any
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
comments she may
 
02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:44.229 align:start position:0%
comments she may
have

02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner I don't know is it good
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh for the record Helen Hanks
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh you know I knew when this
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was going to come forward it was
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to be uh professionally painful uh
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
and that it was uh and uh also uh many
 
02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
of you know that I advocated for
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
electronic Software System to make
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
improvements and assure you that even in
 
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
the areas where we did not uh concur in
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
in whole um we've been making
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
significant strides uh even since this
 
02:04:17.069 --> 02:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
audit period to improve the process um
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
and it was uh to no shock that they
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
recommended additional uh payroll staff
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
because the size of the organization and
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
the complexity that was described based
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
on the number of bargaining agreements I
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
think this audit also affirms that as
 
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
one state that ourselves as a state
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
agency with our partners at Das and dit
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
need to have some uh collaboration and
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
policies that help all of us under this
 
02:04:41.709 --> 02:04:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh Software System and other avenues um
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
navigate these things successfully and
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
clearly it is incredibly important to
 
02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
pay the hardworking uh individuals
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
within our department and any state
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
agency correctly and not to impact their
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
Peg so certainly answer any specific
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
questions yeah it was rather surprising
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
to discover how many collective
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements you have to deal
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
sir and how how is the recruiting
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
efforts you still have a fairly large uh
 
02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate uh we do but I will affirm
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
for you we've had significant um
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
increases in the number of recruits and
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make the comparison as a
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
singular law enforcement agency had just
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
graduated 20 new law enforcement
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
officers and I have 11 in the queue for
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
another Academy and so for our talent
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
acquisition group they're doing an
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
exceptional job and then the retention
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
side of the equation is equally
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
important we have a a decrease in people
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
exiting uh so I want to just appreciate
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
you all for supporting the arpa related
 
02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
recruitment incentives the retention
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
incentives they have helped um steady
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
the ship while we continue to move
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
forward and the support of the
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislature through the budget process
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
and our reallocation um It's Made
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
significant uh strides in our success
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that glad to hear we're
 
02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
having some progress Senator Dall thank
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
just one point maybe the auditor could
 
02:06:00.270 --> 02:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
address this one the the incentive
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
situation if if that isn't clearly
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
understood and not clearly applied if
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy there that cause
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
some concern it's a problems among the
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
among the staff what's what's what's
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
being done to address
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
that this is observation number three
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're asking about
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
yes I mean I can let Kimberly speak more
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
specifically to it but I think here
 
02:06:30.669 --> 02:06:30.679 align:start position:0%
we're just recommending that the
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
department establish agency specific
 
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures related to those
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
programs um you know there's certain
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
nuances for each department and while
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
Services has an overall Statewide policy
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh we recommended strengthening controls
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
by having an agency specific policy to
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
deal with the items listed on page 15
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
items 1 through five and we thought that
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
may help the department in uh
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
strengthening their procedures over this
 
02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.709 align:start position:0%
strengthening their procedures over this
process

02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
CH

02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
CH
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair this
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
is actually with Mr Kane the same
 
02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
comment as the previous one but ALS
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
regarding the presentation but also I
 
02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
note that the summary of the there's no
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
summary basically of the recommendations
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
and the all that stuff it'd be nice to
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
have that as well sure so I'll have
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
meetings with our audit division just
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
kind of go over things that will be very
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for the legislature going
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
forward it's uh both performance and
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
financial um and we'll have those
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
conversations going for that you'd find
 
02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
that very helpful to have it summarized
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh at well that's the summary of her
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
presentation yes but also the the almost
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%

some progress reports as you go and and
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%

six-month basis give us some report on
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
what's going on happy to do that and
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your offer I had a quick
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
chairman push the
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
red uh followup to representative
 
02:09:14.109 --> 02:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
delisandros in that item three yeah I
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
think it said there were like three
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
employees that received a $10,000
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
incentive as far as
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
hiring um
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
I guess I was under the misunderstanding
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
that incentives would be given if they
 
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
were hired and they met the one-year
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
requirement but these you had three
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
people apparently that left after they
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
received the 10,000 has that been
 
02:09:36.189 --> 02:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
changed where someone has to at least
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
complete uh a year of service and then
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
they get the $10,000 or representative
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
Lehman the fiscal item that came before
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
had a specific time in which they would
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
be paid and it wasn't at the onee mark
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
But the fiscal item that did go before
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
you also indicated that if they left we
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
would work with the attorney generals to
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
recruit that money so we are in the
 
02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
process of recouping those those dollars
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
from individuals yeah I saw i' mentioned
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
that you had reached out the Attorney
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
General any success here yet or uh not
 
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
yet but we are very much persevering all
 
02:10:13.069 --> 02:10:13.079 align:start position:0%

to the table of contents you will see
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the report includes four internal
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
control comments none of which are
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
deemed material weaknesses and there's
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
two compliance comments and you'll note
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
observation number six suggests
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislative action may be required the

observations begin on page number
 
02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
three observation number one notes
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
Lottery is unable to develop complete
 
02:12:38.549 --> 02:12:38.559 align:start position:0%

02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
submitted by the gaming operators as
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
part of their monthly Revenue
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
reconciliation process free play wager
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
data a component of the reconciliation
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
is not included on some of the tote
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
system daily reports we recommend
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
Lottery consider amending historical
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
horse racing administrative rules to
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
require the submission of free play
 
02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
activity if this is not
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
feasible Lottery should determine if
 
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
current mitigating controls should be
 
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
strengthened or further mitigating
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
controls could be
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
implemented turning on to page four is
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
observation number two we recommend
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
Lottery update its ineligible players
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
listing policy to require vendors and
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
partner organizations provide listing of
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
all employees working in the United
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
States to comply with muscle and lucky
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
for lifee gaming rules and vendor
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
contracts if Lottery believes its
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
current practice to be sufficient to
 
02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
identify ineligible players Lottery
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
should amend its current vendor
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
contracts to ensure contract language
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
matches current practices and inquire of
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
gaming administrators to determine the
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
policy aligns with gaming
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
rules moving on to Observation number
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
three on page five we recommend Lottery
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
comply with its policy and formally
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
document its quarterly review of user
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
access permissions including the results
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the review it further recommends
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
procedures be implemented to ensure user
 
02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:07.559 align:start position:0%
access is immediately removed for any
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
employee who leave the commission or
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
move to a new role where access is no
 
02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.229 align:start position:0%
move to a new role where access is no
longer

02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
longer
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
required the final internal control
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
observation number four on page six
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
recommends Lottery establishing document
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
of form
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%

02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
documented policies and

begin on page
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
eight with observation number
 
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
five and it notes two out of the four
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
tote system providers operating in the
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
state did not provide sock one type two
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
reports as required by administrative
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
rules this increases the risk that there
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
could be control gaps at the tote system
 
02:14:50.639 --> 02:14:51.549 align:start position:0%
could be control gaps at the tote system

which go unmitigated potentially
 
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
negative negatively impacting historical

horse racing revenues to the lottery we
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%

observation is fully resolved and five
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
are in the process of being
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
remediated this concludes my
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
presentation I would like to thank the
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission management and staff
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
for their assistance and cooperation
 
02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
during the audit and with your
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
permission I will now turn the
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
presentation over to executive director
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
Charles McIntyre for any comments he
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
might have uh good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Charlie
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
McIntyre Lottery director I want to
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank the folks from LBA for their
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
efforts and their industry in this area
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
obviously an important function that we
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
are audited annually uh with me is our
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
chief compliance officer and in
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
his way is making sure of compliance I'd
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
like to note that the clock in the
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee room hasn't been
 
02:16:29.069 --> 02:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
adjusted for dead savings time and still
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
ref 11:17 so I think the fiscal
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee should be in compliance with
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
the we're not perfect
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
either uh with that Mr chair members of
 
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I would happy to answer
 
02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
questions or uh our CFO our chief
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
compliance officer ask Senator Ros thank
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman if I look at page
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
four um at the top
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that we
 
02:16:59.950 --> 02:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
may have undercollected $3 million
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
between last year and this year on
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing and is there um a
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
recouping those funds oh thank you for
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
the question uh Senator uh I don't
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
believe that that um observation is
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
indicating that that is uh an amount
 
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
that is undercollected
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify the current
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
process or the process as it was audited
 
02:17:31.629 --> 02:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
um game operators are uh able to reduce
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh their tax liability uh through free
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
play uh through offering free play
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's a up to a 15% discount um that
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
could be um could be taken out of their
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
taxable uh Revenue um the commission at
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
the time of the audit was monitoring
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
that through periodic audits as we do
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
with um all other forms of gaming um and
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
as uh LBA pointed out uh we also look at
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
Daily reporting with respect to Historic
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
horse racing um and we um but but those
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
daily reports don't include the free
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
play so we had only been doing that
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
review periodically the periodic reviews
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
that we had done had uh tied out uh and
 
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
not had any concern about the amount of
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
free play that was actually being
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
um being identified we haven't had an
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
audit observation that recognizes that
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
um I believe what LBA is looking for
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
though is make sure that we actually
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
strengthen that even more to ensure that
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're doing that and in fact we are
 
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
doing that now as a monthly desk audit
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
um but to to uh your your your general
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
question Senator we don't see any
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
evidence that they were actually uh
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
under payment of historic horse racing
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.719 --> 02:18:51.629 align:start position:0%
 
state

02:18:51.629 --> 02:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
motion move to accept place on file and
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
release of the public in the usual
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
manner second motion and second any
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none you're
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
ready for the question all in favor say
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
I I those no um than chairman
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
congratulations I know you get audited
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
every year I guess the newest game is
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
the only one that had a few blips in it
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
because the rest of it is running
 
02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
smoothly I will see to it that um at
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
least no later than the next budget that
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
this amount of transfer money is
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted that dollar figure goes back to
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
I think 2008 when we were doing $120
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
million in sales and this year we do 320
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
million and so it's you know it's we're
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
selling too many tickets we wait to see
 
02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:40.519 align:start position:0%
your recommendation for the figure
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Mr chairman thank you we
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
make sure it's it's in the
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:51.309 align:start position:0%

strengthen its controls over the receipt
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%

policies and proc
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
procedures ensuring that all items
 
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:01.840 align:start position:0%

receipt and are properly accounted for
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
ensuring staff involved are familiar
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
with the payment requirements and
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all equipment items of

perform a thorough physical inventory of
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%

beginning on page six we recommend the
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
commission estabish establish formal

02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
that require a commission match we
 
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
recommend the commission review periodic
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
reports of product price changes and
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
depletion allowance offers that require
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
a match to ensure that they were
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
formally approved by the Commissioners
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%

and five begin on page seven observation
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
number four recommends the commission
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
develop a disaster recovery plan which
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
should be periodically tested reviewed
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
and updated as needed and the commission
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
should continue to establish a formal

process of being
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
remediated this concludes my
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
presentation I'd like to thank the
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission for their assistance
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
and cooperation throughout the audit and
 
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
with your permission chairman well I'd
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
like to turn the presentation over to
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
Chairman mikica for any comments he may
 
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
have commission welcome thank you very
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman members of the
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record Joseph

mikica chairman of the New Hampshire
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and you know Tina
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
demir's our CFO and James V our coo like
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
to thank Christine Jim and and Jean as
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know we get audited every year and
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
we take our audit observations seriously
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
and always take responsibility for the
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
findings and we address observation and
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
answer questions before that we need to
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
point out that three of the five
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
observations are it resource related
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
I've discussed this with commissioner
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
gluay and we're moving forward in a
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
different direction with our it in the
 
02:27:20.349 --> 02:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
future observation number one the first
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
observation as a result of human error
 
02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
due to the 36y old system with limited
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
it resources to maintain the system and
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
migrate to the nextg system the two main
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
employees with institutional knowledge
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
of this system are retirees that come
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
into the office part-time and let me
 
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
just state that we have been blessed to
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
have these two employees come these two
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
gentlemen come in and assist us during
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
this massive transition there's very
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
little embedded information
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
other than what these two individuals
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
have um over a 40-year period this
 
02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
system probably should have been
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
upgraded four times and it wasn't as
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
noted in the observation in 2022 there
 
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
is an inherent risk in running the
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
Legacy system with riing on retired
 
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:10.830 align:start position:0%
Legacy system with riing on retired
staff

02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:28:13.469 --> 02:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
resources we raid the risks of
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
continuing operations with the current
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
system and the risk of deploying the new
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
system before it was ready before we
 
02:28:22.990 --> 02:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
considered it was ready implementing the
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
nextg system before was ready would have
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
put hundreds of millions of dollars at
 
02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
risk unfortunately one of these
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
gentlemen made a mistake and this is the
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
result the good news is that the go live
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
date for the next gen system is in two
 
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
weeks and will take place on April 1st
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
everything is being transitioned now
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
from the new system to the old system
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
the data is being loaded into the new
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
system so April 1st we're ready to go
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
we'd like to put on the record that this
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
discovery was internally corrected and
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
self-reported to the LBA by the
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
nhlc we have not notified or invoiced
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
the lies for several reasons first we
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to make ensure that the invoicing
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
was correct which is a huge undertaking
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
because it took place in two different
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
years because the data mining involved
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the old system is again back to
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
limited resources and especially
 
02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
difficult while you're trying to
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
implement a new system so you say why
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
was it so difficult well there's power
 
02:29:30.429 --> 02:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
buys to be involved one-time buys sale
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
pricing post off broker discounts
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
monthly sales all have to be taken into
 
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
consideration go back and make sure that
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
we're charging these lenses the correct
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
amount for everything that they bought
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
over that period of time each product
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
and transition had to be fully vetted to
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
ensure proper price pricing and
 
02:29:55.469 --> 02:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
accuracy and that has been done secondly
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to wait until this audit was
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
complete and give the committ committee
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to weigh in as
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
businessmen and women our opinion is
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
that we should invoice the lenses for
 
02:30:10.429 --> 02:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
the outstanding funds owed to the state
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
apologize for any inconvenience to them
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%

result of an the it lead at the time who
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
was no longer at the commission signed
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
off on a receipt of a bundle of
 
02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
equipment and approved payment to our I
 
02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
to our project manager without
 
02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
verification when the equipment was
 
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
received it was palletized and stored in
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
the warehouse and not discovered of the
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
shortage until it was taken down to be
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
deployed as part of the new system after
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
this discovery of a was made a full
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
inventory was done and it was determined
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
that this was an isolated incident it
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
did not it did not involve any alcohol
 
02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
at all and significantly we have now
 
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
