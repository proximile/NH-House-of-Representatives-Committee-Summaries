sheets here right here uh there's one
 
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
which has the agenda on it and and uh
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's another one that is the uh
 
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
minutes of what we did at the previous
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
meeting that was on March 27th and
 
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's another sheet which shows it's
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's addresses the issue of civics
 
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
it's addresses the issue of civics
education

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I thought today looking at our agenda
 
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.450 align:start position:0%
um I thought today looking at our agenda
that

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.050 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
we have a number of issues on our plate
 
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
here we specifically have the ed306
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
rules which we've been looking at that
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to have a a discussion on
 
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
those as well then we also have on
 
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
number five on that agenda Civics
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
education and I put that on the scene
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
that has been approved in hb2 now the
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
one million dollars to develop a
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
textbook on Civics education K through
 
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.510 align:start position:0%
textbook on Civics education K through
12.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I wanted folks to know exactly where
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
the statutory language that we have in
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
place right now in New Hampshire law
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
and it came from the state of Ohio and I
 
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
I have the Civics education uh uh format
 
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
and formula everything they have in Ohio
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
and apparel is exactly what we have we
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
put in the statute here and we'll I'll
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
explain all that mental health is
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
another issue that's which I think is a
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
very important issue in the state right
 
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.370 align:start position:0%
very important issue in the state right
now

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.689 align:start position:0%
now
and

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.350 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
um

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
input from our school districts that it
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
seems to be a topic that's uh explosive
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
that we have number of students which
 
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
are displaying
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
health issues and we have three bills
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
which we have retained in-house
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
education regarding that topic and
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
whether the the concern that I'd like to
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
talk about today on that one is
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
um where do we place that we place it if
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
we do something with it in 193e under
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
adequacy or under studies or as a part
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
of Health and Wellness uh that that's a
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
conversation which we might be able to
 
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
get some sense of direction on then I
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
have under seven other and I like to do
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
right now is does everybody know
 
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 align:start position:0%
everybody up here at the table
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
you're good with that all right so I
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
like to approve the agenda and at that
 
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 align:start position:0%
this time if there's something else that
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
people would like to put on this let's
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
get it on added to it the agenda there's
 
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
a lot here
 
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.809 align:start position:0%
a lot here
um

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything else being added but
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
okay great then is there a motion to
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
approve the agenda so okay motion made
 
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 align:start position:0%
by the senator award and second by
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
um now we have the minutes from the
 
00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
previous meeting and we had nobody
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
taking minutes so I wrote some minutes
 
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
up briefly on that I think we ought to
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
look at that and maybe if somebody wants
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
to take meds they're welcome to do so or
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
we continue to do it this way
 
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.110 align:start position:0%
we continue to do it this way
um

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
you haven't had a chance to read any of
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
that I think everybody should take a
 
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
moment or two to read them over to see
 
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
if it's reflective or see if it really
 
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.809 align:start position:0%
if it's reflective or see if it really
States

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
some of what we discussed there's
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
anything

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
to my right
 
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.790 align:start position:0%
to my right
nothing

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay you're making money okay
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
representatively made a motion to
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
approve is there second okay
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
um any discussion on on the minutes
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
all this favor
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
see unanimous okay so we can put the the
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
minutes aside
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
and get into the order in which we want
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
to address some of the issues in front
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
of us here today the first one I I noted
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
on the docket for today is Ed 306
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
preliminary minimum standards for public
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
school approval and you'll note on the
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
bottom of the agenda there are the dates
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
for the hearings that Fred bermati is
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
presenting regarding Ed 306 to locales
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
um I guess the first thing I'd like to
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
ask is there anybody that has attended
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
well I I plan on doing the last one in
 
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.230 align:start position:0%
well I I plan on doing the last one in
Concord

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
but uh is there any feedback yes
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
sure thanks
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
um thanks Rick uh Mel and I actually
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
attended one a few several weeks ago
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
over at Bow high school and um and we
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
were we were a little surprised about
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
how the um the the the presentation went
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh you know we know we know Fred
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
vermonte pretty well and um and I know
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
he's certainly committed to uh to strong
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
student outcomes
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
um uh for New Hampshire for New
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School students but uh
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
but he didn't really spend much time
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
talking about the proposed changes nor
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
what the effects would be in terms of
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
outcome he talked a lot about background
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
um this um maybe this committee could
 
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.509 align:start position:0%
um this um maybe this committee could
provide

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:29.540 align:start position:0%
um Mr bramonte with with some feedback
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
only as as
 
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know it looks like that that there's
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
um the next meeting coming up is
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled for June 27th and then it goes
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
into September and I think he was going
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
to have like 20 or so of these um forums
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
but um but you know I'm not trying to be
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
critical in a in a negative way but you
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
know in a way that I I think would be
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of um uh disseminating
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
information that's material to the
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
proposed changes so that um so that Fred
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
can get the the critical feedback he's
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
looking for from
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
from people who attend these sessions
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
was there a lot of good input coming in
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
or was there not good input coming in
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
my perspective is it it lacked any sort
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
of detail on what the proposed changes
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
were and uh it sort of spent more time
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
on the background that led to the
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
changes or leading to the proposed
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
changes as opposed to what the proposed
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
changes are
 
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:41.420 align:start position:0%
and um and and he did get some feedback
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
that from from uh some members in the
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
audience that some people in the
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
audience that that sort of suggested hey
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail on on you know
 
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
what the what the proposed changes are
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
would be helpful was there any
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding some of those
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
changes in terminology of competencies
 
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.220 align:start position:0%
first proficiency and Mastery no or or
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
expectations yeah there wasn't that type
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
of discussion and and Mel and I have had
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with with Fred one-on-one
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
on that Mel maybe you want it yeah
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
I uh followed up on that conversation
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
I have a conversation with Fred
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
following the the um
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
bow meeting and gave him some
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
suggestions on being a little more
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
substantive I mean Fred wants to hear
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
from people there's no question that's
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
his intent
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
but there was no opportunity really to
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of feedback that I
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
thought he was really looking for
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
and I gave him several suggestions on
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
how to open up the sessions now
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that we've gotten feedback
 
00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
from some of our committee members that
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
went to the one in cursage
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
and also there was one in Keene that
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
followed the bow meeting
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
and uh my feedback we've been getting is
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
that it's basic hasn't changed much of
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
this presentation which is unfortunate
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
because I think this is a his goal is to
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
get feedback but I don't believe from
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
what I'm gathering he's not getting a
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
lot of feedback because of how he's
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
presenting it and I I wish that he would
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
um be a little more definitive on laying
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
out what the changes are and then
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
getting feedback from what he's saying
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
to people
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's coming I know
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
Patty you were I I went to the one June
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
5th at Memorial and it was almost 45
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
minutes of a PowerPoint of why this the
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
history of this going back to 1995 the
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
things that came out in 2007
 
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
um what competencies are as opposed to
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
just getting pass or feel or getting
 
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
just getting pass or feel or getting
grades

00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
grades
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
um Mastery versus proficiency and then
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
and like nobody in the audience had been
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
told anything about what was in the 306
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
changes so there's no discussion
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
regarding acknowledgment versus mastery
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
I I had the side by side because we had
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
before and I asked the question about
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
that I was concerned with shells being
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
changed to Maize in May provide from
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
shall provide and my only answer was
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
so really and and I know that he did a
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
presentation for the Manchester School
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
Board who wrote him I guess pages of
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
their concerns and suggestions and he
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
did acknowledge that but he also said
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's nice to get suggestions for changes
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
but you know you don't know if they're
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.410 align:start position:0%
going to happen
so

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.689 align:start position:0%
so
hmm

00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
was were the sessions well attended or
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
but it was
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
school board members
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
elected officials you know and one
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
person in the audience brought this is
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
very nice and and the way you explain
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
everything but if you're just a regular
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
old parent that's not involved in any of
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
this you don't know what you're talking
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
about we don't understand what you're
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
talking about at all so I mean even the
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
presentation of the way it is it's
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
presented so that people who are
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
involved in education can understand it
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
but your parent will only who has kids
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to school and that's their
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
involvement with education doesn't
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
was there any reference at all to the
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know when we have the individual
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
subject areas
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
identified within our rules be it
 
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
mathematics physical education Health
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's also elements underneath which
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
try to define those skills and that
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
knowledge that study there's a gap
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's been taken out of these rules was
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
I mean if if it would be nice if Fred
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
had the side by side because I think
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
that really that provides some sense of
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
background to what's a change whether
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
you agree with them or not is irrelevant
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
the point is this is what they are
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why when we got them
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
from the committee standpoint that was
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
very instructive to begin to look at
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
that and I just don't none of that and
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned because there were at
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
least a bow and I'm assuming that the
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
others there were members of the
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
um committee or whatever they called
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
themselves that created this there were
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
members of them there but they didn't
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
seem to be engaged at all in the process
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping that some of them would
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
be able to give further feedback to Fred
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
about what you needed to do to think
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
about this or whatever but it doesn't
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
seem that the basic format at least at
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
this point in time has really changed
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
that much because I did do a follow-up
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
on when he went to Keene he went from
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
Beau to King the next night and to see
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
if he'd made any changes in that and
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
from what I understand there was really
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
it was basically the same same
 
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.470 align:start position:0%
it was basically the same same
presentation

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned I'm concerned that I
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't think he's getting what he really
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
and and Rick yeah I I think it would
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
also be important to
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
um you know during these public
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um uh sessions for um for Mr bervante to
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
um how the flexibility that that he's
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
suggesting and that Patty uh referenced
 
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
how that could manifest in terms of
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
different versions of of public school
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
and um and you know to be able to meet
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh a flexible uh minimum standards uh or
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
be compliant with a flexible minimum
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
standards document and um and be able to
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
say well in this community public school
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
could look like this and in this other
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
community public school could look like
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
this and uh and and you know rather than
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
just using the term flexible I I think
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
people have
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
um I know I have a better uh easier time
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
understanding if you can sort of fit a
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
hypothetical into that and say well now
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
I see what this looks like now I see
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
what that could look like and uh taking
 
00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.289 align:start position:0%
what that could look like and uh taking
taking

00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
um taking people through some of those
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
examples I think could be very helpful
 
00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.340 align:start position:0%
how did this really impact local control
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of of uh my district being able
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to have 24 required
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
credits to get out of here first 20 here
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
in this one uh how how is are these new
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
standards proposed draft standards
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
laying up against that ability the the
 
00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:21.860 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements set by the local
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
which they have the right to do now
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
and there's also requirements of of the
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
state which we've identified through
 
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.310 align:start position:0%
state which we've identified through
rule

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um is there that flexibility being taken
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
or is it do you know yeah I I I don't
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that was discussed but I think
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a good that's an example
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
of a hypothetical that that I think
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
would would help members of the public
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
really understand what's being and would
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
help us too
 
00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:50.690 align:start position:0%
help us too
um

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
um you know understand what's being
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
proposed would it help if we invite Fred
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
to this meeting of one of our meetings
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
and we have more folks here so we could
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're more in tune with rules
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
every day just about we're looking at I
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think I think that makes a lot of
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
sense Rick I would I definitely given
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
given give giving him time to sort of
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
prepare and understand what our um
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
um interests are going to be in that
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
meeting and um
 
00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.169 align:start position:0%
meeting and um
um

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I think identifying what
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Meyer said lay out the
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
changes yeah
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I think what what has he found I
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
mean by the time we would have him come
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
here you might assume sometime in the
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
fall yeah you know what has he found
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
what's the feedback that he's getting
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
from them uh and what are some of the
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
suggested changes that the committee
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
made are you looking at as they begin to
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
deal with their final draft going to
 
00:20:50.409 --> 00:20:50.419 align:start position:0%
look forward to it
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
so now it's not our requirement to we
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't approve the minimum standards of
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
public school approval those are
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly School State Board of
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
Education responsibility
 
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
but it certainly does impact
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh I I I there may not be a direct
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
linkage with our our
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards in the subject areas
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
and the criteria and the substance
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
criteria which we have for an adequate
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know I I you know I I remember when
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
we put health and wellness the wellness
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
came out of the Ed 306 and supported our
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
changing it in at in our uh opportunity
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education that
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
substantive criteria that's where we got
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
the word wellness and we're able to
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
really substantiate it because that's
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
what people are doing
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
so I think there is a linkage and I
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
think we have a good position to be
 
00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.059 align:start position:0%
requesting him to come and discuss with
 
00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:55.730 align:start position:0%
requesting him to come and discuss with
us

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that I didn't even
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
know about these meetings so I couldn't
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
go to any one of them although I would
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
have but there's quite a few of them up
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
within easy driving distance yeah right
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
so I will have to go to the September
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
12th one and I think that's one of the
 
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.700 align:start position:0%
issues yeah I think he's had a problem
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
in in the advertising of these meetings
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
coming forward but in most cases they
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
would have been through a local school
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
newsletter or from a superintendent in
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
the school districts that they're in but
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
the actual Statewide thing there's not
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
been a lot of hype around right you need
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
to get to see these the other places you
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
can work so I'm sorry that I just saw
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
these because they have been out but
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
they've been not widely known well the
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
last one should be good because if it's
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
received on your input well that's why I
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
was expecting the last one to go to
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
but the rules they were last adopted
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
back in 2015 that's when we changed them
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
and every 10 years yeah
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're rolling in on on 2025.
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's what they're trying
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
to prepare for here uh
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
when would be a good time for us to try
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we're jumping it when
 
00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:14.539 align:start position:0%
we'd have our next meeting but
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
if Fred's able to come we ought to try
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
to and give us some information
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
regarding these changes and what she's
 
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:24.380 align:start position:0%
getting us feedback from those schools
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
and side by side information I think
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
that'd be very helpful for us
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
and for him sometime in mid-september or
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
something okay yeah if the last one is
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
yeah mid-september then give him time to
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
or even even early October right yes
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure when these are are do
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
we know the date that they're supposed
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
to go to the State Board
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay I think after all of his healings
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
because I think what happens is that
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
through the state board's credit
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
but they did receive the uh
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
initial draft they basically moved to
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
the side for these hearings to take
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
place before they actually started that
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
60-day process
 
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:27.890 align:start position:0%
60-day process
foreign

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
so then mid-september early October I
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
think would be in line to have him come
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
in and and do a presentation for us are
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
we all good with that request
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
good is there any need to stay on the
 
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
issue of Ed 306 at this time
 
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.649 align:start position:0%
issue of Ed 306 at this time
no

00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh jumping down to the next one
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
which we have which is civics education
 
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.210 align:start position:0%
which we have which is civics education
and

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
on on the the large
 
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.649 align:start position:0%
on on the the large
packet

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
packet
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
where there's a 63 that's item 60 and
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
and this is the language which is Pierce
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
in law that's underlined which
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
stipulates that there's going to be the
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
sum of one million dollars for fiscal
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30 2023 which shall not
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
lapse for the purpose of developing and
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
creating a New Hampshire Civics textbook
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be distributed to every New Hampshire
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
Civics classroom
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm assuming that this will
 
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:36.860 align:start position:0%
probably get signed into law
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think there's a really good chance
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
seeing the governor when in his
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
presentation has Civics as an issue that
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
 
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.690 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
um

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.370 align:start position:0%
 
I've

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:54.380 align:start position:0%
I've
 
00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:58.580 align:start position:0%
put into this packet of materials
 
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:00.980 align:start position:0%
uh information
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:09.500 align:start position:0%
on like page three
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
the results of the nape and I think
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
we're all very familiar with the results
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
nape this is information which is posted
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the doe website
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
that the Nationwide we did very poorly
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of civics education there for
 
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.570 align:start position:0%
in terms of civics education there for
hb2

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
so that information is available I don't
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
think there's necessary to get into a
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
lot of that that's there for your
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
information so jumping ahead to page
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
seven now I want to just explain that
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
within statute
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
and in statute is
 
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.830 align:start position:0%
and in statute is
um

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh on pay it's on it's a it's stapled to
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
the back side of your agenda there's 189
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
no that's all regarding the second one
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
um we do have it's the part that's
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's in this package awesome it's
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
in this set yeah it's it's on page eight
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
if we go to page eight that's what I'm
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
looking for 189 colon 11. instruction in
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
Nationals in State history and
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
government and we have in our statute
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
right now A through J those are areas of
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
study dealing with uh the United States
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire government Civics
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
course at a minimum the course shall
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
include instruction in these a through J
 
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.130 align:start position:0%
include instruction in these a through J
areas

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
and this is for information the first
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
item there you can see opportunities and
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for civic involvement
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 10 of this document
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
that I have before you here this comes
 
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:55.580 align:start position:0%
out of the plan from the state of Ohio
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
which adopted their model social studies
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
curriculum in 2019. Senator Dale's
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
Andrew and I put these a through not J
 
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:12.260 align:start position:0%
but a through I into statute back around
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
2017-18 when this was still draft but
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
this has since been adopted by Ohio but
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
the Ohio has four basic strands in their
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
social studies program
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.169 align:start position:0%
 
geography

00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
geography
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
and economics those are the strands
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
within the government strand there is a
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
Civic involvement strand
 
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
Civic involvement strand
and

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
you can see that the content statement
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
optimally specific engagement within
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
structures of government
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
are made possible through political and
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
public policy process and we have
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
occupational responsibilities for civic
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
involvement we modified language a
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
little bit but they're similar if you
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
went down to Item B
 
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
went down to Item B
foreign

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
on pages 10 through 11 B says skills to
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
effectively participate in civic affairs
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about right
 
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.010 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about right
there

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.570 align:start position:0%
there
um

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
so we took that you know uh political
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
parties interest groups and me to
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
provide options for civic involvement
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
through various means that's in the Ohio
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
plant on D C excuse me
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
um it's reflected on 12 and 15. C says
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution principle stated in
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
the Articles of Amendment of the United
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
States Constitution that provide the
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
foundation of democratic government of
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
the United States that is right there on
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
pages 12 and that in that we just stole
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
and same thing for Eve we're supposed to
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
be talking about the structure and
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
function of three branches comprising
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
federal state governments legislative
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
judicial and executive if you look at
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
you can see it talks directly about the
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
three branches of government
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
another thing we just took from that
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
state they had put their model together
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
with with
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
Consultants with teachers with people
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
teaching it in with various associations
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
it was a task force put together to
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
develop this curriculum that they have
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
and then uh going on down to the next
 
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
and then uh going on down to the next
one

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
F the role opportunities and
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of citizens to engage
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
in Civic activity if you go to page 18
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
you can see that there it says in the
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
United States people have the rights to
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
protect them from undue government
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
interference rate rights carry
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to help Define how
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
people use the rights and require
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
respect for the rights of others
 
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:00.740 align:start position:0%
um and they they talking about
 
00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.549 align:start position:0%
um and they they talking about
engagement

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
and that's item number 15 in their
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
content statement
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
so we took that one as well
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
um on G where it says the role of
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
interactions the state of New Hampshire
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
and local governments within framework
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
of the United States Constitution
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
obviously we didn't take Ohio's because
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
but they do have that on page 1920 we
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
just have written in New Hampshire that
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
we want to be also teaching about Civics
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
on the local level and the state level
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
and which is on H the how federal state
 
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
and local governments address problems
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
and issues making decisions creating
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
this and you can see item 20 Page 21
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
they also have that as
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
um individuals and organizations play a
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
role within federal state and local
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
governments and helping determine public
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
domestic and foreign policy
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and it speaks to it a little bit down
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
below on item 20 in theirs as well and
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
also uh the last one I the rule in the
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
actions of government and the flow of
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
economic activity and regulation of
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
monetary policy that came specifically
 
00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh on on theirs on page 22 you can see
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve System uses monetary
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
too is to regulate the nation's monetary
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
Supply and moderate the effects of
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
expansion and Contra contraction in the
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
economy and they talk about the the feds
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the in that system
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
so so we took this now I also took a
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
little bit of time and went through and
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
say okay what are they doing in terms of
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
civics education for all the grades and
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have taken and you can see on page
 
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.930 align:start position:0%
they have taken and you can see on page
23

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
children continue to build on their
 
00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:51.539 align:start position:0%
understanding of chronological timelines
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
and calendars that are introduced in
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
grade two
 
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.330 align:start position:0%
grade two
um

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
this is the grade one social studies
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum which they had in Ohio and
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
every grade level seems to they carve
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
out Civics within government
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
and it's something that maybe we ought
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
to be looking at when we're developing a
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
textbook I know it's uh not our
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility do that I didn't
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
understand within hb2 where it says the
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education colon
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Commission on New Hampshire
 
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.269 align:start position:0%
commissioner Commission on New Hampshire
civics

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
civics
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
Commission on New Hampshire Civics what
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
can who's on that Commission
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire Civics I don't know
 
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:40.580 align:start position:0%
if it's a commission
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's a non-profit yeah
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who's going to be
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
writing this thing uh appropriate to the
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
Department of commission New Hampshire
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
Civics established in RSA 21nhc I went
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.009 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
some of the million bucks
 
00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:08.930 align:start position:0%
some of the million bucks
um

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I you know so in writing this thing I
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
think it's important that because this
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
is going to impact our responsibility
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
for oversight on this area which is
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
within an adequate education
 
00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:25.070 align:start position:0%
within an adequate education
yeah

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
on um the executive director of New
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics uh has has resigned a
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
Martha Madsen and she's left they've got
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
they do have an interim uh acting there
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that's and that organization
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
primarily deals a lot with the social
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
studies teachers Etc the other thing is
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
is that there is an organization
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
I've been tangentially uh
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
in contact with and that is they're
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
working on Civics and civility
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is dealing with the primary
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
election and again uh Mr bramante has
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
been the key uh factor in that and it's
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
the the design of that is to try to do
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is doing only from a
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
political standpoint as far as the
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
election goes it's a bipartisan effort
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
to engage students not only in this
 
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:28.940 align:start position:0%
state but across the country actually
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be engaged in the primary election
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
but there's a whole program that they're
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
developing that's a lot of this content
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's here Rick that leads up to the
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
primary election where students from
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
across the region and across the country
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
can get involved in this and
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
um they're moving right along and
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
they've got sponsors and they're
 
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.020 align:start position:0%
developing they're developing
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
programs curriculum that would provide
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
engagement of students in this process
 
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
that with the culmination of it
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
basically being engaging with candidates
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
that are running for uh the presidential
 
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
primary uh presidential election
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
but those are just two things that
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
directly relate to the Civic stuff the
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
the reason why I bring this topic up if
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
you look on the agenda on the back side
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's some statutory language on page
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
two of the agenda there
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
and it's 193 E2 Dash a substantive
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
educational content of an adequate
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
um it's our responsibility I see these
 
00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:50.150 align:start position:0%
um it's our responsibility I see these
as

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
standards of what we teach academic
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
standards subject areas
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
correctly if I'm mistaken but so then
 
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.069 align:start position:0%
correctly if I'm mistaken but so then
somehow

00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
if we're getting down and we're now
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to be contracting out somebody to
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
do I have no problem with that I have no
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
problem with other groups getting
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
involved and writing this but they've
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
always come back for approval they have
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
to come back for approval by the state
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
board and the state board but if it
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
comes to academic standards the
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight company is
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for reviewing and
 
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.290 align:start position:0%
responsible for reviewing and
recommending

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong in that one no I
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
think I think no I think that's right
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
out of the statute that's right on the
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
Statue I I do have a question though
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
um page eight
 
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.170 align:start position:0%
um page eight
um

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.130 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
part h
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is um which you've got reference
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
to uh the Ohio
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
um page 132 which is 21 at page 21 in
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
this packet I'm not quite sure I'm
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
seeing the the the the direct reference
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
to Ohio's plan
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
as it as it relates to how federal state
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
and local governments address problems
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
and issues by making decisions creating
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
laws enforcing regulations and taking
 
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.970 align:start position:0%
laws enforcing regulations and taking
action

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:16.380 align:start position:0%
because that's sort of the the
 
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.210 align:start position:0%
because that's sort of the the
um

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not trying to say we need to
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
be using Ohio at all no no say I'm just
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
trying to show that this is the
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
historical background of how we got to
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
what we did right right but and I and I
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
think having a having a model from
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
another state is sort of helpful when
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
when looking at how you go about
 
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.010 align:start position:0%
when looking at how you go about
defining

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
defining
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
um you know you know these these various
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards in a way that that
 
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a a partisan you know
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
um sweat because Civics can sort of
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
easily easily you know fall into that
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
trap and um and H I think is
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
particularly interesting because it
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
basically references how the three
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
branches of of government operate
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
um to address problems and issues by
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
making decisions
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
executive creating laws legislative
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
enforcing regular regulations executive
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
and taking action that would be a
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
combination of executive and judicial
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and be great if Ohio had had
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
yeah see they talk about the the those
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
the three branches at all levels
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
addressing public policy issues that
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
arise domestic International that's on
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
page page 20.
 
00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.430 align:start position:0%
page page 20.
um

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
21 talks about more of like the Public's
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
ability that you engage in government
 
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.310 align:start position:0%
ability that you engage in government
yeah

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
um at the top of the top of page 21 and
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
and then 20 that the bottom of page 21
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
number 20
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
yeah explain how the federal government
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
but not how the government addresses
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
problems yes yeah right yeah and issues
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
and obviously I think that's a that's a
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
big thing is what we're seeing play out
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
with the news from last week too and I'm
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
not trying to make it make it political
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
here but but you know it doesn't help
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
when when people get up and say you know
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
the weaponization of the Department of
 
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.170 align:start position:0%
the weaponization of the Department of
Injustice

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
Injustice
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't help
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
well I think we're just going to have to
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
it that that's hopefully what we would
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
do with a good Civics program as we
 
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.370 align:start position:0%
do with a good Civics program as we
would

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
teach people about Civics and how to
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
engage and try to get resolution in a
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful lasting memory so
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
I I I you know I know there's a lot of
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
different Civics programs out there but
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just wanting to just try to figure
 
00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:27.290 align:start position:0%
I'm just wanting to just try to figure
out

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
Commission in the okay from the budget
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
so that was in hp2 yeah the commission's
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
in there has like the textbook stuff
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.820 --> 00:42:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's just assassinated into the book
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
here yeah well yeah it's it's yeah I was
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
looking at one section hp2 is another
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
section this part right here on the
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
other side of it
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that this
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
um also talks about the textbook
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
um and even a paper copy of the textbook
 
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.349 align:start position:0%
um and even a paper copy of the textbook
whereas

00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong Senator Ward
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of discussion
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um about this textbook during the Senate
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
budget hearings there was um an
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
amendment put forward by Senator
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro to cut the one million
 
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro to cut the one million
dollars

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
because he didn't think that a textbook
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
was actually required and I think the
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
um other side of that coin that Senator
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
Bradley talked about was that it didn't
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a a paper text
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
but but could be digital
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
um because there were concerns about the
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
cost of doing a hard copy textbook and
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
distributing to all the schools and
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that's a a question
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
that will play out as we go forward in
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
terms of the million dollars and what
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
kind of textbook we are actually looking
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
at producing
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion and I
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
think with it if you have a digital book
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
you can go in easily and make the
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
changes whereas with a printed book you
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
have to you know reprint it and
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
redistribute it
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
so I attended that meeting on that
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon Friday that when
 
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.290 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon Friday that when
Finance

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's the one where Senator gray and
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley etc etc and then Senator
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
dalessandro and and and Cindy were there
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
um

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
I can remember Senator Lou D'Alessandro
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
questioning okay if we're going to have
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
a textbook
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
who's going to print it you know who all
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with it uh who's
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
gonna write it uh and he was advocating
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
for uh the people that are the social
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
studies teachers organizations
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
Etc to be contributors
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
to this process and when it was cut to a
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
then he he said well I don't know if
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to do it for a
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
million bucks if we're talking about
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
everybody the 160 000 kids
 
00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
with a textbook and of course and one
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
textbook's not going to be good for you
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
know grade six and grade
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
10 or 11. there's different contents in
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms of civics and how you present it
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
and topics and and and it has to be a
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
scope and sequence type Affair uh so I
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
think he was coming from his perspective
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
of being a social studies teacher and
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and he alluded to other flying folks of
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
what he has had in his classes and that
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
he has taught
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
and he he said that
 
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.030 align:start position:0%
and he he said that
um

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
i i i i he likes he's he's a textbook
 
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.370 align:start position:0%
i i i i he likes he's he's a textbook
person

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
but I I think that when then the
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner spoke out and said well we
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
can do this digitally with a million
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
dollars and trying to I think even try
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
to protect the money for the whole
 
00:45:35.819 --> 00:45:36.650 align:start position:0%
to protect the money for the whole
program

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an issue which I think is
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
still up in the I know you see a written
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
copy here but I I'm confused on that
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
myself I've gone through this process I
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
did it for the state of Maine
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
and we we had a textbook
 
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
and we we had a textbook
for

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
the Civics in the fourth grade
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
and because that was our where we taught
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
main studies and we had Civics and and
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
families you know knowing this 70
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
dollars you have this which you can
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
afford to spend and the kids learn that
 
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.710 align:start position:0%
afford to spend and the kids learn that
concept

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
then in the middle school there was a
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
not a textbook there was teacher's guide
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
with a lot of opportunity for activities
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
which should be pursued showing the
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
goals the objectives of the program
 
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:27.140 align:start position:0%
and where the resources were available
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
and then we did the same thing for
 
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:32.300 align:start position:0%
specific courses within the high school
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
for the lower grades there is only a
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
book for grades
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
two three and four and later on at the
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
upper end of the elementary school
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
so I I think that we need to really
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
filter through this and find out just
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
how this is going to be done and we
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
ought to have some input on that too
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
because there's nobody on this
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
you imagine
 
00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:01.220 align:start position:0%
that from the legislation
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
two members of the house okay one in the
 
00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:06.490 align:start position:0%
two members of the house okay one in the
Senate

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:06.500 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
so Rick yeah on the um on what you
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
started talking about on the the
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
hb2 page 18 of what what Jen just handed
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
out line eight for the purpose of
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
creating a New Hampshire Civics Tech
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
textbook to be distributed dot dot dot
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
um is is
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
part of the question here what that
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
means could could that be interpreted as
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
you know you know grade appropriate or
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
for um or skill appropriate
 
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.470 align:start position:0%
for um or skill appropriate
um

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh that could be you know
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
that that serves as a
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
serves as the curriculum used in in all
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a hard definition
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
of civics textbook to be distributed
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.530 align:start position:0%
here so
um

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
because I agree with what Senator Ward
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
was saying and what representative
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
cordelli was saying that that you know
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
what your uh what you're putting in
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
front of a fourth grader is you know
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
potentially quite different from what
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
it says to every New Hampshire Civics
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
classroom was that
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at it it's a Civics
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:48.260 align:start position:0%
well there's a required course in civics
 
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
the text so the print of copy will be in
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
each classroom but not necessarily to
 
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:08.180 align:start position:0%
each child that's how I see this
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
but I think the intent here
 
00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
was to create
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
an ongoing
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
really K-12 program
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
with varying varying components of it uh
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
that's age age specific
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
and so I mean you know for example I
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
remember I think somebody was talking
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
about like in in the lower elk grades
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
the mere fact of doing some
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative decision making
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
is part of a Civics initiative of how do
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
you make decisions how do you solve
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
problems that is that's a that's a
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's a component it's not a government
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
issue but it's a it's a dealing with the
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
Civility and the and and how do you
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
engage in decision making so I think I
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
would hope the commission would begin to
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
look at not just a textbook
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
but what kinds of activities and what
 
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:06.380 align:start position:0%
kinds of curriculum that's available
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the Spectrum uh depending
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
upon what the uh age level of the
 
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:14.780 align:start position:0%
student happens to be so every year
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
you're not just dealing with a fourth
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
grade program but every year there's
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be engaging
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
the students in some kind of a Civics
 
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.010 align:start position:0%
the students in some kind of a Civics
activity

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
well it says create a textbook and
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
related curriculum exactly right the
 
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
related curriculum I think that's what's
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I think the the whole issue of of
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
online stuff is important too because in
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
this in this program there's a lot of
 
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:47.660 align:start position:0%
video that's available
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
that could also be used that's not
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
printed material I'm not downgrading
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
printed material but uh with with how
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
youth today is so engaged in the video
 
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.510 align:start position:0%
youth today is so engaged in the video
world

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that that has got to
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
be part of an under a foundational piece
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
video of Martin Luther King's I Have A
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
Dreams Music right yeah
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have for example I I was sharing with
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
Martha Madsen now those of us that had
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
worked on the 18 year old vote we now
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
have a uh 55-minute video that basically
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
talks about how we how those of us that
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
were involved in this thing organized it
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
lobbied it and then engaged in the uh
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
the whole voter registration and I mean
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
I I think she's going to be using that
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
with her social studies groups and they
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
have their annual meeting in the fall so
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
I mean it's that kind of activity I
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.339 --> 00:51:55.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
I think that the primary thing I try to
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
achieve today I think I've done that is
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
that where it where our current language
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
came from it came from basically
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
from Ohio now um where we go I guess
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's up to that Commission
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
and I think one of your set one of the
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of the assessments will be
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
the next time when we hit the get the
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
curriculum going here you'll be able to
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
see whether or not there's an
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
improvement in the uh
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
results of the test scores on this
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
well that that goes to the the other
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
question I think I had listed there
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in that um
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
there's accountability
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
now how to measure Improvement and
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
assessment under 5A on the agenda is
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
that going to be locally developed or is
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
that going to be something which is
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
so I think something that's important to
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
reference on this too is the the Doe's
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
news release which you've got copied on
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
page three yeah
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and it it goes to say that uh
 
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:15.530 align:start position:0%
um and it it goes to say that uh
Nationwide

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
average scores declined in the uh in in
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
U.S history and Civics for eighth
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
graders compared to 2018 with Civic
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
scores declining for the first time
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
since the assessment began in 1998
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
and so this is specific to the 2022 nape
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's a lot going on in
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 2021 and 2022 uh nape uh you
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
know because of coven and
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
I think under would would one of the uh
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
objectives of the commission also be to
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
understand what
 
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.589 align:start position:0%
understand what
um

00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
what contributed to the decline in um
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
which which clearly
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
um bucks the trend
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
that of of improving improved results
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of assessment back
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
I mean was it curriculum was it covid
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
was it
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell from these nape
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
scores here I'd like to find out what's
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
going on in their own State yeah yeah
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
well I mean the the nape score is
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
tracked by track to the state too so we
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
could see how New Hampshire did on this
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
not just Nationwide averages
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the states never really been
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
in the business of an assessment for
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
social studies we haven't been doing
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that's been relegated to the local
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then we have well we're going to
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
assess the performance based upon the
 
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:11.180 align:start position:0%
immigration test
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
and and of course there's also within
 
00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:16.220 align:start position:0%
our statute the provision
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I even put that Statute
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
where there's a local local competency
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
see um
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think I may not have put that yeah
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
let's see wait a minute
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
as a component instruction or paragraph
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
one locally developed competency
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
assessment of the United States
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
government and Civics that includes but
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to
 
00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:53.870 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to
um

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
I've never seen any of those results
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh is it possible for this group
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
for us to even find out how we're doing
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
on that locally developed assessment and
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
what is their developed competency
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
assessment how that has that being done
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
in schools for I don't know if it's
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
is that local assessment uh sent on to
 
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.180 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's not specified in there it doesn't
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just the immigration that's
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
the immigration test but but not local
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
but we don't know how they're doing on
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
their local competency tests for social
 
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:50.809 align:start position:0%
their local competency tests for social
studies

00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
but if they take the immigration test
 
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
they don't also have to take the other
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
one so they may not true so that might
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
so it's either
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
we talked about local you talk about
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
local thin State when we talk about each
 
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.950 align:start position:0%
local thin State when we talk about each
municipality

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
each district each district yep it's
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:38.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
as part of the required High School
 
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.970 align:start position:0%
as part of the required High School
course

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
we're is it possible to find out how
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
students are doing
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
on that locally developed assessment
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
we we gave this authority to these
 
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
school districts when we said it's no
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
longer a Statewide assessment
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
that was back early on under uh Jenny
 
00:58:10.859 --> 00:58:12.530 align:start position:0%
that was back early on under uh Jenny
Berry

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
Berry
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
I have a meeting with with Melissa white
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
of the department on Wednesday so I
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
could ask her
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
about it at that point
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah whether they are familiar with this
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
or got any information provided to them
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
if not I'd even just like to see what
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
those locally developed assessments look
 
00:58:31.859 --> 00:58:33.290 align:start position:0%
those locally developed assessments look
like

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
I only see the results I just like to
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
see what they that'd be good for that
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
I think accountability is really
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
important we oftentimes put money into
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
we don't get the results whether it
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
is the committee's support of our put a
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
request into the department to see if
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
they can acquire if they don't have this
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
locally accepted locally developed
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
assessments so we can see them have them
 
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.569 align:start position:0%
assessments so we can see them have them
available

00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it I would yeah
 
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.490 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it I would yeah
okay

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
so we will ask that
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time finding the
 
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.250 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time finding the
civics

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
civics
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
nape data
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
state level and and I hear you speaking
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
about the nape data for civics is that
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
broken down by state I'm trying to it
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
must be yeah at least for other subjects
 
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure yeah but I'm just not
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
finding it on Civics yeah I've seen it
 
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:47.780 align:start position:0%
on on the other subjects
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
and and looking at the Department's you
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
know a more you know closer read of the
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
Department's Short news release here
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's referencing Nationwide Trends
 
01:00:02.049 --> 01:00:02.059 align:start position:0%
not which you know
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
which aren't necessarily reflective of
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
I can also be interesting to see if they
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
receive all these
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
reports from the school districts by
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
June 30.
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
we're right there
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's always an issue isn't it yeah
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably just like the uh emergency
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
no sense writing this stuff in the law
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
so so could we ask the department for um
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
for the for the Statewide
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
um so if those are available yeah yeah
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
Statewide Nate yeah or no no I'm sorry
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
not Statewide
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
um by by District yeah they'll ask for
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
the local tests yeah okay ask for the
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
state nape results right and ask for you
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
know the citizenship and Immigration
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
Services tab
 
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
so there's three things we're requesting
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
on out of this law in in as granular uh
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know we should be able to get it
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
right down to the I mean we don't need
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
Student data but we need um District
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.109 align:start position:0%
Student data but we need um District
data

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and if and if it can be
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
I mean the nape data on a national basis
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
is is also
 
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.670 align:start position:0%
is is also
um

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
categorized by uh what's the what's the
 
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.589 align:start position:0%
categorized by uh what's the what's the
term

01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:01:33.609 --> 01:01:33.619 align:start position:0%
um disaggregated
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
groups did I get that right yeah by like
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
different subgroups like so for yeah
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and if that's available yeah
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
looking at the back page
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
it has listed mental health under 2G
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay so that's listed as a component of
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
our health education program
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
not as a separate
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
my question is is that and we'll have to
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
know this because we have retained three
 
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:05.089 align:start position:0%
know this because we have retained three
bills

01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
are we going to go try to put this in
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
the area studies like we've done other
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
components of Health and Wellness or are
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
we going to insert it in as a
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
requirement of adequacy as a separate
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
because it diverges it from how we've
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
addressed it as a state in the past it's
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
been a component underneath
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I quite honestly
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
I don't have a clear understanding what
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
is mental
 
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.270 align:start position:0%
is mental
mental

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
mental
 
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
mental
um

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
I why I bring this up today I'm fearful
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
of one thing is when I was teaching as a
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
principal back in the 70s 80s 90s we had
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
an issue which was I think came to
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention ADHD
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
and what do we do with this attention
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
deficit disorder which is a hyperactive
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
for some of the kids were always on the
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
jig really moving around and all uh I I
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
had my own youngster like that and and
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
so what was the thing that the school
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
off time said put him on Ritalin yeah
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
we had so many kids on Ritalin
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
and Young Rick we found out later his IQ
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
is over 140. and this kid was
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
supercharged up here in the head and was
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know just very active and sometimes
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
very bored and and so I don't want to go
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
down the route of having
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
mental health being a
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
identified by folks which aren't
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
properly trained to do that the doctor
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
the psychologists maybe the school
 
01:05:45.059 --> 01:05:46.430 align:start position:0%
the psychologists maybe the school
counselor

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
um certainly I as a teacher was not
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
prepared to do that uh I often spoke to
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
special ed people because you start
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
getting at the area of of IEP
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
so we have within these bills
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
that desire on one of them is to have a
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health program I
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what quite that means I think
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
we retained because there was some
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
concern as definition whether it should
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
be placed into adequacy or put
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
underneath studies I agree there seems
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
to be issues going on in our schools
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
right now I hear from so many
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the field
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of discussion about
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
ADHD too
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
and that's where we went with that
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and we started prescribing things and
 
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:35.660 align:start position:0%
discussing things
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't think I had the expertise
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
to be discussing
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I I opened that up for a discussion
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
where we're going to go on it
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
I think that that you touched on special
 
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:52.220 align:start position:0%
education I think some of that
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health what
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
what aspects of mental health qualify
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
you for an IEP and special education
 
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:04.940 align:start position:0%
um the government just
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
defined HD HD as
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
um an issue that would qualify you for
 
01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:14.569 align:start position:0%
um an issue that would qualify you for
idea

01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
what other things
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
are we going down a path where maybe in
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
some cases where over
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
qualifying students for special
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
education over identifying students for
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
special education because of
 
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know maybe anxiety or something else
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
you know I that's something I'm
 
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
interested in also
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
I can remember my school psychologist I
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
had when I was a young principal back in
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
Gardner Maine
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
and in those days we were just coming
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
into idea
 
01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:54.170 align:start position:0%
into idea
and

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
we were talking about Behavior
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
those versed in emotional handicapping
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
condition and there there's a difference
 
01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.750 align:start position:0%
condition and there there's a difference
there

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
which is environment behavior Can
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
oftentimes be a result of something
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
negative going on at home or how the the
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
student is feeling and so you see
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
negative behaviors which are contrary to
 
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:21.020 align:start position:0%
what we want to see as the norm
 
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:24.380 align:start position:0%
but is that truly an IEP
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition I was told it
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
wasn't that it was something that could
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
be supported through
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
almost like a a plan to help that
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
particular child it didn't have to be
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
done through Special Ed I don't know
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
that I was even thinking of these builds
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
as as having to do with special
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
education or just more like kids being
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
able to identify how they're feeling and
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
and saying okay I'm feeling really
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
anxious today or or if it's okay to feel
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
like that if you're feeling it about
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
something or or I'm really sad and that
 
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know and being able to talk to
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
somebody about why am I feeling sad or
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
or I don't know if I if I was I did if I
 
01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:07.849 align:start position:0%
or I don't know if I if I was I did if I
was

01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
putting those bills in a special
 
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
education category I didn't see them as
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
as not necessarily special ed but is it
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's a part of adequacy or is it part of
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
Health which should be putting what you
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
got but change the statutory reference
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's I guess where where we put
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh studies is in the sheet right there
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
and that's where we're talking about
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
let's see which which one am I listening
 
01:09:38.699 --> 01:09:40.070 align:start position:0%
let's see which which one am I listening
here

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah the school board shall ensure
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
the health education physical education
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
to include importance of exercise and
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
wellness are taught the pupils as part
 
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.249 align:start position:0%
wellness are taught the pupils as part
of

01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:49.259 --> 01:09:49.849 align:start position:0%
of
um

01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
to include physiology hygiene Health
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships physical
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.709 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships physical
education

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
oppositional to put what you just
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
discussed in where we have the other
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
components of Health I I just don't want
 
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
to develop another
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
another category within the the
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
substantive criteria for an adequate
 
01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.209 align:start position:0%
substantive criteria for an adequate
education

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's I think where one of the bills
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
lays it out to be in that area
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
whereas it's more appropriate to stick
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
language that you're proposing over
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
underneath studies
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
189 10.
 
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.530 align:start position:0%
189 10.
so

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
um Rick I know we've we've um in fact
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
the the language in 189 10
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
shows amendments that were made over the
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
last I think couple of Cycles with the
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
um uh with interpersonal relationships
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the personal finance literacy
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and it also has things like
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
abuse of children human interactions I
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
think that would that have been maybe
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
AIDS but but but I think you know above
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
Romans 1 and 2 and 3 is Roman one
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
um which talks about the Department of
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
Education shall survey school districts
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
um biennially to receive reports on
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
compliance with this section
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I I don't know if this is
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
the whole section
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure compliance with Roman 2
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
and Roman 3.
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
and um do we have copies of those
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
reports from
 
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.390 align:start position:0%
reports from
prior

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
prior
biennium

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm sort of wondering if the study
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
isn't what students are studying but
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
what we're studying
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
how school districts are responding to
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
when I talked with uh
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
Anthony Anthony's no longer with us
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
um he's retired he he said that we are
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
we haven't really defined what that
 
01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:06.500 align:start position:0%
category 189 verse 193 right
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
are we sometimes we're loading up one
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
when we shouldn't be loading up that
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
when we should be loading the other one
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
up and really clarify ourselves as to
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
where we want to put these concentrated
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
studies that are within these criteria
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are not identified in 193 where
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
should we put those
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and he was always suggesting to me
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
Pullman 189 that's where we need to list
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
this stuff seeing that you have in your
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
rules where mental health is part of
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
your health right and so you've you've
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
got you've under 193e you've got seven
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
which is health and wellness and 10
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
which is personal financial literacy so
 
01:12:47.689 --> 01:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
those correspond to Roman 2 and Roman
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
three of one that 189 10 and 2 and 3
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
clearly build out what it's what is
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
meant by health and what is meant by
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
personal financial literacy
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so maybe it's a maybe it's a good
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
place to provide greater
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know detail
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
on what the legislator legislature is
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
looking for and also to get a um to get
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
a report
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
do you know in you're looking at 8306
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
rules because that's where all this
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
stuff that we're looking at here appears
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the 300 series
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
are these areas which specify like I
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
pointed on the back side of that sheet
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
where it talks about alcohol and drug
 
01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
injury prevention nutrition physical
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
activity Family Life tobacco mental
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
health Etc are those being scratched
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
from the new proposed rules
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
is that the Gap Elements which are
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's the Gap that uh the school
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
boards Association addressed
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
it maybe I yeah among other things I
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
think we got to be careful because if
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're losing it here then we've got to
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
make sure it's somewhere else
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
and we we ought to be putting it
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
underneath where we have all the rest of
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the health stuff and really load up the
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
health section and do it properly
 
01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.770 align:start position:0%
health section and do it properly
um

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
what's included within health and
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
wellness yeah so so could we actually
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
could we ask the department for the um
 
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:18.260 align:start position:0%
for maybe the last
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
that this section requires
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
the department has a whole department of
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
of Health and Wellness that should have
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
all of this and and I our school
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
district's supposed to be doing
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
something with mt SSB however they want
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do it I know Manchester has two
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
directors of Mt SSB but I actually don't
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
even know what they what they do right
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I know they have them so I I I think
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
there's something going on everywhere
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
but we just don't know what it is but I
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think the department there is is
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
pretty much on top of that because I've
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
spoken to somebody there before and she
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
knew everything that was going on
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
in all the different places and I can't
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
remember would you know I can't remember
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
or they might not okay I'd go uh Dave
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know it says at the top the
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
department shell surveys School District
 
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.410 align:start position:0%
department shell surveys School District
biannually

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
biannually
 
01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.250 align:start position:0%
biannually
um

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'd go back 10 years oh I'm and so we
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
get five reports and so you go back
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
prior to covid
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
and so your your reports were gonna
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to say well that's just
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
related to covet uh let's let's go back
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
as far as we can get well I absolutely
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
agree yeah yeah I think my concern is
 
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.750 align:start position:0%
agree yeah yeah I think my concern is
that

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think the interest in this area
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
has been spiked
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
as you've come out of covert
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
as we begin to see that there are a lot
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
of students
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
who are still reacting
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
to their isolation during that period of
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
time I mean we've done a lot of good
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
work in the state dealing with special
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
ed special ed referrals Etc
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is not my interest in this area
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
because I do think there's a new
 
01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.490 align:start position:0%
because I do think there's a new
interest

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
that deals with how are we dealing with
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
students who are struggling because I
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
mean we heard reports of
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
the lack of maturation on the part of
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
some students that like 8th graders are
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
really behaving at a sixth grade access
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
grade level
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
and so my concern is what are the
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
support systems in trying to ramp up I
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
mean how long I don't know the answer to
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
this question how long does it take a
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
student or a young person who has been
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
disen who's been disengaged from a
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
social interactions with students where
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
they are would ordinarily have been
 
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.770 align:start position:0%
they are would ordinarily have been
maturing

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
maturing
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
didn't during that two period two-year
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
period of Time how long does it take and
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
what does it take to get them up to I
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to say grade level but up to their
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
age level if you may that they're
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
behaving in a way that that they should
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
be behaving and I that so as I look at
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
this area here notwithstanding what
 
01:17:37.209 --> 01:17:37.219 align:start position:0%
we've talked about as far as reports Etc
 
01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:39.980 align:start position:0%
what are the systems that are in place
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
or need to be in place in school
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
districts to expedite
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
the students maturation to their age
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
level I guess that's a way to put it so
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
that that really is my concern as I look
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
at this and that's not necessarily
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
what's the curriculum that's going to do
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
it but what are the experiences that
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
would help them expedite their
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
maturation so that's that's kind of
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
well if we get if we get any reports
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
that they have going back at least can
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
you give us an idea yeah that will give
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
us some basic information which is
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.850 align:start position:0%
us some basic information which is
necessary

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.810 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to kind of believe that you
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
know in my discussions with our
 
01:18:32.689 --> 01:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
superintendent we're on other health
 
01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:36.860 align:start position:0%
impaired category IP has grown
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
I just by
 
01:18:40.199 --> 01:18:42.310 align:start position:0%
I just by
observing

01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
observing
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
students there there's there's there is
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
there's a change I'm great I watched a
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
graduation at the elementary school it
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
was a k through eight just the other
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
night and and I watched it the previous
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
year too
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
there was a different field this year
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
because I think what's Just Happening
 
01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're seeing some of that catch up
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
happening and developing
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
um and I do believe that teachers
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
working real hard to try and get that
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
to that level I see it I saw it with
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
their band and choral program it was
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
really just outstanding and it was
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
and of course you ever you know as a
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
teacher every three years you get a crop
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
of kids or maybe are not the ones that
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
you think are exemplary and that happens
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's been going on for
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
years yeah
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
I used to have teachers who used to like
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
take that one year to go out and get
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
some training on the year that could
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
happen was coming through
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
um so I I agree I think we need to have
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
mental health as part of and notice
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere underneath our health and
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
wellness program but I say it like that
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
not as a separate program I think by
 
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
saying it separately I think
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
it may get us into some territory we
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into is the teacher
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
now responsible for mental health as I
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
perceive it and as I Define it versus
 
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
how you see it Dave and how you define
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
it they may be different but clearly
 
01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's part of Health yeah it's clearly
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of I mean physical health and
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
mental health yeah yeah can provides
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
Health yeah yeah it's just like within
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the social studies we talk about we have
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
geography every history of government
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
you have Civics those are elements
 
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.070 align:start position:0%
you have Civics those are elements
within

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
I I I I guess I'm cautious in saying
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps we shouldn't try to keep these
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
individual elements as a separate entity
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
in itself as just trying to do like we
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
did we still call it social studies but
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
we have parentheses out beside it what
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
are those elements within that's what we
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
should be doing
 
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I think using the word sometimes
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
mental throws everything off
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
um because it's not so much mental
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
health it's your overall good health
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's part of that so I think when we say
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
mental health we immediately think of
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know identifying kids or them having
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
to go for whatever and that and that's
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
not necessary it's not necessarily that
 
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's just you know just good health
 
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.669 align:start position:0%
it's it's just you know just good health
overall

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
health and wellness health and wellness
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
describes it pretty well but but but
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
just just using those words alone I
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
don't think does because because I think
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
traditionally we've we've looked at
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
Health as being a physical thing I mean
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
when you look at health insurance
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
um it it only up until recently has it
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
has it really started to look at Health
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
above the neck and and uh and in many
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
cases it still doesn't include you know
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
teeth or eyes or stuff like that I mean
 
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like everything the neck
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
and blow was was well understood and we
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
have hospitals and doctors and things
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
but pretty much from the neck above
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
you're on your own at least had been for
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
a long time and um and so I think as as
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
as we we understand that mental health
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
is so important to to your overall
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
health including yeah I think the way
 
01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:21.020 align:start position:0%
they had it and
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
306 or whatever part this is 300
 
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
306 or whatever part this is 300
306.40

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
they have mental health listed as part
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the K-12
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's a component of it's like a chapter
 
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
it's a component of it's like a chapter
Within

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
Within
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
and only it's it's
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
it transcends all the chapters uh so I
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
think that we I'd like to see us hold to
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
the way we've been doing it but
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into and even if we feel
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
necessary I'm I can support it to even
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
list it underneath the the studies where
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
we have health and wellness listed we we
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
can put this this component Define it
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
right a little bit there uh rather than
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
putting it as a new section of an
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education I think that's where
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a lot of reverse on
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think I think and and I
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
think you know building it out the way
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
you've got it and the way it is in in
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
the 306 is where it does yeah um you
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
know specifically column maybe you know
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
it does specifically mention mental
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
health but maybe with a little bit more
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
detail uh behind it uh you know as this
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which are guidance to our
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
school districts anymore
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the rules are the only place people
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
can walk to right now and see some of
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
these elements within these those
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
subject subject areas if we take it out
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
of 306
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be anything right
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
right and and and something that I
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
think's you know directly related to to
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
G and I'm not an expert in this so I'm
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm this you know this is hopefully it's
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat correct is there's been a lot
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
of discussion
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
certainly when I was on a school board
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
but I think we've had discussion around
 
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
this committee too in terms of adverse
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences and how that
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
contributes to to mental health and
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably having some language in there
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know speaks to the importance of
 
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.850 align:start position:0%
you know speaks to the importance of
understanding

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
what what those are
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know and how that's impacted a
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
student and
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I I've gone through that
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
with my own grandkids sure sometimes you
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
say suck it up but they don't if that's
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
a real hard thing for a kid do when
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
they're being throttled every day right
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think this is a very important topic
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to you know throw it aside
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing that I'm just trying to
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
make sure we do it properly so when we
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
when we do talk about
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
um this in Greater detail could we could
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
we get some folks in from maybe Holly
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe even consult with Senator Whitley
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get some suku School
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
psychologists in here and counselors in
 
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:27.860 align:start position:0%
here too and and a nurse
 
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:30.980 align:start position:0%
you're a nurse
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
a pediatric nurse yeah right we can have
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the person who just got the school nurse
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
of the Year award
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's important as well if
 
01:25:42.169 --> 01:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
there's someone at the department too
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's running the yeah I'd like them to
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
tell us what's going on they they know
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on Statewide she sent me a
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
chart it was it actually was going out
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
here or do we want to do that in the
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which we're going to be
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
putting together that's right that's my
 
01:25:56.639 --> 01:25:58.370 align:start position:0%
putting together that's right that's my
question

01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
what I try to do is just get some
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
clarification here and I think I've
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
gotten that that the direction we ought
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
to take today that's given the direction
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
which we can give the subcommittee
 
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.169 align:start position:0%
which we can give the subcommittee
exactly

01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we shouldn't be duplicating there
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
paying three bills dealing with mental
 
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
health so we could get a better bead of
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes for 306 change that
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
say the school board may require so they
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
could leave it out if they want to if
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
that'd be on a side by side where Fred
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
comes here I think we can address all
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
this stuff I have a question
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
um we just talked about getting reports
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
on the last 10 years and you pointed out
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
that that was biennials there'll be five
 
01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.770 align:start position:0%
that that was biennials there'll be five
reports

01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
but then it says here on the third
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
sentence that the report
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
shall be sent to the president of the
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Speaker of the House of
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
Representative chairpersons of the
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
Senate and House committees with
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional education so did Rick did
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
you ever get a report on this
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
I can honestly say yay or nay on that I
 
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
do get reports I got the bullying report
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
I got the suspension expulsion report
 
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:29.090 align:start position:0%
I got the suspension expulsion report
um

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
see they oftentimes come in in the
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
summertime and they walk in this line
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
your desk there and so
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
he oftentimes
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
have to request them again okay and so I
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
think that's what we need to do we need
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
to request and get a mail did you ever
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
get up
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
long time ago that's a long time ago
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
that's right exactly right it's not
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
something that is sent on a regular
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
basis that we all know about
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
they they do send reports to us
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they come in during the
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
summer months and it's just left on a
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
desk and then what happens is that
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
change in leadership change in party
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
different chairs and and so okay that
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
all happens okay
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
so if they're a staff we should be able
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
to get copies done yeah that's right it
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
should be available we will find that
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
out that was my question yeah we will
 
01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
find out
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
reports that come here should also go to
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
the study committee yes yes yes we'll
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
direct them of course everybody will get
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
a copy of everything we get coming back
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
to us here
 
01:28:34.679 --> 01:28:35.870 align:start position:0%
to us here
so

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on on
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
this topic
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.669 align:start position:0%
