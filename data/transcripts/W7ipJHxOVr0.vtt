trading and I understand that Financial
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
Services is one of the most heavily
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
regulated industries that we have so I'm
 
00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
very familiar with some of the rules and
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%

enough alcohol issues
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%

development committee uh which I found

very interesting but I came here to uh
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh have a hearing on a bill for a

constituent and I listened to many

people before me and many people after
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
me as I stayed here to listen and I
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
thought Commerce is a really interesting
 
00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:16.459 align:start position:0%
place to be and a lot of my background
 
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.100 align:start position:0%
touches on all these different sectors
 
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:22.700 align:start position:0%
and I was also a human resource
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
assistant so that brings insurance and
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and all those types of things
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%

forward to working with everybody here
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
for this committee thank you
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I am John Hunt I have uh was first
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
elected in 1986.
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
my very first term was Science and
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
Technology because uh the time Harold
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
Burns thought that uh that committee
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
should get involved in computer
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
technology and I was an apple IBM dealer
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
um that again is my past life in terms
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
of computer retail in more present time
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes I have been serving on this
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee ever since then except I did
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
have one brief term where I was given a
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
a reprieve from Commerce if you want to
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
call that but I I was sent off to the
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hindu lands called legislative
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
and and uh actually Paul Smith was my
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
clerk back way back then so in this more
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
recent is you will uh the rumor is true
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
I do live in a castle and uh and yes it
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
is true that you can rent it at eighteen
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a night plus the
 
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:27.260 align:start position:0%
wonderful New Hampshire meals tax
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I do have some interested in vacation
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
rental issues having said that I would
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
say that this committee when I first got
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
on it it was uh actually the history of
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
the community was just Banks it was
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
Banks and then
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
by the time I got here was Insurance
 
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
um I think George russos was just left
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
being Deputy Deputy insurance
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the time and and uh so
 
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.509 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the time and and uh so
um

00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
it was you know kind of a boring
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee but the reason why I wanted to
 
00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
get on Commerce Way Back Then it was
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
Interstate banking issue and and they
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
seemed like they had ever receptions
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
every week and and that was a real odd
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue every lobbyist was registered on
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
one side or the other and I said well
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is that's a committee that's got
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
some exciting things happening there
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
um but then uh my my tenure is that I
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
made it even more exciting and that is
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh later in not so much later but I um I
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
passed the uniform trust code uh and uh
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then the speakers then decide that
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
all the trust legislation shouldn't go
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
to Judiciary it should come to Commerce
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
because uh clearly I knew something
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
about trust as someone who has some and
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
then uh the was uh direct shipping a
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
bank a bill a liquor I was in the beer
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
of the month club and I was being cut
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
off by ups and I said what do you mean
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know well we don't think we don't
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
think it's legal to deliver to you and I
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
said well show me the law well there was
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
no law but we made sure there was a law
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
and so once we uh got direct shipping
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
and then um I also did self-distribute
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
for beer distributors all of a sudden
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
they decided that we uh Commerce should
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
get all the liquor bills and that's why
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
we have them here and so I I take a lot
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
of responsibility for why all these
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
different issues that you will see come
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
to this committee
 
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.689 align:start position:0%
to this committee
um

00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
in theory you know the Commerce is
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
almost everything you know Commerce can
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
be anything but uh they're obviously
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
there are other committees have a little
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
more focus on whatever type of issues
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
they have so we are sort of a catch-all
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
um the most famous bill that got me uh
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
moving up the ladder was indoor smoking
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
I was the one who wrote changed the law
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
and indoor smoking from uh you know
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
looking for non-smoking to turn it out
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire was you can only go
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
smoke in designated uh smoking areas and
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh so since then I've uh have served as
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
chair starting took me took me five
 
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:11.540 align:start position:0%
terms before I finally got to be a chair
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of people here who just
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
hung around long enough that they had
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
more seniority but then since then I
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
have chaired and then I have been the
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
ranking minority most of the time so uh
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
I am open to always new suggestions new
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
ideas but it is true that a former
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
lobbyist once said that I was Carmen the
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
Magnificent that I will I will give you
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
the answer before I even heard the
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
question that that some people would say
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
that you can oh you'll once you get to
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
know me you'll get to say is you'll
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
pretty much know where I stand on almost
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
any issues simply because I've been
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
doing this for so long that I'm pretty
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
consistent and I and I do pride myself
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
on being consistent so
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Keith Ammon this is
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
my fourth term and Lisa post and I share
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
a district it's Hillsborough 42. so that
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
again is New Boston Mount Vernon and
 
00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:13.329 align:start position:0%

lineborough

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:13.339 align:start position:0%
lineborough
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
I was Clerk of this committee last term
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
so I learned a lot writing a lot of
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
notes before that I was on Science and
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
Tech Municipal and County so I had a
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
little bit of a varied experience in my
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
early 20s I got some exposure to
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
corporate finance that didn't last very
 
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.140 align:start position:0%
long I went into a pharmaceutical
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
I.T development and so that's what most
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
of my career has been spent on so uh
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
developing projects that have to do with
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of data
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh about 10 years ago I got interested
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
in blockchain so I was on the governor's
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
blockchain commission that just wrapped
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
up in December so we'll have some things
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
to talk about with that
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
my wife has worked for I think four
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
different insurance companies and I have
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
a life insurance policy with each one I
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
think that's her master plan
 
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:02.830 align:start position:0%
think that's her master plan
um

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
so uh at least I have an expert at home
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
when I need to have an insurance
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%

glad to be back I I've had a varied I've
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
done various things in my career I was
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
in high tech for many years focusing on
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
marketing and operations and
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
um I had a catering company for a number
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
of years and I now work my husband for a
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
national Healthcare consulting company
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
that is was um started by my husband so
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
I work for my husband
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
um let's see what else I can tell you
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm really glad that we're
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
equal in this committee I think it's
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
going to really change the Dynamics here
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think we'll work closely together to
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
get a lot of good work done and I'm
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
really glad that we're alternating so
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
that we get to know people from there
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have to say I just noticed
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh how all women on one side and Men on
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the other so I am going to I will be
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
shuffling shuffling the seats so we're
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
not we're not locked into this
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
configuration because this is no good
 
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay okay still better so um let's see
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
what else I was going to say yeah I mean
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be a really good
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
year I'm looking forward to it and I
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
guess the only other thing is
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm the ranking minority leader so uh
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
Dems caucus it in case I don't get to
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
say it caucus at whenever we break here
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
upstairs it's either in 403 404 or 405
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
we'll figure it out
 
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.350 align:start position:0%
we'll figure it out
okay

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
John I hadn't noticed uh I'm sorry when
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
I came in I was going to sit with the uh
 
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:48.740 align:start position:0%
with the women
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
but I did I didn't recognize that you
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
had actually set up the room in such a
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
way and that was a mistake so I'm glad
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
that I'm where I'm supposed to be now
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you'll get to stay there yes
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
it just decides yeah the Freshman I have
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
to sort uh Paul Terry I am a second term
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
rep from Alton and Barnstead in Belknap
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
County this is my second term on
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
Commerce as a freshman I did not select
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
Commerce in consumer affairs as my as my
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
first choice it was my third choice but
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake because this is the
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
model house committee and I can say that
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
with a great degree of knowledge and
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
confidence having been here for for two
 
00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:39.049 align:start position:0%
confidence having been here for for two
years

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so it's good to be back on a Commerce
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs and that I was not
 
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:44.450 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs and that I was not
um

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
uh traded to another committee shall we
 
00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
uh traded to another committee shall we
say

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
I really learned a lot the first two
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
years and it was really enjoyable
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
this past December I celebrated my 45th
 
00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.470 align:start position:0%
this past December I celebrated my 45th
anniversary

00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
anniversary
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
as an ordained minister of word and
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
and largest Protestant denominations
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I am officially honorably retired
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
from active service although from time
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
to time I still have an opportunity to
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
uh to perform some ministerial duties
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's a good thing that I'm on
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce and consumer affairs because I
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
really am acquainted with a number of
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
the areas of of concern that have been
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
assigned to this particular committee
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%

lucrative as it is doesn't pay quite
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
enough to survive so I I do some I do
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you all
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
and we're almost ready at the time yeah
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
so just a couple things
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
um as you probably noticed there's a lot
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
of folks here visiting us and all of
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
these people will you will get to uh to
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
know because each one of them is someone
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
who uh will Lobby this committee on
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
various different issues and I I in past
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
years I used to schedule a time for it
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh but it will as time goes I'll
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
I'll let them speak so but but since
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're we have the insurance department
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
here I probably will start right in with
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and then
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
afterwards those those lobbyists who
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
represent different Insurance Industries
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'll invite them to speak or introduce
 
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.330 align:start position:0%
I'll invite them to speak or introduce
themselves

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
um so as you probably all noticed that
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
some phones went off and this committee
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
is the committee that created the five
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
dollar rule and
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm cutting the slack today
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
because you know you can't tell somebody
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
a rule until after the after they had an
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be told about it uh we
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
used to have a sign it would say right
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
it'd be up front there if you know if
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
your if your cell phone goes off
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
um you owe five dollars to the coffee
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
fund so my recommendation to you all is
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
that when you walk in the building and
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
you sign in for mileage then you pull
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
your phone out and put it on silent and
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
that way if you get into that habit you
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
no I I understand that you know we we
 
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
all have our first day
 
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.850 align:start position:0%
all have our first day
[Laughter]

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:48.860 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
okay so we start off with the New
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department and uh I
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
would say that we uh this is the
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
insurance committee uh we do all
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance except workers comp
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
workers comp is for the labor committee
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and uh but I have been invited every
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
once in a while to participate in
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
workers comp issues mainly because
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
usually the speaker appointed appointed
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
forgot that I don't do workers comp but
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh but that might be helpful in it but
 
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.470 align:start position:0%
uh but that might be helpful in it but
otherwise

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
Department about any insurance issue
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
the slide deck will roughly approximate
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
What DJ and I are going to talk about
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
today first off the mission of the
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh is to promote
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
good by ensuring the existence of a
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
state safe and competitive Insurance
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and we do that through the
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
development and enforcement of New
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance laws
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
and we're committed to doing that in an
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
honest effective and timely manner a
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
little bit of background about me my
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
name is Chris I've been commissioner
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
since February of 2020 so just to go
 
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:10.580 align:start position:0%
back and think back to the week before
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
covid shutdowns happened and that's when
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
I took the helm at the insurance
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
department it's been an interesting 30
 
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:18.500 align:start position:0%
odd months
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
prior to spending prior to being
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
nominated as insurance commissioner I
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
spent five years as the president and
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
CEO of a Statewide trade Association for
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
Independent Insurance Agents New
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of insurance
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
agents and prior to that I spent most of
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
my career and the private practice of
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
law including some legislative work here
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Church department has
 
00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:44.179 align:start position:0%
85 full-time staff positions as of today
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
75 odd of those are filled and we're
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
always looking to fill the the holes in
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
um but it's natural in this time to have
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
some openings uh New Hampshire
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
Department was established back in 1851
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
in fact it was the first state insurance
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
department in the nation we have that
 
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.029 align:start position:0%
department in the nation we have that
distinction

00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
and the statutes that we uh that we
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
regulate run from RSA 400 through RSA
 
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
um besides uh regulating the insurance
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
industry we're also responsible for
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
collecting premium taxes fees and the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
regulation of insurance companies
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
producers uh and adjusters last year
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
2022 the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
department collected general fund
 
00:32:29.889 --> 00:32:29.899 align:start position:0%
revenue of
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
154 million nine hundred thousand
 
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.850 align:start position:0%
154 million nine hundred thousand
dollars

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:33.860 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
135 million of that came from the
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
premium tax which is a sales tax on
 
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
insurance policies uh 20 million of that
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
came primarily from licensing fees for
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
the uh folks licensed here in New
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's some administrative
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
fines probably about a plus or minus uh
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
one one million dollars
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire Insurance
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
Department's administrative costs are
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
covered by an administrative assessment
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire licensed insurance
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
companies and so there's no general fund
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
a revenue that goes to support the
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
insurance department the industries that
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
we regulate pay for us
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there are nearly 200
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
000 Insurance licensees and that's
 
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
000 Insurance licensees and that's
because

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
um anybody no matter where they are in
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
the nation uh working for a National
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
Insurance Company if they're going to
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
potentially have an interaction with a
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumer either to deal
 
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
with a claim or to deal with the sale of
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
a policy they must have a license and so
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
though there are probably seven or eight
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
thousand licensees that are domestic
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
that live here in New Hampshire and sell
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
insurance to our members uh the other 96
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
percent are in other states they're
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
Manning call centers where we hear our
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
daily tv ads on you know in 15 minutes
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
you can save 15 or more those folks so
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's nearly 200 000 licensees that we
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
administer here on our team and believe
 
00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:58.700 align:start position:0%
it or not only three staff members
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
manage the renewals of all of those
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
people almost 20 million dollars in
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
state revenue
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
other things that we do at the
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
department is we provide Financial
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
examinations of every licensed insurance
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
company license in New Hampshire and
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we're looking for is to
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
ensure that those companies remain
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
solvent that they're charging enough
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
premium to pay the claims that they're
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
committed to paying that they have
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
enough in reserves and adequate reserves
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
so that they can continue to meet their
 
00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:28.570 align:start position:0%
so that they can continue to meet their
obligations

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:28.580 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
each each every five years we go through
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
a financial analysis review from the
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
NAIC DJ I'll talk about that in a minute
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our team is doing that
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
adequately we've passed with flying
 
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
colors uh the last two versions
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
our department also conducts Market
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
conduct exams for regulated entities and
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
some of those are targeted you know we
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
have a Consumer complaint that gets us
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
curious about whether or not a company's
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
complying with our law and we'll send
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
our investigators in to look
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
specifically at a potential violation of
 
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and other ones are are
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
just random that we go in and make sure
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
they're complying with our claim
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
settlement Practices Act we go and look
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
at 100 or so claim files and determine
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
if they're meeting both our state laws
 
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh federal laws and are being fair to
 
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.569 align:start position:0%
uh federal laws and are being fair to
Consumers

00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
we have a team that investigates and
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
prosecutes insurance fraud we have an
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
division of three folks that ensures
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
that our license sees those 200
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
000 licensees are complying with our
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
state law our disclosing required

potential criminal acts against them
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints against them so that
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%

I think DJ's going to talk about some of
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
previous life I sat on your side of the
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
table here and I will say that I was
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
always much more comfortable being where

protection we have a dedicated team of
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
issue come up
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
we receive approximately 5 000 calls a
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
year into the department the good news
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
is is that two-thirds of those calls are
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
people who are simply looking for
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
information they are people who
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately have had something
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunate occur they've got to go to
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
the doctor they've been in a car
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
accident they're trying to locate a life
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and so now they're
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
going through their policy they're in a
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
moment of stress and they're trying to
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
understand what all of these technical
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
terms mean for them
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so we're a resource for that uh you
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
know the other quarter of the complaints
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
that come in do turn into formal
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
investigations the company has
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
mishandled a claim or has engaged in
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
some other activity that is not
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with New Hampshire law and in
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
those cases as the commissioner
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have resources to go into
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
not only address the issue that the
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
consumer is going through but ensuring
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
that that issue is not part of a broader
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
Trend within that company
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
so we're very very proud of that team
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
just last week we put out a press
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
release that captured some of the
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
accomplishments of our consumer Division
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
and I won't go through it all but I do
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
want to brag on them just a little bit
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
so during 2022 the consumer services
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
unit processed
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
929 Consumer complaint investigations
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
over 4 000 assistant requests and 90
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
applications for external Health review
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and what that equals in terms of
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
consumer recovery is that we collected
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
an unprecedented 4.1 million dollars for
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers which eclipse
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the 2021 recovery by over 2.8 million
 
00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:23.900 align:start position:0%
dollars so obviously that is real money
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
by any measure and we're very proud that
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
we performed that service for granite
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
Staters the only thing that we ask
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
consumers have to have helped them is to
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
Simply tell other people that we are
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
here that we are a resource and that we
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
are available to help them so as you are
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
traveling throughout your districts if
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
you have a constituent that's having an
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
issue as the commissioner mentioned
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
please give us a call we have a team
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
that can Dive Right In and try to get to
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
it in as timely a manner as humanly
 
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.329 align:start position:0%
it in as timely a manner as humanly
possible

00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
additionally as the commissioner
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we do provide
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
expertise we are a resource to the
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislature as the commissioner
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a team of
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
approximately three to five people that
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see here on a consistent basis
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
our approach is that we defer to our
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts when coming to
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
testify before the legislature it's not
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
going to be just the Chris and DJ show
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
you may see us from time to time but we
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
have bona fide subject matter experts
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
throughout our department that Focus
 
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.130 align:start position:0%
throughout our department that Focus
specifically

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
in particular areas of insurance and so
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
whatever legislation is coming before
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
you you should have confidence that the
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
individual who's testifying on behalf of
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
this department is an expert and they
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about and if
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
they can't give you the answer that
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for immediately they will
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
get it to you in very very short order
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
Sarah is the enforcer over there she's
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
another resource for you but she makes
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
sure that we are on the straight and
 
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.329 align:start position:0%
sure that we are on the straight and
narrow

00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh as the commissioner mentioned we
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
collect premium taxes when we do have an
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
issue where an enforcement action must
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
be taken we handle the penalties and
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
fees that go into the general fund
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
we also participate in the National
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
or NAIC
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
to kind of summarize NAIC it's important
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
to remember that throughout the history
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
of our country insurance regulation has
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
been predominantly a state function and
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
we're very very proud of that in the
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
NAIC is a group of the 50 state
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as well as seven eight
 
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.349 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as well as seven eight
territories

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
territories
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
seven territories uh and we work as a
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
team we work as a team uh for a number
 
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:44.339 align:start position:0%
of different reasons
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the first instance they make tools
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
available to us that ensure 50 state
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
coordination in things like what's going
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
on in the industry so we have a
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
state-based system by which when we have
 
00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
a Consumer complaint come in it goes
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
into that system it allows us to track
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a particular Trend in
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but more importantly it
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
also sees if there is a trend going on
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the country or in other
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
states and so this way there we can say
 
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.150 align:start position:0%
states and so this way there we can say
okay

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh is this particular company just
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
missing the ball in a New Hampshire
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
issue or is this a corporate level
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
decision that seems to be running a foul
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
of a number of different states uh
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
regulations and in in those instances
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
where it is a broader Trend we have
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
resources within our uh counterparts
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the country to call them and
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
say do you have a better idea of what's
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
going on here how have you handled this
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
what approach did you take to help these
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
companies come into compliance with our
 
00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:43.310 align:start position:0%
companies come into compliance with our
regulations

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
the other big highlight for neic is that
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
we get together and we develop model
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
laws to promote consistency from state
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
to state it's a business friendly
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
approach we understand that for
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
companies it can be a real challenge to
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
get to know each of the 50 states
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
particular nuances within its laws and
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
we of course have our unique features in
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law but we do try to make
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
that as uniform as we possibly can again
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
for ease of use for not only the
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
companies but also for the consumers
 
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.670 align:start position:0%
companies but also for the consumers
themselves

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned we'll be providing
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise to you I've
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
covered that slide
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
and so I think with that I'll turn it
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's first day back I'll get used to the
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
microphone uh in New Hampshire it's a
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
couple important facts for you to
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate and understand we have 57
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
domestic insurance companies that means
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
those are companies that are licensed
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
here is New Hampshire being their
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
primary home for those companies we take
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
a we take the lead in all the financial
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
and compliance reviews making sure that
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
their financial adequacies uh financial
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
statements are adequate
 
00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:57.619 align:start position:0%
uh there are also
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
1131 other companies of foreign
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
companies uh licensed to sell insurance
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
here those are domesticated somewhere
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
else in the nation
 
00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
we do uh ongoing Financial exams of all
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
those companies every five years if
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
they're doing business in New Hampshire
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
we participate in the financial review
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
teams a couple of the divisions that we
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about is on both our life
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
and health side and our PNC side we have
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
folks that review each and every filing
 
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
and so that looks like you know when you
 
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
get your homeowners policy in the mail
 
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:32.780 align:start position:0%
or your health policy in the mail
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
somebody on our team has viewed each and
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
every sentence of those documents to
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
make sure they comply with New Hampshire
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
law if if applicable federal law and
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
that the uh guidance and outlines within
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
those policies are fair to Consumers and
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
so we have a team a
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
if they're not here so I can admit it
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
the most boring job in our department
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
that all day long all they do is review
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
these these forms and we have laws that
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
govern how most of them should be
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
drafted and when a policy decision needs
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
to be made we have a meeting to talk
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
about what the impacts of a language or
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
the market changing
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
oh we do the same thing for every rate
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
filing when an insurance company files
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
new rates here in New Hampshire we have
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
an actuary who will review that uh file
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
who will look at the assumptions within
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
that filing we'll look at the factors
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
that they're using to rate that filing
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
and determine that they're done in a
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory way done in
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
compliance with our law that both
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
charges an adequate premium but not
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
excessive premium you know we don't we
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
have a you know we have a an interest in
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that companies don't just buy
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
the market come here and charge a
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
premium that's lower than they need to
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
pay claims just to to grow market share
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
and our team does that uh particularly
 
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.130 align:start position:0%
and our team does that uh particularly
well

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
I think there are a couple things that I
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
just want to follow up on on things that
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
DJ talked about and he mentioned the 900
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints that we review each
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
year I think it's important for you to
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
understand how important uh those 900
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
complaints are to DJ and I and so when
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
our team reviews and processes those
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
complaints and helps consumers get to an
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
end result not one of those complaints
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
can be closed without a meeting where DJ
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I are present to go through what the
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
facts were what the complaint was the
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
company's response our interpretation of
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
the complaint in the company's response
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the final outcome so that we're
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that in every case we have the
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
best minds and us I won't admit I won't
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
for a second imagine that we're the best
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
minds but that we all understand what's
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
happening in the marketplace and so each
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
week we go through all of those uh so
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
that everybody knows that uh what's
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
happening out there and when there's
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be fixed then
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that we're requesting
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
and demanding that be fixed so nothing
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
slips through the cracks
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand how
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
big the insurance Marketplace is in New
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as compared to the nation in
 
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we write about .4 of a
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
percent so a little less than half a
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
percent of the nation's insurance is
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
written here in New Hampshire I think
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies aren't sitting in
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
New York or in in Hartford saying what
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
we really need to do is to break into
 
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:20.099 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Marketplace
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know in New Hampshire we've we've
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
long taken in this committee and the
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
legislature has long taken a free market
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
approach to regulating insurance we want
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
people to sell insurance here in New
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's a good place to
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
sell insurance a good place to do
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
business and we do that in in large part
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
without getting getting into nitty-bitty
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
regulation on how they do it we have a
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
super competitive Marketplace here when
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
you look at our Auto rates they're in
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
the 10 lowest in the nation despite the
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
fact that we have nicer than average
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
cars worse than average weather
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and no mandated auto insurance that's
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
not an accident that's because of what
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
you've all chosen to do year in and year
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
out we could say the same about our
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
health our individual health plan costs
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes when one of the 10 experts
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
that we talked about uh comes in to
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
speak to you or to any other legislative
 
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:14.579 align:start position:0%
committee they'll start with the
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
department has no formal opinion on this
 
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.849 align:start position:0%
department has no formal opinion on this
bill

00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
and then they'll have 10 talking points
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
that might sound very much like there's
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of concern here or a lot of good
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and we try to understand and
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you get to make the
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
policy decision you get to decide if we
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
want to adopt for New Hampshire a
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
mandate that might have upward pressure
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
on premiums
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
so our team will come in and say this
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
might have upward pressure on premiums
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but uh we will we will try not to
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
make that or to pretend to make that
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
policy decision for you
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and if you think you need more or
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
better information from the Department
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
you let me know
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh and finally I just want to point out
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh for those of you who see
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer service number the
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
800-852-3416 I highlight that that's
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
going to get you to the uh
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
is it seven member seven-member consumer
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
service team uh for any of your
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
constituent concerns if you want to come
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
through djri for those or through Sarah
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
directly to d uh to Keith and his team
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
you can do that but the most direct way
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
is that 800 number
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions you
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
that was great
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that I guess in terms of
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
issues that I want to emphasize is the
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
um solvency and that that when you think
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
about why the insurance department was
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
created way back in 1851 the issue was
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
always that is we want to make sure that
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
an insurance company sells an insurance
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
product is going to be able to pay
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
if there is a claim being made so people
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
often would argue when it comes to other
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
types of insurance like health insurance
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
like why aren't they holding costs down
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
why aren't they beating them down you
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
know on the premium down that we take
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the position that it's a competitive
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and that what's more
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
important and what their obligation is
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
is solvency and not not necessarily so
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody because you've met somebody
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
if someone was to come in and offer a
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
very extreme premium
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you you might caution them but that
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time if they really want to
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
sell that product at that outrageous
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
price uh and as long as you feel that
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
there's solvent but you could then say
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
yes but you know gee you're never going
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
to sell any of these policies you only
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
might sell one or two and and then
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
therefore you might still have a
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
solvency problem if your premium was too
 
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
high chairman hunt that's that's 100
 
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
right and New Hampshire hasn't had a
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
company go insolvent in a generation 90
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
nine was the last one are you making me
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
that old uh no I think it's a it's a
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
testament to the work we're doing uh and
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
the company that company actually came
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire uh home insurance yeah
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire from somewhere
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
else but toughs toughs you know we they
 
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:08.339 align:start position:0%
theoretically they did have a solvency
 
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:09.829 align:start position:0%
theoretically they did have a solvency
issue

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I would just add to that hopefully
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
this makes you feel a little younger
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
chairman we're still doing runoff on
 
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:18.020 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
is Dave Nichols still doing it is he
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
still running oh yeah oh yeah no but I
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
mean it's a very very good point because
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
when one of these companies uh goes
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
belly up it is an absolute bear of an
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
experience and it takes an incredibly
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly long time to close this thing
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
out as the commissioner said the last
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
one was in 99 they keep telling us that
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're five years away but I've heard
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
that for the last two years that they
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
keep saying it's five years so I don't
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
know when this will actually finish out
 
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:50.099 align:start position:0%
but uh it is not uh in any way shape or
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
form or good thing when one of these
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
companies becomes insolvent
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions okay
 
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.190 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions okay
representative

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for um a very uh comprehensive
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh detailed uh clear and interesting uh
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
overview of the work of the department
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious as to
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
um what issue you would identify as the
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
one that you're dealing with at this
 
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.849 align:start position:0%
one that you're dealing with at this
time

00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
um that you you consider to be the most
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
what channel and difficult and
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
I think uh that's a hard that's a great
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
question it's a hard one to answer one I
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate I think
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I think the the one thing that gives
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
me the most concern is the shift from
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
State regulated health insurance
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
products to erisa products erisa
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
products that aren't regulated at the
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
state level not regulated by mandates
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
that you Embrace and not regulated by my
 
00:51:58.319 --> 00:51:59.210 align:start position:0%
that you Embrace and not regulated by my
department

00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
and that's because it is the worst
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer I give when I get a call when I
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
get a call from someone saying I need
 
00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
get a call from someone saying I need
help

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
I need help getting somebody a referral
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
I need help getting somebody a placement
 
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
I need help getting a bill cleaned up
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
whatever that might look like and it
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
looks like a lot of different things
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
when it turns into a self-funded product
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
my wings are somewhat clipped and so to
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
me that's probably the thing that I
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
would like to work on the most
 
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.470 align:start position:0%
would like to work on the most
um

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would just add to piggyback onto that
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
you know and in the course the the
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
corresponding effect that that shift has
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
had on New Hampshire's small group
 
00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:40.069 align:start position:0%
had on New Hampshire's small group
Market

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
Market
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
our small group Market has been
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
shrinking for a number of years now and
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
obviously that has consequences on our
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
state's employers and ultimately the
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
coverage that they can provide to their
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
employees the other thing that I would
 
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.049 align:start position:0%
employees the other thing that I would
mention

00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit on the lighter side
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the Commissioners touched upon it
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I've touched upon it but I'll hit it
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
just one more time
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that is letting the public know that
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
we're we're there
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I sit right outside of um kind of the
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
the admin who handles most of the
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
incoming to uh to the commissioner and I
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
and it drives me crazy that at least
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
once or twice a week she receives a call
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
from a consumer looking to buy an
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
insurance policy from us
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
um there's just a little bit of a
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
disconnect there between uh what it is
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
we do and what it is that they're
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
they're looking for
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
and obviously we can't help a consumer
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
that doesn't know that we exist and that
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
we are a resource to help them you know
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
the good news is is that obviously we've
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
entered a different phase of the
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic and it's now allowing us to
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
re-engage in our Outreach events uh
 
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of different events a
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
different uh targeting of of population
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
groups I'm very excited to say that in
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
two weeks we're starting our insurance
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
course at New England college that
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
obviously is geared toward helping to
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
train the next generation of insurance
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
professionals but we're here for the
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
public and um so to the extent that you
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
can help us spread that word it would be
 
00:54:10.569 --> 00:54:10.579 align:start position:0%
deeply appreciated
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer thank you
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt uh you mentioned I think
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
you said something like 4 million in uh
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
in claims that you uh got refunded from
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
people I'm interested in how how does
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
that pan out I mean is there any one
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
area that is particularly uh uh claim
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
worthy or uh the one area where you
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
would see the biggest number would be
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
say a life insurance claim where we help
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh resolve an issue with uh payment of a
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
claim so you're going to get a
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
potentially a 250 or a million dollar a
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
resolution when when those stand out I
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
think in large part
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
um the kind of Lion's Share outside of
 
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
that will be a big health insurance
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
claims you know somebody has a hip uh
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
replaced while they're out of state in
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
say Montana they forget to get you know
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
just making this up as we go they forget
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
to get pre-auth and the bill comes to
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
their out-of-state Health insurer who
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
says wait a minute you told us this was
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
going to be an inpatient or an
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
outpatient became an patient and the
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
Bill gets rejected for lacking a
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
pre-auth DJ and I spent several weeks on
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
the call with the commissioner in
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
Montana with the hospital and with the
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
health insurer we get it resolved in in
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
one swoop that might be was it eighty
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
thousand sixty thousand dollars
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then there are the smallest claim
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
that we resolved this year
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
is somebody who had uh insurance premium
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
monthly insurance premium uh spill sent
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
to them then it said in the in the
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
footnote of the pre-printed invoice
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
three dollars of this premium is for a
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
paper billing fee
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have that bill this year
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
well the fact of the matter is that that
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
was a pre-printed form and that wasn't
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
in fact part of the 17 premium uh but we
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
took the position that you're saying
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
it's for paper billing fee they're not
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
paper billing and so you have to give
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
them the three bucks back and so we
 
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.770 align:start position:0%
them the three bucks back and so we
spent

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
an hour in a meeting discussing how
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to mandate this company send
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
the three dollar check back and then
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
they did
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
so that's the range I I would say that
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm very proud of this
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee have accomplished we'll
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
briefly touch upon them when we talk
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
about the consumer protection act but in
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act there are
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
four entities that have an exemption
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
from the consumer protection act and one
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
of them is the insurance department and
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
this committee actually passed the
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
statute that required restitution by the
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department to ensure that
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
every consumer is made whole
 
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
so I would say that that's one of our
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
our accomplishments when it comes to
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
and it works perfectly I think the
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
department because we have the staff and
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
the expertise to do it but the other
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
thing it does is it turns out that there
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
are occasions where we find companies uh
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
this year uh 2020 actually one of them
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
will fall in 22 one of them will fall in
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
23 but we had a company that was fined
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
250 000 I paid that and and uh a check
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
that we I have received but have not
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
cashed yet for 23 will be a 257 000 and
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
this is just a company doing something
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
wrong several hundred times and we said
 
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.790 align:start position:0%
wrong several hundred times and we said
enough

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
enough
um

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you both for uh
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
coming to testify and instruct us
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
um just as a general uh rule if you
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
could help us establish one the the
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
difference between uh the purview of
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
state government and federal government
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
you said uh in the beginning of your uh
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
presentation that it was traditionally
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
state governments purview but if you
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
could just give us uh where the
 
00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
boundaries are so we know what our
 
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:52.220 align:start position:0%
Authority can affect
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative uh I appreciate the
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
question and unfortunately there's
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
there's no way in the amount of time
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
that any of us have today is to lay out
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
all the boundaries I think it's helpful
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
to understand that the vast majority of
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
PNC Insurance the kind of car House
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
business insurance is going to be
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
regulated entirely here in New Hampshire
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh the carabouts from that are very
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
small and those would be for for lines
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
of business that there isn't a ready
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
market for and I don't think we need to
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
to think about that today
 
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
um the next biggest chunk of uh of
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
authority that we don't have would be
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
things related to the AC
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
so you know uh Obamacare uh things
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
mandates that come from there uh and
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
then finally uh uh Orissa and so those
 
00:58:37.329 --> 00:58:37.339 align:start position:0%
are Arisa is
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
employer-provided health insurance
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
um for large companies that will go
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
across straight lines and therefore
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
isn't subject to any states regulation
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
and the other uh big one that I would
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
highlight is to our great relief we do
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
not touch Medicare or Medicaid
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
we do oversee Medicaid Medicare excuse
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
me supplemental products but if you've
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
got an issue with Medicare or Medicaid
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
writ large then you're going to go over
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
and see our friends at the Department of
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:12.380 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.849 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
[Music]

00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
so now you want to press the button
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes
 
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes
um

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
your discussion brought up a question uh
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to try and
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
summarize where where this question
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
comes from and it's something that
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
actually happened to me personally that
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use it as an example my
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
personal issue with insurance has been
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
resolved so I'm not asking you to
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
resolve my personal issue but I'm using
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
it as an example in case something
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
similar should occur to one of my
 
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.010 align:start position:0%
similar should occur to one of my
constituents

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
um okay uh I when I retired I retained
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
my federal employee health insurance uh
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
federal Blue Cross Blue Shield uh so
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
when I became eligible for Medicare I
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
got only part A hospitalization I did
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
not get Part B
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
because I was already paying for my
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
federal uh employee insurance
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh then I had surgery and it I stayed
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
overnight but apparently technically the
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
hospital considered it to be outpatient
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
surgery even though I stayed overnight
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
the result was that Medicare and Blue
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
Cross kept passing the bill back and
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
forth each of them refusing to pay it
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the hospital sending me a bill for
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
thirty seven thousand dollars
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
and uh this was eventually resolved uh
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
because it was technically outpatient
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross did pay it but if
 
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
a constituent were to come to me with
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
such a question is that something that I
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
would tell them to call you or the
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
or who could help them with that
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going I'm going to go on on a limb
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
here and say it's always probably
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
quicker just to say call Chris and DJ
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and if we need to call our friends
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
over at HHS we're happy to when you're
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with combined
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
services like this uh and when you're
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
looking at coordination of benefits
 
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
typically the reason that those bills
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
get hung up is because both the uh the
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
primary insurance and the federal
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
insurance will have expectations for how
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
the others bills get delivered and when
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
those aren't done when the eobs the
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
explanation of benefits aren't aren't
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
provided to
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh Blue Cross is liking you'll see that
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
nothing happens totally in action and so
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
if you were to call me in that case I
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
would call my folks at Anthem and say
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
resolve this and in the day they call me
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
back and say I just need the EOB and and
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
we would then call the provider and say
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
give us the EOB so we can make this go
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
away but our department would be
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely the place to handle those
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you can get close all right
 
01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.650 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you can get close all right
close

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
um if you turn yours off the speaker
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
should work oh okay good
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
um last year the year before
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and for several years there's been a
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about Paid Family
 
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.390 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about Paid Family
Leave

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
Leave
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
and so I was wondering if there was a
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
document you could provide us with to
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
um just help us become more educated on
 
01:02:20.339 --> 01:02:22.190 align:start position:0%
um just help us become more educated on
how

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
that works sure absolutely the first
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
thing to note is it's been a wonderful
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
collaboration between our department the
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Employment
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
Security we've kind of become the Three
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
Amigos in standing up the state's Paid
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
Family Leave program there is a lot of
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
information out there right now
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
the enrollment for individuals into the
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
program just opened January 1st the
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment period for the business
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
Community opened I want to save December
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
15th my understanding is that
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
preliminary enrollment for the business
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
Community has been healthy has been
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
strong so obviously that's very very
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
encouraging news but there is a lot of
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
information about the basics of the
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
program I'll be happy to put a package
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
together for for the committee to the
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
extent that you all are interested and
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting time obviously as
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
this thing is playing out in in real
 
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.730 align:start position:0%
this thing is playing out in in real
time

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
so I don't yield back the balance
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um you have asked us to assist
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
us with your Outreach efforts um I'm
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
thinking back over the course of my
 
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
lifetime in the several states where
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
I've lived
 
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.089 align:start position:0%
I've lived
um

01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
State Insurance departments that I'm
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
thinking of in other states have
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
Consumer Guides to Insurance in the
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
state of blank uh just wondering do we
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
have such a guide is it readily
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
available on the website and would that
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
would that not assist us in helping you
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
with your Outreach efforts to be able to
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
tell people that they can go to the
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
state's Insurance website and order a
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
copy of the consumer guide to Insurance
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do we ever we've got a
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
consumer document for just about
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
everything we deal with the only
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
drawback that I will share with you at
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
this time is that it is on our website
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
which is not very good we're going
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
through the process right now of
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
rebuilding our website we're joining the
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
rest of the state agencies in that
 
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.130 align:start position:0%
rest of the state agencies in that
process

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:33.140 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
so for the purposes of this committee it
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
might be better for me to put a package
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
together for you along with the
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
information that I promised to
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative bolio and get it right
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
over to you so that you have that not
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
only for your own purposes but also for
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
for your constituents and in a couple of
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
months time we're going to have a brand
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
spanking new website that's going to be
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
very user friendly and all of those
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
documents will be in one place so that
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
when the consumer goes to the website
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
they know exactly where to find the
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
information that they need one other
 
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
thing I would mention because it kind of
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
Blends together a couple of different
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions that we've received in terms
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
of things that worry Us in terms of
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
where the state and federal
 
01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.930 align:start position:0%
where the state and federal
um

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
a line is and then Medicare one of the
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
things that we have seen recently is a
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
an uptick in deceptive and manipulative
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
marketing practices around Medicare
 
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.010 align:start position:0%
marketing practices around Medicare
Advantage

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
the states used to have the ability to
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
oversee Medicare Advantage products and
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
those are separate let me make the
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
distinction from Medicare supplemental
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
products we still have authority over
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
supplementals not Advantage the states
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
lost Medicare Advantage Marketing
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
oversight in the early 2000s with the
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
Medicare modernization Act and the
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
trouble is that
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a dynamic play out and it's
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
not just
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the advertisements that you see on TV
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
although let me be very clear
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I admire Joe Namath William Shatner
 
01:06:07.569 --> 01:06:07.579 align:start position:0%
is a phenomenal actor don't get your
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
medical insurance advice from these
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
folks please
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but but more seriously and more
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
prevalent are a third overseas third
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
party organizations that are making
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
excessive calls to people and they're
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
linked up with agents and we're not sure
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
where yet we've tried to do a little bit
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
of undercover work and unfortunately one
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
of our communication staffers got a
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
little too deep into this investigation
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
and he started getting so many calls
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
from these advertisers it nearly
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
rendered his phone unusable
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
by not having control over you know
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the person you're talking
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
to wherever they are is licensed because
 
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
to wherever they are is licensed because
that's

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
part of the deal here
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then also understanding what is it
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
that they're representing to the
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
consumer what is part of the sales pitch
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about a
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
population that could sometimes be
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
vulnerable as as the senior population
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly difficult for us to get
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
those calls from a senior who has gotten
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
pulled into some Medicare Advantage plan
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
and it's just overturned their entire
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
world and the only
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
tool at our disposal is to introduce
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
them to the federal process by which
 
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
they can appeal
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the feedback that we get is that
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
that process is in many cases a black
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
hole in other cases is incredibly
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
difficult and slow to work through
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
so we have asked our federal
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
counterparts if they would consider
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
giving States back some of that
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
Authority and it's an ongoing
 
01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.650 align:start position:0%
Authority and it's an ongoing
conversation

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
well it really should happen because uh
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
let's face it advantages only for people
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
who are over 65 so I mean that's that's
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
the vulnerable group so it's it's uh it
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
does do something okay great thank you
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
very much thank you uh we do have a
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
little time left so what I'm going to do
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
is I'm going to introduce some allow

01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
pleasure to come before uh house
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
Commerce I think it is certainly from
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
our clients perspective the most
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
important uh Committee in the
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
legislature as commissioner nicolopoulos
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh New Hampshire has got a
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
good a competitive environment for
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
insurance and that's due largely to the
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
laws that you have passed and the laws
 
01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:57.620 align:start position:0%
that you have decided not to pass
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
which which make it a good environment
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
for insurance companies to do business
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
and then the second part of that is the
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
quality of insurance regulation these
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
are the things that companies look to uh
 
01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:13.100 align:start position:0%
when they decide where to do business
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Affairs very well both
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the legislative side of things the
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
business friendly
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
Outlook of the state generally and also
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
the quality of insurance regulation and
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of our time is spent uh dealing
 
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:32.540 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
representing our company clients and uh
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
um they
 
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
they play a very important role as I
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
think was emphasized it's really it's
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
state regulation apart from health
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
insurance which is another totally other
 
01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:49.820 align:start position:0%
uh being
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
it is this unlike Banking and securities
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
which are of equal size roughly to the
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars in the insurance
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
business it really is the state
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
Regulators that have all the authority
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
again other than health insurance to
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
regulate uh what insurance companies
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
practices are so it's a very important
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
job and we thank you Mr chairman great
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
so just you know you all know is um we
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
talked about domestic insurance
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
companies in foreign
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
does not mean International form means
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
domestic is uh uh are regulated here by
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
the state we have a domestic and George
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
represents the domestic so if you have a
 
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
domestic insurance company problem
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
don't bother calling Chris DJ just call
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.610 --> 01:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mike McLaughlin I'm
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
a lawyer talked real close
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer in a lobbyist in Concord
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm the Regional Council
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
for Allstate Insurance in New Hampshire
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont I've been wandering
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
the Halls since 1994. uh started my work
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
in this in the state senate as a
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
Legislative Assistant so I've been here
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
for quite a while working with chairman
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
hunt and members of the committee
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
um one thing that the insurance
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
department emphasized this morning was
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
their availability and they have been
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
integral in working with the companies
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
as well as the consumers and we always
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to talk to them
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
about issues one of the things that
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt pointed out earlier was
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act which you'll
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
hear from many people how insurance is
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
segregated out and it's segregated out
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
because of the work of the Commerce
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
Committee and the consumer has a media
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
access to his um a remedy whereas if you
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
go through the legal channels you end up
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
in court or paying legal fees and
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
Recovery is way down the road so when
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
you look at the work the Commerce
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
Committee does it's consumer oriented
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
but it's also business friendly and
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
business friendly doesn't mean that
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
consumers are put at a disadvantage the
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
playing field is equal premium rates are
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
competitive throughout in New Hampshire
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
with lowest insurance rates in the
 
01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:14.830 align:start position:0%
with lowest insurance rates in the
country

01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
we talk about mandatory Insurance every
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
couple days but this year the bill got
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
pulled because we don't it was a an
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
interesting the only com the only state
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
in the Union does not have compulsory
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
liability insurance and it works uh it's
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive we don't want to get
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
into discussion John but it's a please
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
not please do not we've done we've done
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
it every other year for 10 years but I
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with you uh I'm
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
available in Concord and thanks for your
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
service to the state great
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative it's sort of a
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
question and maybe a comment I'm not
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
really sure where it goes
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
I being a new uh
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
rep at this I had to spend a lot of time
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
over the summer knocking on doors I
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
knocked on almost 1800 doors
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I heard from a lot of people and at
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
least one lawyer and three or four
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
constituents that said that New
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an insurance State if you
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
have a problem with insurance and you go
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
up against the insurance company because
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
they decide not to pay
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I know we care about what how
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are perceived but at
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
least the constituents and Nashua Ward
 
01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:40.490 align:start position:0%
least the constituents and Nashua Ward
3.

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
3.
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
think there's some kind of a
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
disadvantage here and maybe somebody
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
needs to do some homework
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
we would hope that uh after you spend
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
some time on this committee
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
you'll have be armed and ready to help
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
educate your constituents but I hope
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's also not true and I don't know that
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
yet that's true that's what I'm saying
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping when you've been on this
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee you'll have learned that how
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
this issue is solved thank you very much
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Amelia
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
galderi I'm the bank commissioner for
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
um just give it a minute for the handout
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
to float around here
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
is that right all right very good you're
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if I had enough there
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so again my name is Amelia galjeri
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%

um I brought
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
um a team of folks with me today who I
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
think are going to be primarily handling
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
legislation for us
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to take a moment and
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
introduce them all to you and these will
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
probably be the faces of folks who
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
you'll most often see here if you have
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
any questions about banking Department
 
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.850 align:start position:0%
any questions about banking Department
issues

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
um I would direct you to these folks or
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
to myself so
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
um first um is Bob Lamberti he is our
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
Deputy general counsel
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
um Ian Clark is our public information
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
officer uh Seth Zaraki is our general
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
counsel Mike moranti hiding in the back
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
is my my new Deputy
 
01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
um he uh started about a week ago so
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're happy to have him
 
01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.209 align:start position:0%
we're happy to have him
um

01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:14.219 --> 01:24:16.010 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see on the handout it
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
starts with our mission statement so the
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
banking department is committed to
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
protecting the Public's interests
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
through the professional supervision of
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the financial services it regulates so
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
we are primarily a consumer protection
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
agency I'm tasked with uh
 
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
supervising financial institutions
 
01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:37.610 align:start position:0%
supervising financial institutions
um

01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
what that means in Practical terms is we
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
have teams of examiners who go out and
 
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.770 align:start position:0%
have teams of examiners who go out and
examine

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:44.780 align:start position:0%
examine
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
banks credit unions Consumer Credit
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
division licensees for safety and
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
soundness in their operations as well as
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
compliance with applicable laws and
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
rules another primary function of ours
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
is consumer facing so we take consumer
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
complaints and investigate them for
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
allegations of unfair and deceptive
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
activity or potential unlicensed
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
activity just to name a few categories
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then another way that we carry out
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
our mission is through off-site
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring all the entities that are
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
licensed with us are chartered with us
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
have to submit um quarterly data to us
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
that we monitor very closely for any
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
changes any unusual activity that sort
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so to to carry out that activity
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the handout
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
um there's information on here about the
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
structure of the banking Department
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're divided into five divisions so
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
first we have con the consumer credit
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
division the CCD division they oversee
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
several thousand Consumer Credit
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
licensees those are comprised of
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
Mortgage Bankers mortgage brokers
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
mortgage servicers small loan lenders
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
title loan lenders money transmitters so
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
think Western Union PayPal they're
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
licensed with us debt Adjusters
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's all of them
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
um so that's the consumer credit
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
division they they oversee those
 
01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:08.030 align:start position:0%
division they they oversee those
entities

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
we have a banking division they're
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
tasked with overseeing the activities of
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
17 State Charter Banks and nine State
 
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
chartered credit unions
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
we have the trust supervision division
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
they oversee the activities of 41
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
non-depository trust companies and
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
Family Trust companies so a trust
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
company is um there they range in
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
activities for several years now we've
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
been undertaking efforts to modernize
 
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
our trust company laws in New Hampshire
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
to attract
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
um a vibrant trust industry and some of
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the trust companies are more what you
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
would consider traditional they oversee
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
a family's private wealth however
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
there's also several creative uses for
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
trust companies that choose to be within
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction because of our
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
modernized laws managing all sorts of
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
different kind of investment vehicles
 
01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
different kind of investment vehicles
and

01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
items like that
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
um finally so those are the three kind
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
of subject matter areas that we have
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
um we also have a legal division that
 
01:27:12.169 --> 01:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
supports those divisions so the legal
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
division provides advice to the the
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office the other offices
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the banking department they
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
investigate consumer complaints and
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
allegations of unlicensed activity
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
um they make commence an enforcement
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
action based on what they find in those
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
complaints or from referrals from the
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
exam team and additionally they assist
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
with legislative efforts so you'll
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
notice I have a couple of them here with
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
me today
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
um and finally we have an Operations
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
Division that supports the daily
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
functions of the banking department so
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
they like pay our bills keep the lights
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
on et cetera do our budgeting
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and very important stuff
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
um so all in all we have 48 positions at
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
the banking department for staff and if
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
you flip to the back of your handout
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's not on the back of mine but it
 
01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
should be on the back of yours there's a
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
org chart
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um which is microscopic and I apologize
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
for that but I just wanted to give you a
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
sense visually of
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
what we have at the banking department
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
for human resources if you have any
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
questions about that I can provide you
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
with a digital copy that you might want
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
to just email this to us so yeah we can
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
zoom in yeah well actually when you put
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
it on the screen it's not not too bad so
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
um but I apologize for that I just
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you a sense of what we
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
have at the banking department for human
 
01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.370 align:start position:0%
have at the banking department for human
resources

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so moving right along another
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
important issue is how the banking
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
department is funded
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
um we are a self-funded agency so that
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
means we're entirely funded by the
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that we regulate so
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
um technically speaking when you see our
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
budget we are classified as our revenues
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
are classified as 100 coming from other
 
01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:51.530 align:start position:0%
are classified as 100 coming from other
sources

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
so what that means in Practical terms is
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
at the start of each fiscal year
 
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
um we we receive a appropriation from
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state's general fund then over the
 
01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:05.780 align:start position:0%
course of that fiscal year we take in
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
examination fees fines penalties
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and apply those towards that
 
01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
um and apply those towards that
appropriation

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the fiscal year
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
we tally it all up and if there's a
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
deficit between the amount of fees fines
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
and penalties we took in and the amount
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the appropriation we invoice our
 
01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:29.540 align:start position:0%
entities an assessment amount for that
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
deficit basically
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
so in a nutshell that's how we're funded
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm happy to answer any like
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a question about any
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
of this at any time just raise your hand
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I can also take questions at the end
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
um the final thing I thought you might
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
want to hear about is our upcoming
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
um so we have two that were
 
01:29:53.219 --> 01:29:54.229 align:start position:0%
um so we have two that were
um

01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh working on this year the first is has
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do with the money transmitters model
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
law and exemptions from licensure so
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
um money transmitters are for the most
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
part large entities that are licensed in
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
all 50 states
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it's important that um we make that
 
01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
licensing process as business friendly
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
as possible so so that um entities it's
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
not a cumbersome process for them to get
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
licensed in different states
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
so in furtherance of that goal the
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
conference of State Bank supervisors
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
which is a trade organization that the
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
banking Department belongs to put forth
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
a money transmitter model law to the
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
states to encourage that um sort of ease
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
of licensure to make our laws match up
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
as as best you can taking into account
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
different states nuances
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so that was kind of a new initiative
 
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
from the csbs that we've been wrap
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
getting our arms around and we decided
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
this year that it would take a lot of
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
resources to try to fully um make that
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire so
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
um we focused on a section of that
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
monologue which is the exemptions from
 
01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
licensure because one
 
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
um thing we've heard from licensed
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
entities is that there were certain
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
exemptions in other states laws that we
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have in our law and when we
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
reviewed those they made a lot of sense
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so we thought that since we had
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
received a lot of phone calls about that
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of inquiries it would make sense
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
to take that portion of the model law as
 
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
a first step in trying to move it into
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
our law for money transmitters
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the first legislative
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
initiative we're working on the second
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
one is more of a technical fix so
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
um the banking Department sets by
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
Statute sets the interest rate for
 
01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
escrow accounts associated with
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
mortgages so if you have an escrow for
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
your taxes to pay your taxes or
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance we the interest
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
rate for that escrow account is set by
 
01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.629 align:start position:0%
rate for that escrow account is set by
Statute

01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
so a couple years ago we had a bill that
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
changed how we calculated that interest
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
rate so it used to be before that bill
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
um we would have all the state chartered
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
Banks submit their savings account rates
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
and we would tally them up and average
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
them and subtract one and that would be
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
the interest rate for
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
um escrow accounts and as you might
 
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
imagine that was kind of a cumbersome
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
process it involved the entities
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
reporting to us we had to do some math
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's not so bad
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
um but you can imagine that it was a bit
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
cumbersome so and for years and years
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
and years it was always zero so a couple
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
years ago we changed that law working in
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the bankers to um tie
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
that interest rate amount to the federal
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
funds rate
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
so when we did that however we
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
inadvertently missed that it that same
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
exact language was in the consumer
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
credit uh mortgage Banker broker law so
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
then we realized it and we had a problem
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
because we still had to sort of
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
calculate that rate for all the mortgage
 
01:33:10.139 --> 01:33:11.149 align:start position:0%
calculate that rate for all the mortgage
companies

01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
so um this year we've sought to make
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
those match we're also working with the
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
bankers Association to work out
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
um some Kinks that they've uncovered in
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
the course of the last couple years
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
trying to work through that that change
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
um so that's the other major legislative
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
initiative that we're working on this
 
01:33:29.639 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
initiative that we're working on this
year

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously we will be
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
tracking any other bills that might
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
apply to us
 
01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.430 align:start position:0%
apply to us
um

01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that's all I have prepared
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions or um
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
talk about anything else anyone is
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative could you explain a
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
little bit about uh exemptions from
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
licensure for money transmitters
 
01:33:55.739 --> 01:33:56.870 align:start position:0%
licensure for money transmitters
sure

01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
um so um again money transmitters think
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
Western Union is a kind of more
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
traditional model of one also PayPal is
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
a my transmitter it's basically anybody
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
who say I took five dollars from you and
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
gave it to representative hunt I would
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
be a money transmitter if I engaged in
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
that business regularly
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
so um there's a series under our line I
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
hope you don't make me reel them off I'm
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
not prepared to reel off all the
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions but there are several
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions to licensure under current
 
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.290 align:start position:0%
exemptions to licensure under current
law

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
um one example of one that we didn't
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
have in our law that it's in the model
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
law is an exemption for if um say it's
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
gonna com money transmitters are one of
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
our more complicated business models to
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
explain so I'm going to probably
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
oversimplify it
 
01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:43.850 align:start position:0%
oversimplify it
um

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
and hope that my money transmitter
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
expert who's listening at the office
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't yell at me
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
um so uh picture you have a bank account
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
and your bank contracts with a
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
third-party money transmitter to say you
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
want to send me money through your bank
 
01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
want to send me money through your bank
account

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:04.940 align:start position:0%
just like venmo
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
they are like venmo but venmo would not
 
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:09.179 align:start position:0%
be one that I'm talking about Citizens
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
Bank uh my bank has one called Zell I
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
haven't used it but it's the other one
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Zell could be an example I'm not
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
sure that they
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
are technically a third party I would
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
have to it's very contract driven how
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
they contract with the bank but for
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
example purposes think of that
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
um we in our law currently don't have an
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
exemption so that third party has to be
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
um licensed by us
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
however in most instances the bank is
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
the one that holds the liability I don't
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
I can't speak exactly to Zell so please
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
put that aside for this purpose but they
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
have a contract that governs say they
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
mess up that transfer the bank is the
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
one who's responsible at the end of the
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
day not the money transmitter in that
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
instance we feel there's enough
 
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
protection for the consumer because the
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
bank will be standing behind that
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
transaction that the third party
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need a license in that scenario
 
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of one of the
 
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
examples so it isn't that there would be
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
no regulations that some other entity is
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
already regulated so you don't need
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
additional regulations correct thank you
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
I mean some of them are also kind of as
 
01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
as somebody who's not like I have
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts in my
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
transmission some of them struck me I
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
was like oh is this an issue but one of
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
them is the U.S Postal Service
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
apparently some states have tried to
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
bring enforcement actions against the
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
U.S Postal Service for transmitting
 
01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
U.S Postal Service for transmitting
money

01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
um we've never done that it never seemed
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
like something to do but that is on the
 
01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:35.420 align:start position:0%
list in the proposed spell
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
so things like that does that answer
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
um last last session we passed a
 
01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.910 align:start position:0%
um last last session we passed a
cryptocurrency

01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation and I'm curious as
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
to whether or not you have
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh had any
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
noticed anything in regards to that
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
legislation in terms of banking or that
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
you have to deal with or may may impact
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
your business
 
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
so um I believe what you're referring to
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
is the UCC governing um commercial
 
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
transactions in cryptocurrency I'm I'm
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
probably misstating it technically but
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
that was I believe the bill you're
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
um so that bill
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
um really governs commercial
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
transactions between entities that don't
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
and those transactions don't necessarily
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
fall direct like we don't enforce the
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
UCC the UCC govern strength
 
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.050 align:start position:0%
UCC the UCC govern strength
contractual

01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:41.060 align:start position:0%
contractual
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me transactions between entities
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
so that's not something I would expect
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
to see a lot of occasionally when we
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
examine an institution we might
 
01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.330 align:start position:0%
examine an institution we might
um

01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
see some interaction with the Uniform
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code but it's very minimal so
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't expect to see anything
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I haven't
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of that though I have not
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
however we have been acutely aware of
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency this fall we did
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
participate in the governor's
 
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.689 align:start position:0%
participate in the governor's
cryptocurrency

01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
um commission study commission and
 
01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:16.490 align:start position:0%
um commission study commission and
additionally

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
um several of the entities that you
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps heard about in the news did have
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
money transmitter licenses that governed
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
a small portion of their business
 
01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:28.460 align:start position:0%
we have a specific law in New Hampshire
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
that states that money transmission
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
there companies that are money
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
transmitters for cryptocurrency to
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency so say you have
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and you want to give it
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
to a person over here
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
The Entity that you give it to if you
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
just give the cryptocurrency that's not
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
subject to our laws our laws we only
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
license money transmitters who take in
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and give out fiat
 
01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.430 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and give out fiat
currency

01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
currency
 
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
so we really had just a small sector of
 
01:39:03.649 --> 01:39:03.659 align:start position:0%
entities that
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
sort of fell into that bubble of
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and that was from the
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
first a couple years ago where we did
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
the money transmitter we rewrote the
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
legislative the statute and then this
 
01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
issue came up and then we made it clear
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
that it is not regulated by the banking
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
department and I believe that you do
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
have something on your web page that
 
01:39:26.450 --> 01:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
informs consumers one should State what
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
that what that statement is yes I will
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
double check we just redid our website
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
it used to be pretty front and center
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
but I think it might have moved to the
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
consumer credit section but it makes it
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
clear that it that they do not regulate
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here my question did
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to do with crypto but I'll broaden
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
it out the products are getting so
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
complicated the digital assets digital
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
products for our consumers so what are
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that you see that
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
would be impacting our consumers that
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about and where the
 
01:40:11.689 --> 01:40:11.699 align:start position:0%
lines are being blurred between Banking
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
and securities what are you on the
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
lookout to protect consumers that we
 
01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:20.219 align:start position:0%
might want to keep on our radar
 
01:40:20.219 --> 01:40:20.990 align:start position:0%
might want to keep on our radar
um

01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
so I would I think consumer education is
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
always important a lot of this requires
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
very clear sedatements because you might
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
as might notice I slowed down when I
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
talk about the cryptocurrency I want to
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
be really clear about what we regulate
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
and what we don't because that really
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
governs the sort of relief that a
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
consumer can potentially have because if
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
it falls under our jurisdiction it's
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
exempt from the consumer protection act
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and we would we would handle any sort of
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement action associated with it
 
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.090 align:start position:0%
enforcement action associated with it
um

01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to educate
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
consumers and be really clear about what
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
is under our jurisdiction what isn't
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
that would be something that is
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
constantly on my mind
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
and are there any particular concerns
 
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
that you have that we would need to take
 
01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
a look at as far as some of the newer
 
01:41:09.659 --> 01:41:11.450 align:start position:0%
a look at as far as some of the newer
products

01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
can't think of any off the top of my
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
head we we're pretty aggressive about
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
coming right forward when we find out
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
about new products and and dealing with
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
them and figuring we have a process of
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
the banking department where we can
 
01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
the banking department where we can
accept

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
um requests from entities who might have
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
a question if they fall under our
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and require a license or
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
not where they can request a no action
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
letter from us that details whether or
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
not they need a license so we try to
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
stay on top of it as best we can through
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
monitoring those and consumer complaints
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
and try to really get out ahead of it
 
01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.350 align:start position:0%
and try to really get out ahead of it
mm-hmm

01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you Mr
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
chair uh two quick questions one um
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
Keith could probably I'm sorry
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon could probably
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
answer this too has the governor's
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
Commission on crypto come out with a
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
report at this time or is it forthcoming
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I believe it was submitted to the
 
01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.830 align:start position:0%
I believe it was submitted to the
governor

01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it's been uploaded to
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
the website yet
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
I haven't checked their website I
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
apologize yeah yeah it's been delivered
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the governor he's still reading it
 
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay but it hasn't been made public so
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
it should be any day or week you know I
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
would think very soon it was a week or
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
so a couple weeks ago now time flies
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're very busy it's pretty
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reports about 50 pages so
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
um follow up and just quick question do
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have on your website a list of the
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
personnel and how we contact them about
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
different issues yeah I believe so okay
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
yep it's kind of divided up
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize we did just get a new
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
website actually Ian's the person who um
 
01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
is our web person
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but I believe it's divided up by
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
division so if you go to that it should
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
take you to a contact perfect thank you
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative Terry
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner galdieri for your
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
overview of the uh State banking
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
department and your work and the
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
response to questions thus far a couple
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
questions members of the committee will
 
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
be familiar with these because I asked
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
the same of the insurance department
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
folks what's the most difficult issue
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with right now as a
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
department and number two I'm looking at
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
your uh I'm looking at your web page
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
here on my phone what there is a
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
consumer Complaint Form and instructions
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
do you have something comparable to what
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
the insurance department has and that is
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
a consumer guide to understand the
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
services that are provided by the state
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
banking department for their education
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
and their knowledge so two questions
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you so um we do have
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
several brochures that Ian is very
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
diligently updating
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
um they had gotten a bit out of date but
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
we're working on updating them and
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
making sure they're available in a
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
digital format we do have a guide on
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
there for how to fill out a Consumer
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
complaint and we have people who are
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
available at all times to answer the
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
phone and answer any questions people
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
may have so
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's like that that was that was the
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah the most difficult issue with which
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
the department is dealing at this time
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd say you know a couple of
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
things about that
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
um we are as I'm sure everyone talks
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
about who will come before you you know
 
01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:22.669 align:start position:0%
about who will come before you you know
keeping

01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
um obtaining retaining knowledgeable and
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
experienced staff is always something
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's on the Forefront I feel very
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
lucky at the banking Department we have
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
um compared to some agencies I shouldn't
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
even say this out loud but we have a
 
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
pretty good retention rate of Staff we
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
have several long-term staff some who
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
have been working for over 30 years at
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
the banking department so I feel really
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
lucky in that regard but it is something
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
that I constantly work at to maintain I
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
feel like one of my primary jobs as
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner is keeping and retaining
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
those staff because I can't do it all I
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
need experts who know what they're doing
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
to help me every day so that's always in
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Forefront of my mind I I feel lucky
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
that it's not a big problem but it's not
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
a big problem because we're constantly
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
working at it
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of like more of a
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
subject matter kind of thing
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
um we have been dealing with a lot of
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency uh inquiries we obviously
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
staffed the commission uh and are
 
01:45:20.639 --> 01:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
staffed the commission uh and are
constantly

01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:25.139 align:start position:0%
um responding to inquiries about it
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
um all trying to get our arms around new
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
new products that might be related to
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency it I don't know if that's
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily a problem but it's just a
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
part of our job that we are constantly
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
faced with and trying to get our arms
 
01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:44.470 align:start position:0%
faced with and trying to get our arms
around

01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh just say representative Cole I'm
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
looking that way thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
I want to Circle back to the escrow
 
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.189 align:start position:0%
I want to Circle back to the escrow
accounts

01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
what is the distance between your
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
calculated percentage and the federal
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
rate you're using
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
you calculated a percentage for the
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
escrow accounts now you're using a
 
01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:02.219 align:start position:0%
federal rate for it what's the
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
difference between the two are they
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
close to each other well so they used to
 
01:46:08.689 --> 01:46:08.699 align:start position:0%
be so historically the rate was Zero
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
um we'd tally up all the savings account
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
rates it would come up to a very small
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
average and then the law required us to
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
subtract one point from it so it was
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
always zero
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
um then we tied it to the federal funds
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
rate which at the time was Zero however
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure everyone is aware
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
um the they've been increasing the
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
amount of the federal funds rate pretty
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
steadily to try to combat inflation
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so that has brought the amount up
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
similarly potentially I think we're all
 
01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:43.340 align:start position:0%
aware that um
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
correspondingly you consumers have
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
access to
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
um places to park their money that have
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
a higher return on their you know rate
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
of return than historically when it was
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
all zero so it's sort of all they're all
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
sort of coming up together
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative is this another crypto
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
question yes it is it's very brief
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of Finance transactions
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
Financial transactions that are
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
occurring here in the state and
 
01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
around the world with cryptocurrencies
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
part of this our charge here is to
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
um have consumer protection Consumer
 
01:47:33.179 --> 01:47:34.189 align:start position:0%
um have consumer protection Consumer
Affairs

01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
so it bothers me that uh we don't who is
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody calls me with a problem
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh who am I going to refer them to
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh to to answer questions in regards to
 
01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.770 align:start position:0%
uh to to answer questions in regards to
whatever

01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know thank God FTX wasn't you
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
know out of Nashua and New Hampshire but
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of transactional
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh financial banking like activity going
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
on and I'm I'm very uncomfortable but
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
with the lack of
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
any apparent desire to
 
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
regulate or have a place where somebody
 
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
can go and and make a complaint so you
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
can always come to us FTX was licensed
 
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
by us as a money transmitter for the
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
activities they did taking in
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and giving out fiat
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
currency so they did have a license for
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
that small portion of their business
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
um we're always happy to answer
 
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
um we're always happy to answer
questions

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
um if if a consumer comes to us with a
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
question like that and we feel it
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall under our jurisdiction but
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
it may fall under the Department of
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
Justice or the Securities Bureau we have
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
excellent working relationships with
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
those agencies and um have sharing
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
agreements in place that we can share
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
those complaints freely and make sure
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
that consumers concerns are addressed
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
assuming it falls under the jurisdiction
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
of one of those entities
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I would say I would
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
always encourage people who have
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
questions to come to us we have fully
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
staffed phones and emails and any way
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
that you may need
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
um in terms of jurisdiction our
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is set by the statute
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
um so you know that would be something
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be addressed if
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to make clear that uh
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
even though crypto to crypto or digital
 
01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
asset to digital asset it's still
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
covered by consumer protection it is oh
 
01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:31.370 align:start position:0%
covered by consumer protection it is oh
yes

01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
and so you could file and that's in
 
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's in statute So you you're you're
 
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:37.609 align:start position:0%
that's in statute So you you're you're
um

01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh constituate could file a complaint
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
with the Consumer Protection Bureau in
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
that instance yep and that's the
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
committee did that that was our our very
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
strong position was that they were not
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to be able to use the banking
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
Department's exemption because they're
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
not regulated by the Banks and that yes
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
you have a private right of the
 
01:50:00.179 --> 01:50:02.450 align:start position:0%
you have a private right of the
restitution

01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
restitution
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
you you call either us or that and if
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
it's not us we'll send you to the doj if
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's not the doj we send you to
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
Securities we work very closely together
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
most likely it would probably fall
 
01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
underwater categories
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
so we can help you out but at the end of
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
the day you're going to have is it's
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much uh commissioner I
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
have to say that that
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
um even I can learn something new every
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
day I'd never heard of the conference of
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
State Bankers State Bank supervisors
 
01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:36.179 align:start position:0%
yeah they're supervisors yeah there are
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
trade organizations I never I guess I
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
never knew you know usually when the
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
insurance department come they all you
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
know tell that this is Nic and that I
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't know have we ever done anything
 
01:50:49.129 --> 01:50:49.139 align:start position:0%
that was really like when we did the
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
recodification where they were we using
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
them as a platform to work from I don't
 
01:50:56.810 --> 01:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
think so no they
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
of our legislative work
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
um we work even think when I did the
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
trust law I don't even remember them and
 
01:51:08.689 --> 01:51:08.699 align:start position:0%
they don't um dabbled in that either
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
they definitely are involved in that but
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
not as heavily like I think mostly the
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives tend to be the
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
consumer Consumer Credit division or
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives right
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
but learn something new every day
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay so we
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
do have some people from the banking
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
industry here
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off from the New
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:48.179 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you chairman hunt
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%

01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
ourselves today my name is Christy
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
Merrill I'm president of the New
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers Association and with
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%

01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
relations for New Hampshire Bankers as
 
01:52:00.179 --> 01:52:01.010 align:start position:0%
relations for New Hampshire Bankers as
well

01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
um we are a Statewide non-profit trade
 
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
Association we have the way our
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
membership works is the banks are our
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
members we have 38 members right now so
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
we have as the commissioner said we have
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
17 New Hampshire chartered Banks seven
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
federally chartered and 14 banks that
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
are based out of state we also have
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
trust companies as members as well
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
um and the banking industry in New
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employs about 6 000 people
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
Statewide and I think you all probably
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
know that the banking the banking
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
industry plays a really big part of New
 
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy so it's important
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
that um you know they they try to be
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
good corporate citizens they have a lot
 
01:52:41.870 --> 01:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
of employees and they try to make the
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
economy go by issuing loans to
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
individuals and families and companies
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that was most recently seen through
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
the really high volume of PPP loans
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
and so because of that we're really
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
excited that we there have been four de
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
novo Banks which are just banks that are
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
newly started from the ground up and
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
have to raise their Capital we've had
 
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
four in 15 years in New Hampshire so we
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
think that bodes really well and speaks
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
well to New Hampshire's economy and so
 
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
we're excited to see that and as good
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
corporate citizens they they are very
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
much invested in the community they try
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
to support the communities through
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
charitable service and charitable
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
Financial giving last October we hosted
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
our second annual what's known as New
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banks give back and so we ask
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
our members to just take one of their
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
normal Community Service events and
 
01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
schedule that in the month of October
 
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
and so just really quickly we're happy
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
to say that in just the month of October
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
of last year we had 29 Banks participate
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
we had 409 volunteer events 2008
 
01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
volunteers almost 3 000 hours
 
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
volunteered and 538 946 dollars and
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
monetary donations and that was just in
 
01:53:59.209 --> 01:53:59.219 align:start position:0%
one month so that just is a snapshot of
 
01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:02.219 align:start position:0%
what they do on a regular basis
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
I did want to also share that at New
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers we also run an
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
insurance trust that was created in 1950
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
and that supports our members and so
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
from time to time in addition to banking
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
issues we obviously work with the
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
banking Department very closely we will
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes comment on a insurance
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as it may impact our
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
insurance trust we have are self-insured
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
we have self-insured medical we have
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
dental vision
 
01:54:28.199 --> 01:54:28.850 align:start position:0%
dental vision
um

01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
health and a life and disability as well
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing I just wanted
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
to point out is the banking industry is
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
no surprise it's very heavily regulated
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
so they are under what's known as the
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
Dual regulatory system so every Bank
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
chooses their state primary regulator or
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
they have a state regulator or they and
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
they have a federal primary regulator
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
unless they decide that they want to
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
have a national Charter and so we do
 
01:54:54.649 --> 01:54:54.659 align:start position:0%
have a couple of banks located in New
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have opted to have a
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
national Charter so they are heavily
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
examined and they take turns with their
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
examiners and they are usually visited
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
for a few months or several weeks at a
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
time every 18 months so I just wanted to
 
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
mention that and hand it over to you
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
Ryan excellent
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
well thank you Christy and uh uh
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
congratulations to you all on uh being
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
elected and uh participating in this uh
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
committee um as Chrissy mentioned we uh
 
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're in front of this committee quite a
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
bit since all the banking uh um any stat
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
any Bill related to banking lands here
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I Christy mentioned that uh how the
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
banking industry is regulated I do have
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
a handout that I'll provide the
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee that kind of gives an overview
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
of that and essentially what we try to
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
do is just maintain balance between the
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and state
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
regulations so the the scale's not
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
tipped in One Direction versus the other
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and just to give you an idea a little
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
background uh behind how we make
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
determinations on positions we have a
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that meets once a
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
month we take a look at every bill that
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially impact the industry we
 
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
review it we look at the consequences we
 
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
look at parity and make a determination
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
recommendation on positions that the
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
association should take
 
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:12.109 align:start position:0%
association should take
um

01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're here as a resource for the
 
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
committee I'll also hand out my business
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
card if you had all if you at any point
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
have questions in regards to any of the
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
banking related uh issues that come
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
before you please feel free to reach out
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
to myself or Christy we're happy to be
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
here as a resource for you and uh that's
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
all we have for you today happy to take
 
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may have
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
um thanks but uh I have a question that
 
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
you are a banking organization that is
 
01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
regulated federally
 
01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
and by the state
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious as to whether or not you
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
have been doing much business that's
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency related
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and whether or not
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
I've read it from the federal side the
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
Congressional side some concerns about
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
that and I'm just wondering if if I
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
would like to see any information you
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
might have as to your interactions with
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
crypto and uh under whose regulation you
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
might fall under whether it's federal or
 
01:57:25.609 --> 01:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
state in regards to that activity
 
01:57:25.619 --> 01:57:27.430 align:start position:0%
state in regards to that activity
foreign

01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Herbert um
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
so we are a Statewide trade Association
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
a non-profit um but we do monitor
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency very closely obviously
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's heavily debated in Washington
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
um where we stand right now the federal
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
Regulators have all basically said you
 
01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
know before a bank engages in
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency please talk to us first
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
if you're thinking about getting into
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
the space if you want a custody please
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
talk to your Regulators first so that
 
01:57:56.089 --> 01:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
goes for the FDIC the Federal Reserve
 
01:57:58.129 --> 01:57:58.139 align:start position:0%
and the OCC so that sort of have been
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
their position in terms of what our
 
01:58:03.169 --> 01:58:03.179 align:start position:0%
members are hearing about crypto we have
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%
heard some things come up
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
um on the fraud side of things so
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
customers who may have money in a
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
certain type of crypto wallet and then
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
something happens with that wallet and
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
they want the bank to hold them harmless
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
even though the bank really has no
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
purview over the customer's decision to
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
for the customer to put their money into
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
a cryptocurrency wallet they want the
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
bank to to hold them harmless and so
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
there have been some some questions
 
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
around fraud about that but we really
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
have not seen a lot of activity buyer
 
01:58:36.169 --> 01:58:36.179 align:start position:0%
banks in the crypto space I think
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
they're trying to learn more about it
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
what is a regulatory framework and I
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
think ultimately the banks want to be
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
able to support their customers and what
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
it is they want so we can you know a lot
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
of customers trust their Banks and they
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
may want Banks to
 
01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
custody crypto or to offer crypto so I
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
think they want to better understand it
 
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
and be open to the possibility of
 
01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
someday getting in that space and you
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
know in a way that's compliant with
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
everything so I did want to also mention
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
that we had a representative on the
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
governor's cryptocurrency commission as
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
well so we worked with representative
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
Amman and that group through our our
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
I would I would like for you to pay
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
close attention and uh it disturbs me a
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
little that uh
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
this committee really didn't get any
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
information to amount to much in the
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
last session there is a uh there is a
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
report that's coming forward and I'm
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
looking forward to seeing that
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
information but my main concern is
 
01:59:44.689 --> 01:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
the citizens I represent don't end up
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
being on the hook for something that was
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
not foreseen uh and uh
 
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
we passed the legislation so it's in
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
part our responsibility I think to make
 
02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
sure it's good legislation or not
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
we definitely do keep a close eye on
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
that and through the the governor's
 
02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
commission that was certainly one of the
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
things that our banking the banking
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative talked about was consumer
 
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
protection so we agree I think that's
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
really important and
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
um you know you've seen some Regulators
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
come out and say that they're concerned
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
for example the fdaic is that some of
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
these groups are are suggesting that uh
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
crypto certain crypto firms are FDIC
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
insured when they're not and so I think
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
you know customers have to have their
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
eyes open and understand that certain
 
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
products do have FDIC insurance and
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
others don't there are Savvy investors
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the way they want to invest
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
their money and they should be able to
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
um but that consumer protection is top
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
of mind for Bankers thanks
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and just
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
to reiterate um if you all have any
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
questions from constituents about any
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
banking issues please don't hesitate to
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
reach out okay great
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you guys
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
so are you guys doing credit unions
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
who's doing the credit unions now
 
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh okay because I thought
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
all right so I I've somehow placed
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
myself in the worst position of any
 
02:01:17.330 --> 02:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and that's between legislators

02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm with the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
Association we're a trade group for the
 
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle industry in New Hampshire
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
about 500 businesses 14 000 employees uh
 
02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
every corner in every community of the
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
state we are the big Garage Mahal
 
02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
franchise dealerships and where the
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
little independent inspection station
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
and string of light parking lot folks so
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
um we cover the whole industry uh
 
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
franchise and independent
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
um we are regulated by the insurance
 
02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
department who you heard before
 
02:07:09.050 --> 02:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
primarily because a lot of our members
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
are Collision repairs so you may hear
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
from us on collision repair issues
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
Insurance related issues uh it's really
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
a a three-legged stool between the
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
consumer the repairer and the carrier in
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
the uh Collision Repair world and then
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
with the banking Department we were
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
licensed primarily as retail sellers in
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
a few instances where sales finance
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
companies which are the buy here pay
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
here which is when the dealer also acts
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
as the bank but primarily it's as retail
 
02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
sellers so we work very closely
 
02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
with the banking Department
 
02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:42.350 align:start position:0%
with the banking Department

[Music]
 
02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:43.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes too close over the last few
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
months one thing I would like to bring
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
up and and highlight really highlight is
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
as approaching first of the year we had
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
a real licensing scare for a number of
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
retail sellers who potentially had uh
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
licenses that were going to expire due
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
to no fault of their own uh primarily
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
because of a federal IRS related issue
 
02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
Amelia and her team were so pro-business
 
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
so pro-consumer in being solution
 
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
oriented that we reached the first of
 
02:08:16.330 --> 02:08:16.340 align:start position:0%
the year deadline
 
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
there were a few instances where an
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
arrangement was made so that these folks
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
could continue to operate without losing
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
their license some of her staff and I
 
02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
were on the phone at times three to four
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
times a day personally touching
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
businesses uh all over the state the
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
resolution wound up being entirely
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and again I just want to
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
let you know how not just pro-business
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
but also pro-consumer her Department
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um was rolling into first of the year so
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
a real kudos to them
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
um one of the other programs that I want
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
to highlight too and at some point I
 
02:08:54.169 --> 02:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
will drop off for all of you in addition
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
to electronically sending out contact
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
information is a reference to our
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
autocap program and our autocap program
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
is one that resolves conflicts between
 
02:09:07.490 --> 02:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
our members and citizens who may have
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
um difficulty or conflict related to
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
vehicle sales or service a lot of times
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's really just miscommunication I
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know what tires for life really
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
meant or the owner didn't know what one
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
of the salesmen may have said and it may
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
have been an error so through
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
communication and connection we can
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
resolve most issues and it's the reason
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office refers
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
most uh vehicle-related complaints to us
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
to our auto program our autocap program
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
first so the reason that I'm going to
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
give the information for you is that if
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
you have a constituation issue if
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
someone comes to you refer them to us we
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
can help we can help make that
 
02:09:50.089 --> 02:09:50.099 align:start position:0%
connection uh establish and enable that
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
communication so you will see uh you
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
will see us often in this committee uh
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
potentially hear from us as well we do
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
also engage and work with the firm of
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
Dennehy and boulay so you may hear from
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
them as well periodically throughout the
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
session but other than that I just want
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
to introduce myself thank you for the
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
opportunity I look forward to working
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
with you if there's any information at
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
all that we can provide related to the
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle industry business please
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
let us know if we can connect you to one
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
of the local businesses you know in your
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
in your neighborhood in your backyard
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
those really are the true experts right
 
02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
those are the folks that are living and
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
breathing it and doing it every day so
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
we can gladly make those connections
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
um so with that thanks and I'll take any
 
02:10:33.169 --> 02:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
questions if any
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being here
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
um the um collision repair shops there I
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester there are many repair
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
shops and there are many repair shops in
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and I'm not sure
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
um how to get information about the air
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
quality in the neighborhood I guess it
 
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
might be EPA but it just seems like many
 
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
of these collisions small that have been
 
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
around for a long time really should not
 
02:11:06.169 --> 02:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
be operating in these areas because of
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
the you know systems they have in place
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
to clean the air or you know make sure
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
that the surrounding neighborhood is not
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
inundated with
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know air quality that's not
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
sufficient yes so I think I can answer
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
that question for you in two ways one
 
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
important thing about the collision
 
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
repair industry and the emerging
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
technology is that most paint a lot of
 
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
most of the paint that's being used for
 
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
vehicles these days is actually
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
waterborne so those haps called
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
hazardous air pollutants that you're
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
concerned about are actually not no
 
02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
longer in the paints anymore so the the
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
painting process has actually gotten
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
much more environmentally friendly so
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
those potential sources are removed the
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
second part to answer that question is
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction for those operations is
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
strictly under the Department of
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services New Hampshire and
 
02:11:56.689 --> 02:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
their air Resources Division they have
 
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
folks that are dedicated uh through the
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
sbtap Small Business technical
 
02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
assistance program another the acronym
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
of alphabet soups who regulate those
 
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be able to help
 
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
you with that with those concerns yeah
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
just another question about
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
um the the new paints that they're using
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
how can um did they have to uh do they
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
have to use these new paints or or how
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
are they regulated is that EPA or uh
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
Department of environment so the the de
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
yes so the Des doesn't require
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
waterborne paints however most folks are
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
moving towards them
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's as mentioned it's an
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
emerging technology it's a different
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
drying technique as well it requires
 
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
less heat so it's less energy intensive
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
so it's actually a less costly way to
 
02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
paint a vehicle
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so it's dried actually with airflow
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
instead of heat it's not baked any
 
02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
longer but all those paints and those
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
processes are regulated by Des
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay thanks well as long as they don't
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
have pfases in them then it'll be okay
 
02:12:59.810 --> 02:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's paint not bumper and upholstery
 
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's a different section
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much thank you
 
02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.390 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much thank you
Henry

02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
I was gonna wait for liquor for you
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
Henry but you know I
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
but you do other things like dogs at the
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Henry beyou and uh I'm
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
with she Infinity Capital group we are a
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
lobbying firm that represents a variety
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
of clients there are two that get me
 
02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
before this committee uh more often than
 
02:13:32.089 --> 02:13:32.099 align:start position:0%
not and the first is the New Hampshire
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association so
 
02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
all the liquor laws come here
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
Food Service issues come here uh dogs in
 
02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
restaurants come here that's been a
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
popular one over the past several years
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
we've solved that one now yeah but it's
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
a fun industry uh to represent and to
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
work with most of the restaurants in New
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are independently owned so
 
02:13:58.850 --> 02:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
they're your neighbors and you have a
 
02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
lot of they're they're they're all in
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
your districts so they're fun to
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
represent and then I also have the um
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
American Council of Life insurers their
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
trade Association that provides life
 
02:14:12.970 --> 02:14:12.980 align:start position:0%
insurance disability insurance
 
02:14:17.689 --> 02:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
retirement plans long-term care dental
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
vision different kinds of products like
 
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
that they have a bill that they are uh
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
that they have filed for this session
 
02:14:28.729 --> 02:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
and starting in the Senate side it's uh
 
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
what I would consider housekeeping you
 
02:14:33.169 --> 02:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
can be the judges of that hopefully it
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
gets here and we get it to the
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
governor's desk but so I'll be here uh
 
02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
with them on that but
 
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
he's been around a long time so we were
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
talking uh we both started at the same
 
02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
time in 1986 we've both been here 36
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
years is coming up my 37th year and so
 
02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:56.750 align:start position:0%
years is coming up my 37th year and so
yeah

02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
would like to Mr boulay you want to say
 
02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:08.569 align:start position:0%
would like to Mr boulay you want to say
anything

02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's true okay it's all set yeah
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
whatever he said okay great thank you
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
all very much and uh we'll break for
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
lunch and we'll see you all back at 1
 
02:15:19.679 --> 02:15:21.290 align:start position:0%
lunch and we'll see you all back at 1
15.

02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
15.
 
02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
15.
foreign

02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.330 --> 03:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do it that way and the other
 
03:20:22.969 --> 03:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
thing is it's on YouTube
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know run it through like dictation
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
software on YouTube I did that as a
 
03:20:27.779 --> 03:20:28.910 align:start position:0%
software on YouTube I did that as a
backup

03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
backup
 
03:20:30.530 --> 03:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
so I try to get as much as I could here
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
the trick was when question and answer
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
right you got to type in who's saying
 
03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:36.650 align:start position:0%
right you got to type in who's saying
what

03:20:36.650 --> 03:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:20:38.929 --> 03:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
so you have to be good at the
 
03:20:40.929 --> 03:20:40.939 align:start position:0%
there's like shortcuts on the keyboard
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's that was the one thing I was like
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
at least make a note so you could go
 
03:20:47.090 --> 03:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
back and say oh this this is
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative so on so asking that
 
03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
question but it's gonna be a lot of
 
03:20:51.769 --> 03:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
handwritten for me too okay yeah yeah
 
03:20:54.889 --> 03:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
okay I mean
 
03:20:54.899 --> 03:20:56.389 align:start position:0%
okay I mean
but

03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:20:58.849 --> 03:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I got good at that like the second
 
03:21:00.230 --> 03:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
end of the second year I got pretty good
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:57.010 --> 03:28:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we get started
 
03:29:02.330 --> 03:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
better late than never uh attorney
 
03:29:02.340 --> 03:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
better late than never uh attorney
Garrett

03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
Garrett
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't didn't see you behind that
 
03:29:09.190 --> 03:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
speaker he was like where is he
 
03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
where is he
 
03:29:15.170 --> 03:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the Attorney General's office
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
we have two divisions that that uh have
 
03:29:20.090 --> 03:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
we have interests in
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
and how long have you now you've been
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing consumer protection this three
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
four years yeah okay cool
 
03:29:36.650 --> 03:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
great so all I ask is uh holy Mike you
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
know hit the button and pull it close
 
03:29:40.080 --> 03:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
know hit the button and pull it close
right

03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
the red is on yes there we go to
 
03:29:46.130 --> 03:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
everything else yeah great right so
 
03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
think of it as when you're in front of
 
03:29:50.830 --> 03:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
03:29:53.389 --> 03:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's hot hot mic
 
03:29:58.670 --> 03:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:00.530 --> 03:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
ready yes
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
morning every or afternoon everybody my
 
03:30:04.130 --> 03:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
name is Brandon garad I'm the chief of
 
03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and antitrust
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the New Hampshire Department
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
of Justice so I'm going to do two things
 
03:30:12.290 --> 03:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
well I'll do three things for you this
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon let me give you an overview of
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and antitrust
 
03:30:18.889 --> 03:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
Bureau both the makeup of the bureau and
 
03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
the various uh areas of law that we
 
03:30:23.330 --> 03:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
enforce I'm going to highlight for you a
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
couple of things that you will be
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
hearing from me and my staff throughout
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
the year in the in the various bills
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that come up under Consumer Protection
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
Law that'll give an opportunity for
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
anybody to ask any questions that you
 
03:30:37.130 --> 03:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
might have at the end
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
so the Consumer Protection Bureau of the
 
03:30:41.330 --> 03:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office consumer
 
03:30:42.650 --> 03:30:42.660 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau of the
 
03:30:44.570 --> 03:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I believe is
 
03:30:46.490 --> 03:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
the second largest Bureau in the office
 
03:30:49.250 --> 03:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
behind the criminal Bureau and we handle
 
03:30:52.269 --> 03:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
an incredibly diverse body of things
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
at the heart of what we do though is New
 
03:30:57.050 --> 03:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumer protection act
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 358 a it makes it unlawful
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
for anyone in the course of Commerce to
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
engage in unfair or deceptive Acts or
 
03:31:07.020 --> 03:31:08.570 align:start position:0%
engage in unfair or deceptive Acts or
practices

03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
practices
 
03:31:10.849 --> 03:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
the statute gives a number of examples
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
of things that are by definition unfair
 
03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
and deceptive Acts or practices things
 
03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
like representing that a product has
 
03:31:20.929 --> 03:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
specific endorsements when it actually
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those endorsements
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
um things like making a representation
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
that a product you know will produce a
 
03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
certain result when in fact that's not
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
true it also includes an extremely broad
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
catch-all which is anything that meets
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the legal definition of unfair or
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices that's
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
committed in the course of Commerce
 
03:31:44.210 --> 03:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
Falls within our statute so there's two
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
big parts to that the first is it has to
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
be in the course of Commerce so we do
 
03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
not have any authority over private
 
03:31:53.210 --> 03:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
transactions one sale between one person
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
to another uh somebody you know sells
 
03:31:57.830 --> 03:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
their car on Facebook Marketplace we
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
have no Authority
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
um to regulate that sale at all
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
um that's something that you know if
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
somebody made a misrepresentation in the
 
03:32:05.809 --> 03:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
course of that sale that would have to
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
be handled through the private civil
 
03:32:10.250 --> 03:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
courts however if it's in Commerce if
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's a car dealership or you know
 
03:32:14.090 --> 03:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
somebody who has you know regularly
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
contributed to Commerce in the state by
 
03:32:17.929 --> 03:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
making it their business to sell cars
 
03:32:20.809 --> 03:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
that would fall within the purview of
 
03:32:23.090 --> 03:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act so then you
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
have so if it's in the course of
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce the next question is is the
 
03:32:30.170 --> 03:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
practice unfair or deceptive and if it
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the you know number of
 
03:32:35.090 --> 03:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
identified things in the statute or the
 
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
surrounding statutes that are identified
 
03:32:39.650 --> 03:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
as unfair deceptive Acts or practices we
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
have a body of case law that we apply to
 
03:32:43.790 --> 03:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
a scenario to determine whether it rises
 
03:32:45.290 --> 03:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
to the level of something that the
 
03:32:46.729 --> 03:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in the state
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has an interest in
 
03:32:50.570 --> 03:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
investigating and Prosecuting or whether
 
03:32:52.210 --> 03:32:52.220 align:start position:0%
it's something that's more appropriate
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately resolved in civil courts
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
between private parties and I'll spare
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
you the details of you know the legalese
 
03:33:01.070 --> 03:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
that the courts have used to interpret
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
what amounts to an unfair deceptive act
 
03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
or practice what it basically boils down
 
03:33:06.889 --> 03:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
to is there has to be a sufficient level
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
of intentional wrongdoing or intentional
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
deceptiveness by the perpetrator so a
 
03:33:14.330 --> 03:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
simple mistake
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
um would not be a unfair deceptive act
 
03:33:19.130 --> 03:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
or practice a breach of contract you
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
know somebody contracts for somebody to
 
03:33:22.729 --> 03:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
build them a house they start building
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
it then something you know out of the
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
blue comes up contractor walks off the
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
job that's a breach of contract that
 
03:33:30.889 --> 03:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
would be resolved in civil courts but if
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
you have that same case where the
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
contractor makes certain representations
 
03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
to the the customer says if you give me
 
03:33:38.090 --> 03:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
you know this much money up front I'll
 
03:33:39.290 --> 03:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
take it and I'll purchase all your
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
materials I'll get you a great deal then
 
03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
they abscond you never see them again
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we can prove that you know there was
 
03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
a certain level of intentional
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing by that contractor at the
 
03:33:49.490 --> 03:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
point where the commerce was commenced
 
03:33:52.010 --> 03:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's the type of analysis that we do
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
on all the complaints we receive to
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not something is
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of the Consumer
 
03:33:59.330 --> 03:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau to investigate and
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
possibly prosecute under the consumer
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
03:34:04.969 --> 03:34:04.979 align:start position:0%
so the way we review cases and receive
 
03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
cases primarily is through our consumer
 
03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:09.969 align:start position:0%
cases primarily is through our consumer
protection

03:34:09.969 --> 03:34:09.979 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:34:12.889 --> 03:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
complaint submission process you go
 
03:34:14.330 --> 03:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
through our website there's a forum
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
where folks can print or submit an
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
electronic form specifically articulate
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
what they believe a business did that
 
03:34:24.050 --> 03:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
was unfair and deceptive we have a
 
03:34:25.849 --> 03:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
volunteer hotline where people can call
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
in and they get some guidance on how to
 
03:34:29.570 --> 03:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
do that process but what it results do
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
is thousands of complaints each year
 
03:34:33.650 --> 03:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
about businesses in the state that have
 
03:34:35.809 --> 03:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
allegedly engaged in unfair deceptive
 
03:34:38.330 --> 03:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
Acts or practices so our process you
 
03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
know very very generally I review every
 
03:34:42.050 --> 03:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
single one of those complaints in
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
conjunction with various paralegals in
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
the bureau if we believe that based on
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
what the consumer is alleging to us this
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
Rises to the level of assuming it's true
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
an unfair deceptive act or practice we
 
03:34:54.889 --> 03:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
typically send those complaints to the
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
business ask them to respond provide
 
03:34:58.929 --> 03:34:58.939 align:start position:0%
their side of the story in writing
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
businesses often do businesses will
 
03:35:01.739 --> 03:35:02.570 align:start position:0%
businesses often do businesses will
often

03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
often
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
make the situation right at that point
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a simple letter from the
 
03:35:08.090 --> 03:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that tells
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
people you know hey it's the Consumer
 
03:35:11.450 --> 03:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau we received this
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
complaint about unfair and deceptive
 
03:35:14.809 --> 03:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
Acts or practices and we're watching you
 
03:35:16.610 --> 03:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
know give us your side of the story that
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
results in an enormous amount of
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
consumer restitution each year
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
which is terrific when it works out that
 
03:35:24.410 --> 03:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
way unfortunately there's a number of
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
times when it doesn't work out that way
 
03:35:27.469 --> 03:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
we either get no response from the
 
03:35:29.570 --> 03:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
business or we'll get a less than
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
satisfactory response from the business
 
03:35:35.450 --> 03:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
we have certain tools under the consumer
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
protection act that we then use to
 
03:35:39.290 --> 03:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
enforce our statute we have a subpoena
 
03:35:42.769 --> 03:35:42.779 align:start position:0%
power where we can compel Witnesses we
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
can compel documents we can even compel
 
03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
the business themselves to come to the
 
03:35:48.410 --> 03:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office place them
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
under oath ask them a series of
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions in order to investigate
 
03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
whether the consumer's claims are
 
03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
accurate and decide whether or not we
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
can prove that the act or practice that
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
the consumers alleging actually Rises to
 
03:36:01.309 --> 03:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
that level of unfair deceptive
 
03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
if it is we have a number of enforcement
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
Options under our statute we have a
 
03:36:09.290 --> 03:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
criminal enforcement statute for the
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
most severe unfair and deceptive Acts or
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
practices it's a misdemeanor if we bring
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
it against an individual it is a felony
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
if we bring it against a business the
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
difference between bringing a crime
 
03:36:22.010 --> 03:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
against a business versus an individual
 
03:36:23.570 --> 03:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
if it's an individual they're subject to
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
jail time if it's a business they are
 
03:36:28.010 --> 03:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
subject to a fine of up to a hundred
 
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:36:33.410 --> 03:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
if the so you know we we bring criminal
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
actions routinely but we tend to reserve
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
them for the most serious offenses it's
 
03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
a less serious offense we feel that we
 
03:36:41.929 --> 03:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
can prove it or the evidence doesn't
 
03:36:43.370 --> 03:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
quite rise to the level of a criminal
 
03:36:46.010 --> 03:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
offense we also have the power to file a
 
03:36:47.570 --> 03:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
lawsuit on behalf of the State of New
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire against the business we have
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
the power to ask the court to do a
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
number of things the first is to order
 
03:36:56.030 --> 03:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
any injunctive relief that is necessary
 
03:36:58.010 --> 03:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the unfair deceptive
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
actual practice stops usually it's a
 
03:37:01.849 --> 03:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
court order that orders the practice to
 
03:37:03.410 --> 03:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
stop sometimes it can be a court order
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
putting the business out of business or
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know limiting their business so that
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
sufficient consumer protections are in
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that consumers in the
 
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
future are protected a great example of
 
03:37:15.410 --> 03:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
this is if you have a contractor who's
 
03:37:18.110 --> 03:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
taking deposits from people a court can
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
order that they're no longer allowed to
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
take deposits so they might be able to
 
03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
continue working but you're able to
 
03:37:24.530 --> 03:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
alleviate the risk to Future consumers
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
through a court order that says you know
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
for a certain period of time you're no
 
03:37:29.690 --> 03:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
longer allowed to take payments in
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
advance things like that
 
03:37:34.250 --> 03:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
so we get injunctive relief we also have
 
03:37:37.130 --> 03:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
the ability to get a civil penalty of up
 
03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand dollars per violation we
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to get restitution for
 
03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
victims and we also have the ability to
 
03:37:45.849 --> 03:37:45.859 align:start position:0%
recover our own
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and investigative costs
 
03:37:50.570 --> 03:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
that are associated with conducting the
 
03:37:50.580 --> 03:37:52.309 align:start position:0%
that are associated with conducting the
investigation

03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:37:52.319 --> 03:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
investigation
and

03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
um the third option that we have this is
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
for you know first-time offenders or you
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
know cases where we look at something
 
03:38:02.450 --> 03:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
and we see you know it's a it's a
 
03:38:04.190 --> 03:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
serious offense but it's on the very
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
very minor end of the spectrum from like
 
03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
you know this person needs to be in jail
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
to oh this person just made a mistake
 
03:38:13.849 --> 03:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
and you know it is sorry and is willing
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
to work it out and take responsibility
 
03:38:16.969 --> 03:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
we can file what's called an assurance
 
03:38:19.130 --> 03:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
of discontinuance it's basically a
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
promise that's enforceable and filed
 
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
with the court between the business and
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
us and we can put whatever terms we want
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
into that Assurance of discontinuance
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
can account for restitution can it
 
03:38:30.650 --> 03:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
account for financial penalties and can
 
03:38:32.929 --> 03:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
also bake in injunctive terms into that
 
03:38:34.729 --> 03:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh the difference is the the business
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually get sued doesn't have a
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
lawsuit filed against them doesn't have
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
a judgment against them so this was a
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
big incentive for them to resolve things
 
03:38:43.849 --> 03:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
through a Assurance of discontinuance
 
03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
that way that is how we investigate and
 
03:38:48.410 --> 03:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
prosecute the majority of our consumer
 
03:38:49.849 --> 03:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
protection cases
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh the consumer protection act is
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
designed so that the enforcement for it
 
03:38:57.769 --> 03:38:57.779 align:start position:0%
is shared it's not all the Attorney
 
03:39:00.349 --> 03:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
General's office uh private citizens
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
also have the ability specifically to
 
03:39:05.090 --> 03:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
file a private right of action under 358
 
03:39:07.370 --> 03:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
a almost anything that we could bring in
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
action for they could bring in action
 
03:39:11.170 --> 03:39:11.180 align:start position:0%
for it the remedies are just different
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
they can't get you know civil penalties
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
they can't bring Criminal action but
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
they can get injunctive terms and they
 
03:39:21.170 --> 03:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
can also get damages depending on the
 
03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
level of the mental state that they can
 
03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
prove they can also get double or
 
03:39:26.510 --> 03:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes triple damages which is
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
something that we don't have the ability
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
to get so there's actually an incentive
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
for consumers to bring these cases on
 
03:39:33.769 --> 03:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
their own and share that burden of
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement with the Attorney General's
 
03:39:37.010 --> 03:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
office because as I'll talk about in a
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
minute we have limited resources in our
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
Bureau where it forces us to only take
 
03:39:43.490 --> 03:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
the most serious cases but we do try to
 
03:39:45.410 --> 03:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
do as much as possible
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's our Consumer Protection work the
 
03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
bureau also does a number of other
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
things so it's consumer protection and
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau so I'll talk a little
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
bit about our antitrust enforcement
 
03:39:57.530 --> 03:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
there's a separate Statute in New
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 356
 
03:40:02.809 --> 03:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
which is our antitrust statute it makes
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
it unlawful for businesses uh businesses
 
03:40:08.330 --> 03:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
that have Monopoly power to abuse that
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
Monopoly power in a way that limits
 
03:40:12.769 --> 03:40:12.779 align:start position:0%
competition or two businesses to decide
 
03:40:15.410 --> 03:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
to come together uh to merge or for one
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
business to acquire another business in
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
a way that significantly harms
 
03:40:20.809 --> 03:40:20.819 align:start position:0%
competition in the state of New
 
03:40:22.969 --> 03:40:22.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if we have complaints about
 
03:40:25.010 --> 03:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
a business that has a potential Monopoly
 
03:40:26.929 --> 03:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
power that is you know abusing it in a
 
03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
way that harms consumers we can
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
investigate that if you have two
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that are merging or one
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
businesses buying another
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
our antitrust Bureau is very busy in
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
reviewing those proposed transactions to
 
03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
determine whether on the other side of
 
03:40:41.690 --> 03:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
that and you have one corporate entity
 
03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
whether that will be harmful for
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
consumers because now there's less
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
choice in the market there's less
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
competition and there's less incentive
 
03:40:51.769 --> 03:40:51.779 align:start position:0%
to keep prices low
 
03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
that statute similar to the consumer
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
protection act statute has both civil
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
and criminal penalties we tend to use
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
the Civil remedies much more I I don't
 
03:41:02.330 --> 03:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
believe we've used the criminal remedies
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
in quite some time but the possibility
 
03:41:06.290 --> 03:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
is always there
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
the bureau has a separate elder abuse
 
03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
and financial exploitation unit this is
 
03:41:16.130 --> 03:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
one lawyer one victim witness Advocate
 
03:41:19.610 --> 03:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
and a Elder coordinator specialist and
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
they are tasked with overseeing
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
investigating and Prosecuting the most
 
03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
serious cases of Elder Financial abuse
 
03:41:28.729 --> 03:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
and neglect in the state of New
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they also work with the police
 
03:41:32.809 --> 03:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
department's county attorney's offices
 
03:41:35.090 --> 03:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
Adult Protective Services to make sure
 
03:41:37.610 --> 03:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
that if there are cases out there of
 
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
adults be Elder adults being scammed
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
abused neglected or even you know
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
harming themselves that we're providing
 
03:41:45.650 --> 03:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
education and a resource to make sure
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
that those cases are all dealt with
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that those
 
03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
perpetrators are brought to justice so
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's Bureau is a
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
purely criminal Bureau they take the
 
03:41:57.889 --> 03:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
most serious cases in the state of Elder
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation as well as
 
03:42:01.849 --> 03:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
criminal neglect
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
the bureau is also tasked with the
 
03:42:09.050 --> 03:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
registration of health clubs and martial
 
03:42:11.450 --> 03:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
arts studios on an annual basis there
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
are various consumer protection laws in
 
03:42:14.929 --> 03:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
the state where if you are running a
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
health club or a martial arts studio
 
03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're required to file an annual
 
03:42:20.929 --> 03:42:20.939 align:start position:0%
registration with our Bureau to prove
 
03:42:22.370 --> 03:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
that you're complying with all those
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
laws the most important and this is the
 
03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
reason that health clubs in martial arts
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
studios are regulated At All by the
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is that it's a
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
business that lends itself to signing
 
03:42:36.530 --> 03:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
people up in advance for services that
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to receive in the future a
 
03:42:40.010 --> 03:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
lot of health clubs martial arts studios
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
their business model is to sell at a
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
reduced price the ability to sign up for
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
their services for a whole year or for
 
03:42:48.910 --> 03:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
six months or for a long period of time
 
03:42:51.170 --> 03:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
and you know the question is what
 
03:42:53.090 --> 03:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
happens to those consumers if the
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
business doesn't exist you know for the
 
03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
duration of that contract so there are
 
03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
laws where the health clubs are required
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
to provide to us
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
um proof that they are complying with
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
various consumer protection laws most
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
importantly if they are accepting
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
um prepaid contracts selling services in
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
advance of when folks are going to
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
receive them if they're doing enough of
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
that they're required to obtain a surety
 
03:43:20.330 --> 03:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
bond that bond is filed with our office
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
and if the club were to go out of
 
03:43:24.110 --> 03:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
business and there were still contracts
 
03:43:25.490 --> 03:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
that had to be honored the consumers
 
03:43:26.809 --> 03:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
would be protected they'd be able to
 
03:43:28.190 --> 03:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
draw on that Bond and they'd be able to
 
03:43:30.290 --> 03:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
receive a refund
 
03:43:33.969 --> 03:43:33.979 align:start position:0%
the bureau also oversees condominium
 
03:43:37.090 --> 03:43:37.100 align:start position:0%
registrations and
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
subdivision initial
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh disclosure initial sales of land
 
03:43:43.439 --> 03:43:45.290 align:start position:0%
uh disclosure initial sales of land
subdivisions

03:43:45.290 --> 03:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so our role in this is pretty much
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
limited to for both condos and
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions the initial sale of a of a
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
condominium or subdivision units or lots
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
to the public they're similar to health
 
03:44:00.650 --> 03:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
clubs there are a number of consumer
 
03:44:03.290 --> 03:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
protection laws that we have to review
 
03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
and approve that before the sale can
 
03:44:07.790 --> 03:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
take place make sure the consumers are
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
getting full disclosure about what
 
03:44:10.849 --> 03:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
they're going to receive if they buy
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
into a condominium or they buy into a
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision that the disclosures that
 
03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
are being made to them about what's
 
03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
actually going to be included you know
 
03:44:21.530 --> 03:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
roads water things like that they
 
03:44:23.450 --> 03:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
actually have the money to live up to
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
those promises
 
03:44:28.849 --> 03:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
we review those we issue initial
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
registration once the Condominiums are
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
you know established and they elect a
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
board of directors and there's various
 
03:44:39.290 --> 03:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
issues that arise between the owners and
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
the board we tend to not get involved in
 
03:44:44.290 --> 03:44:44.300 align:start position:0%
those matters unless they are you know
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
serious enough that it rises to the
 
03:44:47.630 --> 03:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
level of the Attorney General's office
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
being involved those matters are usually
 
03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
left for resolution between unit owners
 
03:44:54.530 --> 03:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the condominium boards we see them
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
as self-governing entities they that's
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
the purpose of them you could buy in
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's a democratic process you have a
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
vote you can elect a board and the board
 
03:45:04.490 --> 03:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
speaks for the condo and so therefore
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
the the remedy that folks tend to have
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
is to vote out the board of directors if
 
03:45:09.769 --> 03:45:09.779 align:start position:0%
they don't think they're doing a good
 
03:45:09.779 --> 03:45:11.450 align:start position:0%
they don't think they're doing a good
job

03:45:11.450 --> 03:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
so that in a nutshell is the body of
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
work that the consumer protection
 
03:45:19.330 --> 03:45:19.340 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau is responsible for
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
at least by Statute the reality is that
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
we also take on a number of serious
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
criminal matters
 
03:45:28.969 --> 03:45:28.979 align:start position:0%
um that are referred to us by the
 
03:45:30.530 --> 03:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
banking Department the Bureau of
 
03:45:31.969 --> 03:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation who I think you're
 
03:45:33.710 --> 03:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
going to hear from later and the
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
department of insurance we also do if a
 
03:45:39.769 --> 03:45:39.779 align:start position:0%
case you know looks like an unfair and
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
deceptive act or practice like we said
 
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
if it's against an individual I'll keep
 
03:45:45.769 --> 03:45:45.779 align:start position:0%
using contractors because it's our most
 
03:45:48.769 --> 03:45:48.779 align:start position:0%
constant source of complaints an unfair
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
and deceptive Act of practice is only a
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor against a contractor if it's
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
an individual we also have General
 
03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
criminal authority to prosecute those
 
03:46:00.050 --> 03:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
cases as felonies if they meet the the
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
all the elements of those crimes so we
 
03:46:03.410 --> 03:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
tend to bring a lot of serious
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud cases theft by
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking cases step by
 
03:46:09.290 --> 03:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
misapplication of property cases theft
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
by deception cases large criminal
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutions that include unfair and
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices but are
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
expanded to include other violations of
 
03:46:19.370 --> 03:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
the RSA because the penalties are much
 
03:46:19.380 --> 03:46:21.229 align:start position:0%
the RSA because the penalties are much
higher

03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:46:24.670 --> 03:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the work that the bureau does
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are in terms of bills that you're
 
03:46:28.969 --> 03:46:28.979 align:start position:0%
going to see and what you can expect to
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
hear from me and my staff throughout
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
this session and you're going to hear
 
03:46:34.849 --> 03:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
from one of them on Thursday for a bill
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not available but one
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
of our lawyers is going to come talk to
 
03:46:38.340 --> 03:46:39.130 align:start position:0%
of our lawyers is going to come talk to
you

03:46:39.130 --> 03:46:39.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:46:42.290 --> 03:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's really two issues where there
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
are bills and there are bills every year
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
where the consumer protection act is
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
expanded to include new conduct or there
 
03:46:52.250 --> 03:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
are new areas where the legislature is
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
considering delegating a responsibility
 
03:46:55.729 --> 03:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
to the consumer protection antitrust
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau for enforcement and the one that
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear most consistently
 
03:47:01.450 --> 03:47:01.460 align:start position:0%
from me is resources
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
as you can see by you know what I've
 
03:47:07.190 --> 03:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
given you today is just a nutshell we
 
03:47:08.690 --> 03:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
have five lawyers that do Consumer
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
Protection work two lawyers that do
 
03:47:12.050 --> 03:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
antitrust work and one lawyer that does
 
03:47:14.990 --> 03:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
elder abuse work and each one of them is
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
about at capacity we try to take
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
everything that we can but each time
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
that the statute is expanded it merits a
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
consideration of resources because every
 
03:47:25.150 --> 03:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
every time the bureau's work goes up
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
caseloads go up expectations go up and
 
03:47:29.690 --> 03:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we can
 
03:47:31.250 --> 03:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
continue to operate at the highest
 
03:47:32.809 --> 03:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
possible level to hold these
 
03:47:34.849 --> 03:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
perpetrators accountable but you know as
 
03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
the statute gets expanded more and more
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
stuff is you know added to it we tend to
 
03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
come over and have the conversation
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
about resources to give you an idea of
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
you know realistically is the thing that
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
you're proposing adding something that
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
we could
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
fulfilled with the resources we have or
 
03:47:51.410 --> 03:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
whether it would be something that would
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
require more
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
so that's something that you can expect
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
to hear from us this year uh the second
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
thing is enforceability
 
03:48:01.370 --> 03:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
so when
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
the con the consumer protection act is
 
03:48:07.610 --> 03:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
amended or added to or there's any other
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
conduct in Commerce the the legislature
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
wants to make unlawful a priority for me
 
03:48:15.769 --> 03:48:15.779 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to be the one enforcing it
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
is making sure that I'm communicating to
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature if I see any issues with
 
03:48:23.210 --> 03:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
enforceability because it's important at
 
03:48:24.769 --> 03:48:24.779 align:start position:0%
this juncture to make sure that the
 
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
language is such that on the other side
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
of it when it becomes law in the state
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that our Bureau is in a
 
03:48:31.490 --> 03:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
position to actually do what you want us
 
03:48:33.650 --> 03:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
to do be able to enforce this thing to
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
investigate these and to prosecute these
 
03:48:38.170 --> 03:48:38.180 align:start position:0%
successfully and sometimes there are
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies or ambiguities in the
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
statute or there's a question of how we
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
would enforce it how we would be able to
 
03:48:46.370 --> 03:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
investigate it we tend to be here to
 
03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
testify and bring those issues to your
 
03:48:48.359 --> 03:48:49.550 align:start position:0%
testify and bring those issues to your
attention

03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
attention
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's generally all I came prepared
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
to talk to you all about today I look
 
03:48:55.849 --> 03:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
forward I know I won't see you on
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
Thursday I'll see you a number of times
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
throughout this legislative session I
 
03:49:00.889 --> 03:49:00.899 align:start position:0%
look forward to to speaking with all of
 
03:49:02.210 --> 03:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
you and answering any questions you have
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and also right now
 
03:49:06.889 --> 03:49:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed your name my name is
 
03:49:15.170 --> 03:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
Brandon garad g-a-r-o-d
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um your director of consumer
 
03:49:19.849 --> 03:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
protection yes and I have a suggestion
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
to avoid interrupting actually I was
 
03:49:24.410 --> 03:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
trying to look up the name of the
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
director of the consumer protection
 
03:49:28.610 --> 03:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
online but
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's not your name is not on the edgy
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
website as far as I could find it
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I my suggestion would be to have the
 
03:49:38.330 --> 03:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
name of the director consumer protection
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows who's
 
03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:41.110 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows who's
responsible

03:49:41.110 --> 03:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think that is a very fair suggestion I
 
03:49:45.650 --> 03:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
will note that the Department of Justice
 
03:49:47.090 --> 03:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
is currently going through a complete
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
overhaul of our website and I have been
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
tasked with rewriting the consumer
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
protection page so I think that's a very
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
good suggestion I will take it into
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
account yeah and so you're Brian gerott
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
j-a-r-o-t Brandon Brandon garage so you
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
you'll email all the committee members
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can you do house Commerce if you can
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
just email all of us with your contact
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
information sure that'd be great but in
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
general the department uh is always been
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's about the hotline the consumer
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
protection hotline so they have not so
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
much giving the calls directly to you
 
03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:21.889 align:start position:0%
much giving the calls directly to you
because

03:50:21.889 --> 03:50:21.899 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
he he screens his calls because he
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to get any any fake phone
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
calls we've learned that in past
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
hearings so always happy to take phone
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
calls it's always good to know he's on
 
03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
the other side exactly so uh so yeah
 
03:50:39.290 --> 03:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
he's sending us that information should
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
be great representative Yemen
 
03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
testifying of course uh I had a question
 
03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:48.170 align:start position:0%
testifying of course uh I had a question
um

03:50:48.170 --> 03:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
are there any instances where uh there
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be a class action taken let's say
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's a contractor who's doing the
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
same thing to multiple people around the
 
03:50:57.889 --> 03:50:57.899 align:start position:0%
state and maybe some of those people
 
03:51:00.170 --> 03:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
don't even know that it was done to them
 
03:51:03.889 --> 03:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
is there any class action enforcement
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
so the consumer protection act includes
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
the ability for class action lawsuits
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to note that
 
03:51:13.610 --> 03:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
a true class action lawsuit is one is a
 
03:51:16.190 --> 03:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
civil lawsuit brought on behalf of a
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
larger class it's a private civil remedy
 
03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office doesn't
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to bring a class action
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but what you're referring to a
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
situation where multiple consumers are
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
harmed by the same person that is
 
03:51:31.610 --> 03:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
something that almost exclusively that's
 
03:51:33.290 --> 03:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
what we look at when I say you know
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at the most serious
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
cases it's the ones that are affecting
 
03:51:39.290 --> 03:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
multiple people and we have the ability
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
to bring an unfair and deceptive actor
 
03:51:43.010 --> 03:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
practices either a criminal case or a
 
03:51:45.410 --> 03:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
civil case and to name multiple victims
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
in that it's not a traditional class
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
action so to speak but all the rights
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
and remedies that I talked about earlier
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
we can get that for multiple people in
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
one civil complaint or through multiple
 
03:51:59.809 --> 03:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.450 --> 03:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:52:05.150 --> 03:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:05.160 --> 03:52:05.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:08.690 --> 03:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
we had a few bills last year regarding
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
um condominium associations
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh and uh there it seems to be a trend I
 
03:52:19.729 --> 03:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
know in Manchester for Manchester where
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
the managers of this of the condominium
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
associations or the you know the
 
03:52:25.920 --> 03:52:27.410 align:start position:0%
associations or the you know the
property

03:52:27.410 --> 03:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
um needs to be addressed before the
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
board is addressed so the Association
 
03:52:34.729 --> 03:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
members are not able to speak to board
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
members they have to address their
 
03:52:39.170 --> 03:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
problem their issues to with managers
 
03:52:43.130 --> 03:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
and not the board are you involved with
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
any of those issues so part of the
 
03:52:48.410 --> 03:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
Condominium Act and part of our
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
registration process they have to pass
 
03:52:53.950 --> 03:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
bylaws we review the bylaws initially
 
03:52:56.450 --> 03:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
but once the bylaws are put into effect
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
the bylaws control the process for the
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
individual condominium they have the
 
03:53:02.090 --> 03:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
ability to decide what their own process
 
03:53:04.849 --> 03:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
is and so we don't get involved in you
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
know help telling people how they should
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
write bylaws that's the responsibility
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
we look at it from the initial you know
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
the this is what's going to be disclosed
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
to Consumers this is what people are
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
buying into and if it complies with law
 
03:53:19.190 --> 03:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
we register them if they want to change
 
03:53:21.410 --> 03:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
bylaws later on then they have to vote
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
for it and approve it as part of a
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
democratic process of being in a
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
condominium so it all depends on the
 
03:53:28.010 --> 03:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
individual condominium if that's the
 
03:53:29.330 --> 03:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
process that they voted on and
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated in their bylaws then that's
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
what they have to comply with and if
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
it's not in their bylaws then
 
03:53:38.570 --> 03:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
very extensive Condominium Act that lays
 
03:53:41.330 --> 03:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
out you know various requirements a lot
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
of it defers to the bylaws we also have
 
03:53:46.190 --> 03:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
published rules for Condominiums so a
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
combination of the the bylaws and the
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
rules it would but it would depend on
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
the specific situation yep okay thank
 
03:53:51.600 --> 03:53:55.729 align:start position:0%
the specific situation yep okay thank
you

03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you all
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
that was very impressive I think you
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
covered it all I think so
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
okay so the other uh element of the
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is a
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division
 
03:54:10.439 --> 03:54:11.809 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division
and

03:54:11.809 --> 03:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
attorney Garrett I so this is another
 
03:54:16.150 --> 03:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
one that I picked up over over time
 
03:54:19.250 --> 03:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
terrible trust uh statutes all the bills
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
used to all go to go to Judiciary and uh
 
03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:24.710 align:start position:0%
used to all go to go to Judiciary and uh
um

03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
not sure which which bill I was a as a
 
03:54:31.729 --> 03:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
star on that but but uh he he has a
 
03:54:33.769 --> 03:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
Terry Knowles who was running the
 
03:54:38.570 --> 03:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
division for a very long time and uh she
 
03:54:40.729 --> 03:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
um was made sure all those bills came to
 
03:54:40.739 --> 03:54:41.710 align:start position:0%
um was made sure all those bills came to
here

03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
so welcome to the Commerce Committee no
 
03:54:46.729 --> 03:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman um good
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone my name is Michael
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
Haley I am the assistant director of
 
03:54:52.010 --> 03:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
charitable trust the director
 
03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was not able to make it
 
03:54:53.580 --> 03:54:54.830 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was not able to make it
today

03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:54:56.929 --> 03:54:56.939 align:start position:0%
um I've been with the Attorney General's
 
03:54:59.689 --> 03:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
office since August of 2020 and I've
 
03:55:01.490 --> 03:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
been in the charitable trust unit since
 
03:55:03.889 --> 03:55:03.899 align:start position:0%
August of this year so I'm relatively
 
03:55:05.630 --> 03:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
new um bear with me have you met Terry
 
03:55:08.450 --> 03:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
yet uh yes yeah we did not overlap but I
 
03:55:10.969 --> 03:55:10.979 align:start position:0%
had mattered
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so I'm gonna follow a similar pattern
 
03:55:15.229 --> 03:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
to attorney Gerard
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
um basically give you an overview of
 
03:55:20.030 --> 03:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
what our unit does and then um what who
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
we're composed of and then give you an
 
03:55:23.929 --> 03:55:23.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask some questions
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so the regulation of charitable
 
03:55:28.010 --> 03:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
trusts by the Office of the Attorney
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
General is a very old tradition in the
 
03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
common law it goes back to 1601 under
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
the reign of Elizabeth the first so
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're to create a dedicated charitable
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
trust unit is the state of New Hampshire
 
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
so that happened in 1943 so we have big
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
shoes to fill and we take that
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
um that responsibility very seriously
 
03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
um our mission is to protect the
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
Public's interest in the assets and
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
organizations that are dedicated to
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes in the state of New
 
03:55:57.960 --> 03:55:59.330 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes in the state of New
Hampshire

03:55:59.330 --> 03:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and so uh you probably have the first
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
question is what is a charity our
 
03:56:07.370 --> 03:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
statute defines a charity to be any
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
entity that is a 501c3 under
 
03:56:13.450 --> 03:56:13.460 align:start position:0%
um the federal IRS Internal Revenue code
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
or any organization that is soliciting
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
charitable donations from the general
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
public so even some entities that are
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
not 501 c3s if they are collecting
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
charitable donations from the general
 
03:56:27.250 --> 03:56:27.260 align:start position:0%
public they fall under our jurisdiction
 
03:56:29.929 --> 03:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
some instances where that happens so for
 
03:56:29.939 --> 03:56:30.830 align:start position:0%
some instances where that happens so for
example

03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
um like a fraternal organizations like
 
03:56:34.969 --> 03:56:34.979 align:start position:0%
an Elks Club they are a membership
 
03:56:37.490 --> 03:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
organization they are not organized for
 
03:56:39.650 --> 03:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes but sometimes they
 
03:56:41.689 --> 03:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
will solicit charitable donations from
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
the general public rather than just from
 
03:56:45.170 --> 03:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
their members and when they do that they
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
fall under our jurisdiction
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
they're required to register with us and
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so one of our main duties is to
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
establish a register of charitable
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
trusts all of the Charities that operate
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire whether
 
03:57:05.450 --> 03:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
they are organized here or organized
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and simply are active here
 
03:57:10.030 --> 03:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
have to register with our office
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
at the time when they register there's a
 
03:57:14.990 --> 03:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of things they have to provide to
 
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
us such as their bylaws their 501c3
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
determination letter we review all those
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
things very carefully when they come in
 
03:57:24.590 --> 03:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we set them off on the
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
right foot we recognize that Charities
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
do an incredible amount of very
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
important work in the state we're more
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
or less agnostic to the purpose that the
 
03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
charity does we think that the Charities
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
um that it's important that they are
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
healthy and functional so when they
 
03:57:42.050 --> 03:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
register with us we review their
 
03:57:43.370 --> 03:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
documents really carefully to make sure
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be successful in
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
achieving their charitable mission
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
um most of the documents that they
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
provide to us are public knowledge
 
03:57:57.010 --> 03:57:57.020 align:start position:0%
they're publicly available the register
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
including their their financial
 
03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:00.229 align:start position:0%
including their their financial
documents

03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
documents
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
um that's all available to the public
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
because Charities are meant to serve the
 
03:58:05.809 --> 03:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
public so that information should be
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
available there's some exemptions to
 
03:58:11.570 --> 03:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
that such as the home addresses and
 
03:58:13.250 --> 03:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
contact information of board members
 
03:58:15.650 --> 03:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
those are not public information but in
 
03:58:17.210 --> 03:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
general if you're curious about a
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
charity what they're spending their
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
money on things like that you can you
 
03:58:23.929 --> 03:58:23.939 align:start position:0%
can get that information from us
 
03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
um we also publish a directory of
 
03:58:29.330 --> 03:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
Charities that's available on our web
 
03:58:31.610 --> 03:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
page and it just is a full list of all
 
03:58:32.809 --> 03:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
the Charities that are registered with
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
us and whether they are in good standing
 
03:58:38.689 --> 03:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
with us if they are not in good standing
 
03:58:40.490 --> 03:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a third
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
designation called suspended which
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
sounds bad but it actually just means
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
that they're a very small organization
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
that has applied to be to suspend their
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements with us for a
 
03:58:53.090 --> 03:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
period of five years especially if
 
03:58:55.010 --> 03:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're something if they're a five
 
03:58:57.349 --> 03:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a year organization it's
 
03:58:59.450 --> 03:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit taxing for them to have to
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
submit annual reports all the time so
 
03:59:03.050 --> 03:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
they can apply to suspend so if you look
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
at the list and you see suspended it
 
03:59:06.050 --> 03:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a bad thing you can still
 
03:59:08.269 --> 03:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
feel confident feel comfortable donating
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
to that charity
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
um another big thing that we do is um
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're aware most of the
 
03:59:18.530 --> 03:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers in the state of New
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are non-profits there are a
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
few exceptions but all the big names are
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
our non-profit organizations and when
 
03:59:26.640 --> 03:59:27.650 align:start position:0%
our non-profit organizations and when
they

03:59:27.650 --> 03:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
um engage in what's called an
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
acquisition transaction which is more
 
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
colloquial thought of as a merger or an
 
03:59:36.370 --> 03:59:36.380 align:start position:0%
acquisition we review that transaction
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
and what we're reviewing for mostly is
 
03:59:42.290 --> 03:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that when a a hospital
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
or another type of healthcare
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
organization agrees to be acquired by
 
03:59:49.370 --> 03:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
some other entity that their board has
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
engaged in due diligence that they've
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
selected their acquirer carefully that
 
03:59:55.010 --> 03:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
they are making sure that the
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
acquisition is in the best interest of
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
the community and of the organization we
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
want don't want these Healthcare
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
organizations to be bought up and
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
stripped for parts when they're playing
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
a very important role in keeping New
 
04:00:09.530 --> 04:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Healthy so we review that we
 
04:00:11.929 --> 04:00:11.939 align:start position:0%
make sure that but if there are
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
charitable assets that are being
 
04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
exchanged that they're being exchanged
 
04:00:17.450 --> 04:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
for fair value there are a number of
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
other factors that we'll go through and
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
we currently have three of those
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
transactions that we're looking at right
 
04:00:22.680 --> 04:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
transactions that we're looking at right
now

04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
um Healthcare charitable trusts are also
 
04:00:30.410 --> 04:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
required every five years at least to
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
put together a community needs
 
04:00:34.729 --> 04:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
assessment often they will work with
 
04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
other health care organizations in their
 
04:00:40.729 --> 04:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
areas to come up with these and then
 
04:00:43.130 --> 04:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
every year they're required to file a
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
community benefits plan which basically
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
tells the public how far along they are
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
in addressing those Community needs and
 
04:00:52.849 --> 04:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
what their plan is to continue to
 
04:00:55.130 --> 04:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
achieve those they can update their
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
their Community needs assessment more
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
often than five years but that's the the
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
minimum and then they provide us with
 
04:01:02.210 --> 04:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
their updates every year we post all of
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
those on our website so you're welcome
 
04:01:06.769 --> 04:01:06.779 align:start position:0%
to go and see how all these charitable
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
trusts or Healthcare charitable trusts
 
04:01:10.490 --> 04:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
are doing in their addressing of
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
community needs there
 
04:01:15.469 --> 04:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
um we also register professional
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
fundraisers and fundraising Council
 
04:01:21.050 --> 04:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
many of you may have received a call at
 
04:01:23.330 --> 04:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
home from someone saying I'm raising
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
money for veterans would you like to
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
give a donation
 
04:01:30.010 --> 04:01:30.020 align:start position:0%
um we uh a lot of um of charitable
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
organizations engage with these these
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
call centers essentially who will
 
04:01:38.929 --> 04:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
solicit donations on their behalf and
 
04:01:41.450 --> 04:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's legal we can't stop them
 
04:01:43.969 --> 04:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
from Contracting to do that we want to
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
make sure however that when people make
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
those donations they know what
 
04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
percentage of Their donation is going to
 
04:01:51.650 --> 04:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
the charity and what percentage is going
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
to the person who's making the call so
 
04:01:56.450 --> 04:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
we um they're required to report that
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
information to us we make that publicly
 
04:02:00.290 --> 04:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
available so if you receive one of those
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
calls we encourage people to look on our
 
04:02:05.330 --> 04:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
website see what the arrangement is and
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
if you if you think that it's better
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
that you just give directly to the
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
charity that you you make that decision
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh we also work on what's called
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
commercial co-ventures and charitable
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
sales promotions you may have seen uh
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
especially with the um the conflict in
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Ukraine recently you've gone to
 
04:02:27.469 --> 04:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
maybe a restaurant and they say uh for
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
every beer you purchase one dollar will
 
04:02:32.090 --> 04:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
go towards towards Ukraine
 
04:02:34.130 --> 04:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
um the restaurant is not a charitable
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
nonprofit so typically they will they
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
will have to contract with a non-profit
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and they are raising money on their
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
behalf we'll review that contract and
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that that it meets the
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
standards that are laid out in the
 
04:02:45.720 --> 04:02:48.349 align:start position:0%
standards that are laid out in the
statute

04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh we don't have very much
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
involvement with the um with the
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
04:02:58.490 --> 04:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
um that's mostly handled by The Lottery
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
Commission however if uh and a charity
 
04:03:04.370 --> 04:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
is required to register with us as in
 
04:03:05.450 --> 04:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
they're not one of those fraternal
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
organizations that's not required then
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
they have to be in good standing with us
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for charitable
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
gaming so that's our our interaction
 
04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
with them we'll see uh typically the
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
charitable uh sorry the the Lottery
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
Commission will just have to look at our
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
list and see if someone is in good
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
standing before they'll permit them to
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
have a license and they may be some back
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
and forth if we have if they're not in
 
04:03:31.250 --> 04:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
um we do also collaborate with the um
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
with the criminal Bureau we'll
 
04:03:37.370 --> 04:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the consumer protection
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
any trust under some circumstances if
 
04:03:41.330 --> 04:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's some Crossover with those two
 
04:03:41.340 --> 04:03:43.010 align:start position:0%
there's some Crossover with those two
things

04:03:43.010 --> 04:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:03:43.020 --> 04:03:44.349 align:start position:0%
things
um

04:03:44.349 --> 04:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:47.929 --> 04:03:47.939 align:start position:0%
and then uh the other large
 
04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
um piece of what we do is uh all the
 
04:03:54.290 --> 04:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
organizations that register with us are
 
04:03:58.250 --> 04:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
required to report to us annually and
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
what they report is also available to
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
the public and we review those reports
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
for a number of things if a charity
 
04:04:08.330 --> 04:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
appears to be having some kind of
 
04:04:10.610 --> 04:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
financial trouble we might inquire
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on with them
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
um another thing that we look for very
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
carefully is Charities are not supposed
 
04:04:19.610 --> 04:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be operating for the
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
benefit of that their charitable purpose
 
04:04:23.809 --> 04:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
and not for the benefit of the directors
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
and their board of directors so we have
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
a statute that um that deals with what
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
are called pecuniary benefits
 
04:04:32.330 --> 04:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
transactions other states refer to those
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
as as conflict of interest transactions
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
which is a term you may be more familiar
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
with essentially if if a charity engages
 
04:04:43.370 --> 04:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
in a contract or a payment to a member
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
of its board of directors there's a
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
series of of processes that have to be
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
followed to ensure that that actually is
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the charity and
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
very frequently it is so you may be
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
someone who you may sit on a board of
 
04:04:57.530 --> 04:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
directors and also independently own a
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
heating oil company and in order to
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
benefit the charity you want to sell
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
your heating oil to the charity at A Cut
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
Rate so it actually benefits them you
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
still make you're still receiving money
 
04:05:08.689 --> 04:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
off of it but you may not even making a
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
profit that's all above board but in
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
order to be sure that it is we require
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
that um that the that the board vote in
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
the absence of that person who's in that
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
contract to make sure that it is in the
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
best interest if it exceeds a certain
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
threshold it has to be disclosed to our
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
office before it happens and they're
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
also seeing publication in a newspaper
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
so that the public is aware that this is
 
04:05:30.239 --> 04:05:32.689 align:start position:0%
so that the public is aware that this is
happening

04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
um so those are our larger
 
04:05:36.779 --> 04:05:37.429 align:start position:0%
um so those are our larger
um

04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
duties we also have a handful of other
 
04:05:45.530 --> 04:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
activities such as uh when a uh
 
04:05:48.410 --> 04:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
someone's will includes a donation to a
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
charity the Probate Court notifies us
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
will be part of that uh of that
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding and once the if there's a
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
trust established we'll review
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
accountings of that trust sometimes over
 
04:06:03.889 --> 04:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
time the the trust will essentially run
 
04:06:05.150 --> 04:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
out of money it doesn't make sense to
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
maintain it any longer and will or or it
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
will appear that the investment of the
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
fund is not prudent and will want to
 
04:06:14.689 --> 04:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's being that it's that
 
04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
the investment process has changed so
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
that the the trust continues to make
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
money and continue to support the
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
purpose that it's set up for
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
um State and State our municipalities
 
04:06:28.010 --> 04:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
and counties also all have Trustees of
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
trust funds so um this is money that is
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
held in trust by the trustees of trust
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
funds that for some purpose that someone
 
04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
donated to the town oftentimes it's to
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
fund a park or to have a scholarship at
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
a school those are kind of common types
 
04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
of trusts that that Trustees of trust
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
funds and towns will hold and we
 
04:06:50.880 --> 04:06:51.650 align:start position:0%
funds and towns will hold and we
um

04:06:51.650 --> 04:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
we receive reports from the towns of the
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
balances of all of their funds their
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
investment policies things like that and
 
04:07:04.250 --> 04:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
we review those to ensure that the that
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're sustainable and also sometimes
 
04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are legal so
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes a trust was set up over a
 
04:07:15.290 --> 04:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago that is for a purpose
 
04:07:17.929 --> 04:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
that we that that our state supreme
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
court has recognized is no longer lawful
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
the most common example of that is a
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship for Protestant students that
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
would be something that would set up
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
um pretty commonly a while ago and now
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
um we know that that our that our
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
constitution does not allow us to
 
04:07:34.969 --> 04:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
distinguish between people of different
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
faiths so our office will get involved
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
to help the trustees in court to modify
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
that trust and ensure that it's not
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
um our uh our primary focus
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
um as providing this public information
 
04:07:55.729 --> 04:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
that I just laid out but also
 
04:07:58.250 --> 04:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that this is a that
 
04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
non-profit sector is an 11 billion
 
04:08:00.060 --> 04:08:01.010 align:start position:0%
non-profit sector is an 11 billion
dollar

04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:08:02.689 --> 04:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
um a year industry in New Hampshire and
 
04:08:05.330 --> 04:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
that 15 of New Hampshire's Workforce is
 
04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
employed by a non-profit we recognize
 
04:08:10.250 --> 04:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
that these are very important entities
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so rather than take enforcement our
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
first course of action is always
 
04:08:17.450 --> 04:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
education we don't want to shut down
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
these Charities that are doing important
 
04:08:24.050 --> 04:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
work so when we see an issue our first
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the first thing we try to do is to
 
04:08:28.969 --> 04:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
work with the Charities and most times
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
what has happened is that people with
 
04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
very good intentions just didn't quite
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
understand what they were legally
 
04:08:35.570 --> 04:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
required to do we set them on the right
 
04:08:37.610 --> 04:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
track and they keep going it's
 
04:08:39.889 --> 04:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
occasionally unfortunately the case that
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
that's that it's not that innocent that
 
04:08:43.969 --> 04:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
there's some there's theft that there's
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of funds and those
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
cases we will take the entities to court
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll have a receiver
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
appointed to take over administration of
 
04:08:54.410 --> 04:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
the charity until it can be set back on
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
its its proper footing we don't like to
 
04:08:59.150 --> 04:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
shut these Charities down if they are
 
04:09:00.889 --> 04:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
doing important work we like to get the
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bad actors out of the picture and then
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
put new board members new executive
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
director in place who can set the
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
charity on its way
 
04:09:09.840 --> 04:09:11.750 align:start position:0%
charity on its way
um

04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:13.610 --> 04:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
the only other things I would mention
 
04:09:13.620 --> 04:09:15.650 align:start position:0%
the only other things I would mention
are

04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
so we do have a jurisdiction over
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
conservation easements if they are
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
donated conservation easements those are
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts if someone donates a
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
conservation easement
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a process where if uh
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
someone wants to modify a conservation
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
easement then they have to involve our
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
office oftentimes if it's simply to add
 
04:09:41.330 --> 04:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
more land to a conservation easement or
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
release a restriction so that it's
 
04:09:45.889 --> 04:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
actually more protective of the land we
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
won't have any issue with that but if
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
someone wants to relocate the conserved
 
04:09:52.370 --> 04:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
land to a different location or carve
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
out this piece and add this piece we'll
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
be very um we'll be closely involved in
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes that will require us
 
04:09:59.929 --> 04:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
going to court to get Court approval of
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
that change and our offices I was always
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
a party to those proceedings
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
um so we do all that we have um the
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
director and myself are the two
 
04:10:12.170 --> 04:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the office
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
um we have a financial analyst we have
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
two investigative paralegals two
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
paralegals and administrative assistant
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and we also are self-funded so we we
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
charge fees for the um registrations and
 
04:10:26.809 --> 04:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
annual reporting we don't get General
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
funds for any of what we do
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
um but that's uh pretty much our our
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
office and I'm happy to take any
 
04:10:33.960 --> 04:10:36.590 align:start position:0%
office and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I forgot about how all these
 
04:10:41.450 --> 04:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
activities and now I remember what it
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
was it was pecuniary benefits that's
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
what that's what because it used to go
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
to Judiciary and then they and but but
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
column or his position was if you were
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the board you can't do anything for
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
an organization and and everybody was
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
not happy with the decision so they they
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
brought the bill to Commerce and we
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
created that pecuniary benefit statute
 
04:11:02.760 --> 04:11:04.729 align:start position:0%
created that pecuniary benefit statute
so

04:11:04.729 --> 04:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
how many nonprofits are there that's a
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
good question it was on my paper and I
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
didn't say it so uh so we have
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
um 13 000 Charities to register with our
 
04:11:16.370 --> 04:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
office about
 
04:11:18.650 --> 04:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
um of those about 6 000 are New
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based so uh and we obviously
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
we pay more attention to the Charities
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
that are based in New Hampshire
 
04:11:27.110 --> 04:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we we do review all of the annual
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
reports we do review all the
 
04:11:28.319 --> 04:11:29.630 align:start position:0%
reports we do review all the
registrations

04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
um even which paying a particular
 
04:11:32.689 --> 04:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
attention to the new hampshire-based
 
04:11:32.699 --> 04:11:34.809 align:start position:0%
attention to the new hampshire-based
ones

04:11:34.809 --> 04:11:34.819 align:start position:0%
ones
 
04:11:37.969 --> 04:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you um I
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
was curious if you feel that you have
 
04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
adequate resources to investigate
 
04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
Charities that may not be following
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
their own bylaws or violating State
 
04:11:49.849 --> 04:11:49.859 align:start position:0%
statutes uh there's always a possibility
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
for more resources um we we do have uh
 
04:11:57.050 --> 04:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
so we received those um those annual
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
reports and we do review each one they
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
typically all come in at once so
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
um because people follow the IRS
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
reporting year and so every everybody
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
who's filing uh
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
November and and uh March are our big
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
times so we'll get
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
10 000 reports at once and so we're
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
still kind of trying to drag through
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
that backlog of what had come in in
 
04:12:21.540 --> 04:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
that backlog of what had come in in
November

04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
November
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
um but yes I think any any additional
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
resources would certainly help us to to
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
pick through those we do have to make um
 
04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
make calls about which of these um
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
issues that we uncover are are so
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
important that we need to spend a lot of
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
time on them and which are are not so uh
 
04:12:41.570 --> 04:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
I would never say no to more resources
 
04:12:41.580 --> 04:12:42.889 align:start position:0%
I would never say no to more resources
certainly

04:12:42.889 --> 04:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Representative Vincent thank
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks a lot for taking
 
04:12:49.969 --> 04:12:49.979 align:start position:0%
my question so is charitable trust the
 
04:12:52.729 --> 04:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
same thing as non-profit or different it
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
is it is different so uh non-profit is
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
mostly an IRS distinction you've heard
 
04:13:00.650 --> 04:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
of 501c Threes there are I think 13 or
 
04:13:03.070 --> 04:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
14 different classifications
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
C3 so and we are limited to to c3s which
 
04:13:08.570 --> 04:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
is the organizations that are organized
 
04:13:10.849 --> 04:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
for charitable purposes
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
um there are other non-profit
 
04:13:15.769 --> 04:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
organizations so 501c4s are ones that
 
04:13:16.610 --> 04:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
you'll probably have a lot of
 
04:13:18.290 --> 04:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
interaction with as legislators they're
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
not chamber of commerces are six or
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
something like that but for all tons and
 
04:13:24.170 --> 04:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
purposes when someone says we're a
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
non-profit right they're a charitable so
 
04:13:29.150 --> 04:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
they always say are you a 501c3 same
 
04:13:29.160 --> 04:13:29.870 align:start position:0%
they always say are you a 501c3 same
thing

04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
so your office doesn't cover that we we
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
would cover them if they were soliciting
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
charitable nations from the public but
 
04:13:38.570 --> 04:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
not as a matter of course only the 501c
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
threes thank you very much
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so just make sure you when you
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
realize you gave a donation to someone
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
who's not a C3 like to a chamber of
 
04:13:49.490 --> 04:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
commerce that's not tax deductible it's
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you very
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
much good job it'd be wonderful if you
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
could email that to everybody that would
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
sure it's actually our biennial report
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
to you from Leslie that's even better
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank you so much
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right uh so
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
we'll move right on right into
 
04:14:10.610 --> 04:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
Securities I see
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
and did I oh she left I saw her
 
04:14:20.640 --> 04:14:22.130 align:start position:0%
and did I oh she left I saw her
assistant

04:14:22.130 --> 04:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
secretary of state was popped in a
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.130 --> 04:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
so kind of interesting the
 
04:14:36.530 --> 04:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
um consumer protection division was just
 
04:14:38.570 --> 04:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
created in the 70s
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
75 I remember like that's my year I
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:14:46.490 --> 04:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting they're talking
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
about how they have these other two
 
04:14:50.809 --> 04:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
divisions insurance and and uh could
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
sort of uh the uh charitable trust or
 
04:14:56.689 --> 04:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
being such old entities so now we're
 
04:14:58.929 --> 04:14:58.939 align:start position:0%
talking about a relatively young
 
04:15:01.729 --> 04:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
entities because securities
 
04:15:03.410 --> 04:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
was created I think just when I got
 
04:15:06.349 --> 04:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
elected and uh just when I first came in
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
right at 80. yes that's correct uh Mr
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
chairman also uh creating exclusive
 
04:15:15.290 --> 04:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction within those uh agencies
 
04:15:17.150 --> 04:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know to enforce their respective
 
04:15:19.490 --> 04:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
laws be it Insurance Securities Public
 
04:15:21.410 --> 04:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and yeah it ended
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
up being added to the to the consumer
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
protection act as an exemption but yeah
 
04:15:27.130 --> 04:15:27.140 align:start position:0%
no I I remember
 
04:15:30.290 --> 04:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh well uh when it was first created and
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
then then uh legally legislatively uh by
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
bifurcated and then given to the
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general excuse me the Secretary
 
04:15:41.809 --> 04:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
of State's office where before
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
Securities was actually its own division
 
04:15:45.889 --> 04:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
in for a short period of time
 
04:15:48.530 --> 04:15:48.540 align:start position:0%

04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
begin as you look at that fact sheet
 
04:17:26.450 --> 04:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
that you'll notice that the numbers
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
before you may seem relatively large in
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of registered
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
representatives and firms and there
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
really is a good reason for that and
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is because New Hampshire really is
 
04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Investments New
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really is a wealth Center when
 
04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
it when it comes to our our citizenry uh
 
04:17:49.490 --> 04:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
we have a considerable amount of Assets
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the state we have a much older
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
population in fact we're the second
 
04:17:55.849 --> 04:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
oldest population in terms of median age
 
04:17:58.250 --> 04:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
right behind Maine we're older than
 
04:18:01.090 --> 04:18:01.100 align:start position:0%
Florida it's hard to believe uh but
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
still we are a center where there are a
 
04:18:07.729 --> 04:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
number of retirees and retirees have a
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
lifetime of assets and that's where
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
those who are likely to commit
 
04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud against someone go they
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
go where the money is and so New
 
04:18:19.849 --> 04:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can be really and is in many
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
instances a target for investment fraud
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
so with regard to the the first
 
04:18:29.210 --> 04:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
component licensing and registration as
 
04:18:30.769 --> 04:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
I mentioned we really do have a number
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
of uh licensees
 
04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
um there are two really two components
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
and not I really don't want to bore you
 
04:18:38.809 --> 04:18:38.819 align:start position:0%
to death with things so if I see anyone
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
not off I'll I'll just move on but there
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
the two components are broker-dealers
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
and investment advisors now
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
broker-dealers as as I might kind of
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
characterize it those are individuals
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I know we have a former registry
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
representative in in the room as well
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
but a broker dealer representative will
 
04:19:01.130 --> 04:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
be one who will buy or sell Securities
 
04:19:03.769 --> 04:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to a client to buy
 
04:19:07.370 --> 04:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
or sell a security uh for a fee you know
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
usually there's a commission associated
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
with that uh and they're essentially
 
04:19:14.330 --> 04:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
their duty is to make sure that whatever
 
04:19:16.670 --> 04:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
it is that they are presenting to the
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
client that they make sure that it it
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
meets the clients risk tolerance and
 
04:19:24.410 --> 04:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
investment objective that's really the
 
04:19:26.210 --> 04:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
two two primary things that they have to
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
be mindful of when they make that
 
04:19:30.290 --> 04:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation so as a as Regulators
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking for that whenever there
 
04:19:34.969 --> 04:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
are any disputed type transactions the
 
04:19:36.889 --> 04:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
second type of category are investment
 
04:19:39.769 --> 04:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
advisors and just as the name would
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
suggest investment advisors offer
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
investment advice to clients on a
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
variety of topics not necessarily just
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
limited to equities but they may be
 
04:19:50.450 --> 04:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
looking at things such as real estate
 
04:19:54.170 --> 04:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
their tax situation there may be you
 
04:19:55.849 --> 04:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
know forward-thinking financial planning
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
College Planning things of that nature
 
04:20:01.490 --> 04:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
they tend to look at at a broader
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
picture however the way in which they
 
04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
may be compensated there's a number of
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
different ways but primarily it's based
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
upon a percentage of the overall assets
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
that they are overseeing on behalf of
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
the client so that's those are really
 
04:20:16.969 --> 04:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
the two means by which Securities are
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
bought or sold or investment advice uh
 
04:20:20.689 --> 04:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
is registered
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
the one distinction though with an
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
investment advisor is that they are a
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
fiduciary they are fiduciaries meaning
 
04:20:29.090 --> 04:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
that whatever it is that they do they
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
must act in the best interest of the
 
04:20:32.689 --> 04:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
client above and beyond their own
 
04:20:34.490 --> 04:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
interests however they may be
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
compensated uh it must be in the best
 
04:20:40.610 --> 04:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
interest of the client uh which you know
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
is is is really a good thing on the uh
 
04:20:47.570 --> 04:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
broke a dealer side we register as you
 
04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
can see well over 148 000 registered
 
04:20:56.150 --> 04:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
reps and uh 1324 firms uh at that's as
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
of 12 31 of this year on The Advisory
 
04:21:03.130 --> 04:21:03.140 align:start position:0%
side a smaller population of
 
04:21:07.870 --> 04:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
5216 investment advisor reps and 28 174
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
advisory firms and then we also register
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
Securities products which would be
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
things such as mutual funds every mutual
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
fund that is sold in the state of New
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is registered with the state
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
alt and then we have other types of
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
offerings that are sold in the state
 
04:21:26.809 --> 04:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
private certain type of private
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
offerings and then other Securities uh
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
real estate investment trusts things
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
like that they're well over 29 000 of
 
04:21:36.530 --> 04:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
those registered with our office so when
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
you add up all of those products and all
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
of the licensing the bureau will
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
generate somewhere of actually as of the
 
04:21:49.370 --> 04:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
end of 1231 uh 41 no 44.1 million
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in fees all of which go to the
 
04:21:55.250 --> 04:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
general fund because we are a
 
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency through fines and
 
04:22:00.769 --> 04:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
penalties only so it really is a sizable
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
amount to to process
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
the other component is our audit uh an
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
examination role and that is that we
 
04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
will conduct unannounced audits or
 
04:22:15.050 --> 04:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
reviews at each of those offices on an
 
04:22:17.450 --> 04:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
unannounced basis uh to to make sure
 
04:22:20.330 --> 04:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
that they're complying with state law I
 
04:22:23.570 --> 04:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
am happy to report that the firms in New
 
04:22:25.090 --> 04:22:25.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do a great job
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
and we may point out certain things that
 
04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
they could do better some there are
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
violations which we have to take action
 
04:22:35.210 --> 04:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh against the firm uh however for the
 
04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
most part they do a terrific job and I
 
04:22:40.010 --> 04:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
think that's as a result of having a
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
good solid program of of review with
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
them and showing them how they can
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
actually you know maybe perhaps you know
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
tighten or do better uh with with
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of their business
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
the number of Branch offices is
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
expanding uh in fact a lot of the firms
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
during covid decided to send most of
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
their employees home and on the
 
04:23:05.330 --> 04:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
broker-dealer side a number of of
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
representatives are actually working
 
04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
from home now and so the question is are
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
those branch offices and should we be
 
04:23:14.210 --> 04:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
visiting those homes we do on the
 
04:23:15.769 --> 04:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
investment advisor side because many
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
work from home but that could very well
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
expand our our audit uh function but
 
04:23:23.450 --> 04:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily asking and I
 
04:23:25.250 --> 04:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
expect representative Burroughs may ask
 
04:23:27.050 --> 04:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
me the question looking for additional
 
04:23:29.210 --> 04:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
resources we're going to try to work
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
within the constraints you know that we
 
04:23:34.130 --> 04:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
have in in terms of Staffing to address
 
04:23:34.140 --> 04:23:35.389 align:start position:0%
have in in terms of Staffing to address
that

04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
one of the more exciting parts of what
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
we do as investor education and it
 
04:23:42.889 --> 04:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
really is of an important part of our
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
mission our Focus really is on fraud
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
prevention Ed Financial education is is
 
04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
pretty broad but when you focus on
 
04:23:54.769 --> 04:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
investing uh our message is to say to
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
invest uh in in a safe and prudent
 
04:23:57.359 --> 04:23:58.550 align:start position:0%
invest uh in in a safe and prudent
manner

04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
manner
 
04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
our our victims are just as just as you
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
might uh uh think and it's really what
 
04:24:07.490 --> 04:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
what it's it's the same story on the
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
licensing side uh our victims are those
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
who are older that they have a lifetime
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
of assets retirees and fraudsters will
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
come into the state of New Hampshire
 
04:24:19.670 --> 04:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
because they know that that's where the
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
money is and so New Hampshire because we
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
are a wealth Center we could also be a a
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
target for investment fraud uh and uh in
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
order to combat that it's really comes
 
04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
down to investor education so what do we
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
do we do a considerable amount of
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
Outreach to seniors uh particularly
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
organizations including lifelong
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
Learning Centers uh we uh such as Let's
 
04:24:51.050 --> 04:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
osher uh uh which is organized through
 
04:24:53.450 --> 04:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College uh the Oli program
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
which is administered through Granite
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
State College as well as independent
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
living organizations they're all prime
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
targets and so that's where we really
 
04:25:04.010 --> 04:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
need to and have been consistently
 
04:25:06.650 --> 04:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
educating the public we also reach out
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
to a number of Civic organizations such
 
04:25:13.870 --> 04:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
as a rotary or fraternal organizations
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
as well as interestingly other other
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
organizations more recently I did a
 
04:25:21.769 --> 04:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
presentation to the Joint New Hampshire
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Society of Engineers which has nothing
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
to do with Securities but they do have
 
04:25:29.809 --> 04:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
assets and they can be a Target uh so we
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
try to reach that segment of the of the
 
04:25:34.010 --> 04:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
population as well
 
04:25:36.650 --> 04:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
under the direction of Secretary of
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%

04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
introduced a really interesting investor
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%

I shouldn't call it veto day but that's
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
all I know it is to be and it was in
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
your mailbox but for some of the newer
 
04:27:27.130 --> 04:27:27.140 align:start position:0%
representatives to this committee
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll find that this is a a
 
04:27:33.889 --> 04:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
really nice source of information on how
 
04:27:36.530 --> 04:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
to invest wisely first off it's
 
04:27:38.210 --> 04:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
available to the general public at no
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
cost in fact if you would like
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
additional copies my contact information
 
04:27:45.050 --> 04:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
is on that sheet you can just ask me
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
what whatever it is that you need in
 
04:27:48.610 --> 04:27:48.620 align:start position:0%
terms of quantity
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
the guide covers a number of really
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
interesting topics such as the selection
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
of an advisor but what's what are
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
investments and why should you why
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
should you invest
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
um some of the typical scams or frauds
 
04:28:08.570 --> 04:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
that may be conducted or you have to be
 
04:28:12.130 --> 04:28:12.140 align:start position:0%
mindful of and uh and a host of other
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
topics which I think is useful this is
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
available both in English and Spanish as
 
04:28:21.410 --> 04:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
well so if you have a population of
 
04:28:23.170 --> 04:28:23.180 align:start position:0%
Spanish speaking
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
individuals let us know and we'll we'll
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
get those to you as well so that that
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
comprises the the new invest smart and H
 
04:28:34.729 --> 04:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
type program but I would also encourage
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
you if if you uh happen to know of or if
 
04:28:40.729 --> 04:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
you are part of a group in your District
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
that would like to to have the bureau
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
come and speak to an organization to
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
talk about safe investing or more than
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
happy to do that we'll provide each
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
participant obviously with a copy of of
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
our investor guide and try to tailor our
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
presentation to your group it doesn't
 
04:28:59.570 --> 04:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
matter what it is nor whether it's
 
04:29:02.210 --> 04:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
daytime or evening please just reach out
 
04:29:04.929 --> 04:29:04.939 align:start position:0%
to us and we're certainly available
 
04:29:08.090 --> 04:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
to present at this point I'd like to
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Eric who will talk about
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
our enforcement component as well as
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Barry
 
04:29:19.250 --> 04:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'll keep this microphone a little
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
further away from me because I talk loud
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
enough as it is so
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
so again my name is Eric Force here I've
 
04:29:26.030 --> 04:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
been with the Securities Bureau for 13
 
04:29:28.250 --> 04:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
years now and
 
04:29:31.610 --> 04:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
primarily working in enforcement
 
04:29:33.710 --> 04:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
the best part of our job is being able
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
to help New Hampshire consumers big or
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
small we have people come in who have
 
04:29:39.769 --> 04:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
lost money that is a small sliver of
 
04:29:41.210 --> 04:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
their portfolio but they're troubled by
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
what happened or it's their entire life
 
04:29:42.840 --> 04:29:43.790 align:start position:0%
what happened or it's their entire life
savings

04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
be it 10 grand or over a million dollars
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
we treat everybody the same we we take
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
complaints from consumers and the best
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
part of our job is helping those
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
consumers out primarily recovering if we
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
can losses that may have been incurred
 
04:29:58.610 --> 04:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
as a result of violating our law but
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
bringing Bad actors to Justice I'll let
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
go what Barry said the firms in New
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do a great job the people in
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire investing on behalf of New
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents do a great job
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
but not all of them and the ones that
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't end up
 
04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
in our enforcement unit so I've been
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
there 13 years
 
04:30:17.450 --> 04:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
we we operate
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
on complaints primarily so we receive
 
04:30:21.170 --> 04:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
complaints from New Hampshire consumers
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
or people outside of New Hampshire doing
 
04:30:25.250 --> 04:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
business with New Hampshire consumers
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
we primarily receive them from consumers
 
04:30:27.239 --> 04:30:28.429 align:start position:0%
we primarily receive them from consumers
themselves

04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we receive referrals from
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
other state agencies or federal agencies
 
04:30:35.450 --> 04:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
but most often a case started with our
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
office starts with somebody walking in
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
or calling and talking about a problem
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
they have with a broker or an investment
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
advisor or just somebody selling them
 
04:30:46.849 --> 04:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
Securities because you don't necessarily
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed to be selling
 
04:30:50.990 --> 04:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
securities to New Hampshire residents so
 
04:30:52.490 --> 04:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
they come in all forms
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
on average and this is just an average
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
we have about 70 investigations a year
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
mostly emanating from complaints but
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're tips sometimes we see
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
issues in the marketplace and we can
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
bring enforcement matters related to
 
04:31:08.030 --> 04:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
that but there's about 70 or so in the
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
those we also have about 40 enforcement
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
actions that we end up filing every year
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm a very big some are very small
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
some of them are very defunct companies
 
04:31:23.389 --> 04:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
that have no assets left and it's come
 
04:31:24.769 --> 04:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
to our attention because it's been a
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
total fraud that's been well reported
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere some of them we help
 
04:31:31.790 --> 04:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
uncover and we help reveal
 
04:31:33.769 --> 04:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
but we have about 40
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
cases a year
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
usually they're administrative
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
conditioner that provides a wide range
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
of tools to the enforcement unit to
 
04:31:45.050 --> 04:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
bring relief and expose exposed frauds
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
even Ponzi schemes in New Hampshire
 
04:31:50.769 --> 04:31:50.779 align:start position:0%
we've uncovered some of those but we
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
usually bring administrative cases but
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
we also have the legislature has granted
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
us wide authority to go to Superior
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
Court and bring relief in Superior Court
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
so we will bring primarily
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
administrative cases but we do go to
 
04:32:06.649 --> 04:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to freeze assets or to
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and force compliance with our orders
 
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
or our subpoenas so we're in court as
 
04:32:12.120 --> 04:32:13.729 align:start position:0%
or our subpoenas so we're in court as
well

04:32:13.729 --> 04:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of our cases are sales practice
 
04:32:17.929 --> 04:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
violations a broker
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
broke our law in engaging in a
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
transaction that would say unsuitable or
 
04:32:24.530 --> 04:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
unfair to the consumer
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
call them minor but those resultant
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
losses that really harm people so we
 
04:32:29.809 --> 04:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
have those types of sale practice
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
violation cases but it really runs to
 
04:32:33.170 --> 04:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
Gambit we have
 
04:32:36.050 --> 04:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
um total complete fraud cases as well as
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
the other side of that that Spectrum
 
04:32:40.729 --> 04:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
whether they're using online advertising
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
or print people are responding to ads
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
from fraudsters online or in print and
 
04:32:47.929 --> 04:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
losing significant amounts of money and
 
04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
some of our a lot of our cases are in
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
that world as well but it really runs
 
04:32:55.130 --> 04:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
the Gambit the um cases types of cases
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
we see often time and time again is
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
promissory note cases a note is a
 
04:33:01.250 --> 04:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
security there are some exemptions and
 
04:33:03.170 --> 04:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
there are some carbons that apply but
 
04:33:04.849 --> 04:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
generally a node is a security so when
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
people borrow money from somebody
 
04:33:08.330 --> 04:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
particularly when they're borrowing that
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
money to engage in an Enterprise to turn
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
a profit for that lender it's a security
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have those types of cases we have
 
04:33:18.051 --> 04:33:18.061 align:start position:0%
cases where people will
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
open up an LLC and sell interest in
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
their LLC to their friends Neighbors
 
04:33:24.170 --> 04:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
random people online
 
04:33:25.970 --> 04:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
those are securities so we have the
 
04:33:27.289 --> 04:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
types of cases that are not your typical
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
investment advisor and broker dealer
 
04:33:31.849 --> 04:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
cases we have plenty of those but we
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
also have half our world is also those
 
04:33:35.631 --> 04:33:35.641 align:start position:0%
other types of Securities transactions
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
that I just told you about I'm happy to
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
talk about further
 
04:33:41.929 --> 04:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
we routinely work with criminal
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
authorities you heard Brandon garad from
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau we have a
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
great relationship with the Attorney
 
04:33:47.689 --> 04:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
General's office and we work closely
 
04:33:49.849 --> 04:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
with them and and making sure that
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
people who violate our Securities laws
 
04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
because there are criminal components to
 
04:33:55.449 --> 04:33:55.459 align:start position:0%
it get brought to justice so we'll we'll
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
regularly meet with them at the AG's
 
04:34:01.570 --> 04:34:01.580 align:start position:0%
office Brandon's unit will engage in
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
referrals that anything we think might
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
be a crime we bring it over to them
 
04:34:06.650 --> 04:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not a Securities
 
04:34:08.929 --> 04:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
violation a Securities fraud and they'll
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
charge it as theft but oftentimes when
 
04:34:12.289 --> 04:34:12.299 align:start position:0%
you violate the Securities act and you
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
committed Securities fraud
 
04:34:16.609 --> 04:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
you've also committed theft so we are
 
04:34:18.410 --> 04:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
proud in our track record in working
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
other other uh criminal prosecutors
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've worked on some federal cases with
 
04:34:26.570 --> 04:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
the U.S attorney's office and the FBI
 
04:34:29.449 --> 04:34:29.459 align:start position:0%
and um we actually have some great cases
 
04:34:31.609 --> 04:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
with the County attorneys as well so we
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
have uh regular working relationships
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
with all the criminal authorities and
 
04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:37.141 align:start position:0%
are you know in the past
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
10 years or so we've brought I think a
 
04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
record number of Securities cases that
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
have gone criminal we've really brought
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
people to Justice in that realm and it's
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
I think sent sent an appropriate message
 
04:34:50.209 --> 04:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
and I've personally worked on a lot of
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
those cases and testified in grand
 
04:34:54.170 --> 04:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
juries and and we've been very
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
successful knock on wood in Superior
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
Court and on criminal cases because it's
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
hard to explain to a jury and jury
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
instructions uh Securities so that's one
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
hurdle that we're
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
we've done we've done well on
 
04:35:06.061 --> 04:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
we've done we've done well on
um

04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:09.529 --> 04:35:09.539 align:start position:0%
we also routinely work with the
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
Securities and Exchange Commission as
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
you can imagine a lot of the cases we
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
look at and the transactions we're
 
04:35:16.730 --> 04:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
looking at cross state lines and so we
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
regularly work with and bring cases
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say joint because they're a
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
separate agency but we concurrent cases
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
in uh parallel cases all the time and so
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
we have a great working relationship
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
with Boston regional office of the SEC
 
04:35:32.330 --> 04:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
and we routinely work on cases with them
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
referrals back and forth
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
we have a great working relationship
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
with the banking and insurance
 
04:35:39.410 --> 04:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
departments here in the state we meet
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
with them regularly I pick up the phone
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and talk to them weekly there's a lot of
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
cases that have both banking insurance
 
04:35:47.390 --> 04:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
or Insurance Banking and securities
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
components so by Statute we regularly
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
meet but more often than required by
 
04:35:54.170 --> 04:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
Statute we're talking and we're
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
regularly engaging each other because
 
04:35:57.170 --> 04:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh particularly with
 
04:36:00.289 --> 04:36:00.299 align:start position:0%
insurance over overlap
 
04:36:00.299 --> 04:36:01.429 align:start position:0%
insurance over overlap
um

04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
we routinely work with our neighboring
 
04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:07.141 align:start position:0%
states of Massachusetts Vermont uh Maine
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
and other states in New England on cases
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
because again a lot of these
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
Brokers investment advisors products are
 
04:36:17.570 --> 04:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
being sold across state lines and we we
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
work together to bring uh
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
to to bring those to a conclusion as
 
04:36:25.010 --> 04:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
well we regularly bring in about one to
 
04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in fines and
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
penalties as Barry alluded we're a
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency the registration fees
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
licensing fees
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
and the fees that Barry spoke about uh
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
are directly to the general fund we
 
04:36:39.529 --> 04:36:39.539 align:start position:0%
operate uh self-funded on the fines and
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
penalties that we uh administer against
 
04:36:44.631 --> 04:36:44.641 align:start position:0%
these agencies every every year uh
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
against these firms and brokers
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
not all of them pay it and we also are
 
04:36:52.010 --> 04:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
collection agency of sorts we definitely
 
04:36:54.769 --> 04:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
have judgments against people for
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
victims in New Hampshire that we are
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
every year we seem to add more to the
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
debt list of of consumers and victims in
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that owed money we
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue that but we still are
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
able to stay self-funded with the
 
04:37:10.429 --> 04:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
penalties that we're able to uh get from
 
04:37:12.529 --> 04:37:12.539 align:start position:0%
firms that can pay
 
04:37:12.539 --> 04:37:14.810 align:start position:0%
firms that can pay
um

04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
we regularly provide assistance that
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't really rise to enforcement but we
 
04:37:20.330 --> 04:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
get calls from consumers all the time uh
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
they can't get access to their accounts
 
04:37:23.689 --> 04:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
we quickly help them with that their
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
broker's not calling them back we
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
quickly help them with that I found the
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
stock certificate I'm an administrator
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
of an estate and I found this in the
 
04:37:31.490 --> 04:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
bottom drawer is this worth anything
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
those are always fun we Chase those down
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
but we do provide that uh that help to
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
Consumers uh on a regular basis as well
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
we're heavily involved in the North
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
American Securities administrators
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
Association that's the conglomerate of
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
State Securities Regulators in North
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
America uh we continue to hold
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
leadership roles there and help other
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
states and work with other states
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
through that National Organization and
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
they've they've done a great job for New
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they they help us bring Global
 
04:38:01.250 --> 04:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
cases that we couldn't do by ourselves
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
and The Leverage of other states coming
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
together with NASA and not the NASA
 
04:38:07.010 --> 04:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of with this NASA is is
 
04:38:09.289 --> 04:38:09.299 align:start position:0%
a great a great benefit to the state we
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
we all we also regulate pooled Risk
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
Management Programs as Barry alluded to
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's RSA 5B those are when political
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
subdivisions come together and pool
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
money for the purchase of health
 
04:38:23.929 --> 04:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
insurance property Casualty Insurance
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
and different insurances it's a statute
 
04:38:27.769 --> 04:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
that allows these communities to come
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
together to pool their money because
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's always a better deal to be had
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
when you pull your money together and
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
you're a larger group especially with
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
the tax benefits provided by RSA 5B so
 
04:38:40.010 --> 04:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
they are significant there's five pools
 
04:38:42.289 --> 04:38:42.299 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they annually file with
 
04:38:43.970 --> 04:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
us and we continue to monitor monitor
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
and ensure their compliance with RSA 5B
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that's a big role in our office and
 
04:38:50.449 --> 04:38:50.459 align:start position:0%
continues to be a big role and sort of
 
04:38:52.369 --> 04:38:52.379 align:start position:0%
the other facet of our office they
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
provide a great benefit to the New
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire political subdivisions and it
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of resources to monitor
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
their compliance and and making sure
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
that Surplus is returned as they're
 
04:39:04.250 --> 04:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
supposed to under the law we can talk
 
04:39:05.449 --> 04:39:05.459 align:start position:0%
about this further but we've had a
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
cases had gone to the Supreme Court uh
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
um enforcing compliance with RSA 5B that
 
04:39:13.490 --> 04:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
we've been successful in returning tens
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars to communities uh
 
04:39:17.449 --> 04:39:17.459 align:start position:0%
in in the form of surplus that should
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
have been returned a long time ago
 
04:39:20.209 --> 04:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
that's another big part of our office
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
where the enforcement team is
 
04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:24.061 align:start position:0%
approximately give or take six attorneys
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
but they have varying functions in the
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
office with examinations and Audits and
 
04:39:30.410 --> 04:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
so they don't all spend full time on
 
04:39:32.330 --> 04:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement but give or take we have six
 
04:39:35.631 --> 04:39:35.641 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh working every day and
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
helping New Hampshire investors which is
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
something I'm personally really proud
 
04:39:42.170 --> 04:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
about having done for the past 13 years
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh anytime there's any
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
legislation before this committee or
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
before the legislature you'll hear me
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
and Barry pounding that consumer
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
protection drum uh we are a consumer
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
protection agency and we will carefully
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
review legislation
 
04:39:58.610 --> 04:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
we recognize benefits of new products
 
04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
and new ideas but we have to always
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
pound that drum because it's important
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
products are changing every day I'm sure
 
04:40:07.850 --> 04:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to see legislation and we
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
have seen legislation and we'll continue
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
to try to protect our investigative
 
04:40:13.970 --> 04:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
Authority we should be able to continue
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
to investigate and securities is such a
 
04:40:18.890 --> 04:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
broad sweeping term
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
um it's meant to Encompass all types of
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
activities that are changing every day
 
04:40:23.390 --> 04:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to continue to safeguard
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
that Authority and that's where you'll
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
see us uh this year and years to come
 
04:40:29.810 --> 04:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
before this legislature
 
04:40:29.820 --> 04:40:32.930 align:start position:0%
before this legislature
um

04:40:32.930 --> 04:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:34.490 --> 04:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's all I've got on my I'm happy to
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
I talk fast so slow me down and ask me
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you
 
04:40:48.890 --> 04:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
um through the fines that you collect
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
does that ever go towards making
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
investors whole who have been defrauded
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
is that where it goes
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
so the fines and penalties are what pays
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
our expenses of our office any
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
difference gets poured over to the
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
general fund which happens I think every
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
single year that I've been there we've
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
had it but no the fines and penalties do
 
04:41:07.970 --> 04:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
not go
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
but we do get orders for restitution and
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
we do we've returned I think over 70
 
04:41:16.610 --> 04:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the past 15 years to
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
um actually representative I I would
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
venture to say it's probably over 125
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
million now at this point in terms of
 
04:41:25.490 --> 04:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
restitution so where's the source of
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
that money if it's not from fines to for
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
repayment is that money that you've
 
04:41:31.970 --> 04:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
taken back we have collect we would have
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
collected from uh firms
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
um uh for repayment to aggrieved
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
investors is the last question is it
 
04:41:42.650 --> 04:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
ever possible for a group of aggrieved
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
investors to seek legislative response
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
for repayment as was done with the Ponzi
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
scheme uh there was as I recall in the
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
in the case of Financial Resources
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
mortgage uh there was uh in fact I think
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
legislation had passed for funding for
 
04:41:58.500 --> 04:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
legislation had passed for funding for
that

04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:01.610 --> 04:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
um however we you know it's been our
 
04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
contention I could see representative
 
04:42:03.060 --> 04:42:04.128 align:start position:0%
contention I could see representative
upon

04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
upon
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
um that the issue there involved
 
04:42:06.718 --> 04:42:08.330 align:start position:0%
um that the issue there involved
mortgages

04:42:08.330 --> 04:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
mortgages
 
04:42:12.850 --> 04:42:12.860 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh that it was intended to
 
04:42:16.490 --> 04:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
provide restitution to those who had uh
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
invested actually in mortgages as
 
04:42:20.510 --> 04:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to Securities thanks
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
and if I could add to that a lot of our
 
04:42:24.410 --> 04:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
cases in the enforcement unit if they do
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
resolve without a hearing they will
 
04:42:27.890 --> 04:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
resolve with restitution back to
 
04:42:30.410 --> 04:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
Consumers and there's plenty of cases I
 
04:42:31.850 --> 04:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
have that the fines and penalties have
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
gone unpaid and any money we do get we
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
put towards the restitution first it's
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
important to pay back New Hampshire
 
04:42:38.930 --> 04:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
investors as much as we can and we're
 
04:42:40.610 --> 04:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that when we settle cases
 
04:42:42.650 --> 04:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
and we make sure that these you know
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
these big broker dealers and these big
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
Investment Advisors
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
are paying restitution are paying its
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
restitution discouragement or rescission
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's one of our primary forms of relief
 
04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
people still have their private right of
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
action and we remind them of that but we
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to get money back
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
to uh consumers in New Hampshire that
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
have lost money as a result of violating
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
our law
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah restitution was always in their
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
statute I didn't we didn't have to add
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
that where we did for insurance and
 
04:43:14.090 --> 04:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
banking it was always there and that
 
04:43:16.610 --> 04:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
decision the frm decision was that was
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
really a banking problem rather than a
 
04:43:21.650 --> 04:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
Securities problem
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%

04:44:54.530 --> 04:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.540 --> 04:45:12.788 align:start position:0%

04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:59.410 --> 04:45:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%

04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%

afternoon members of the committee Mr

chairman I'm Joseph Malik I'm the
 
04:46:37.550 --> 04:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
chairman of the New Hampshire Liquor
 
04:46:41.090 --> 04:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
Commission with me today is our CFO Tina
 
04:46:46.250 --> 04:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
demirs our CEO James Vera Lori Piper our
 
04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
chief marketing officer and Mark
 
04:46:49.550 --> 04:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
armaganian who is the chief of
 
04:46:49.560 --> 04:46:51.050 align:start position:0%
armaganian who is the chief of
enforcement

04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:46:53.570 --> 04:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
so what we've prepared today is just a
 
04:46:55.730 --> 04:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
some light reading and an overview of
 
04:46:58.128 --> 04:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
what the Liquor Commission does
 
04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
so on page two you'll see that we are
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
one of 17 control states in the country
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
after prohibition the federal government
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
allowed states to decide whether they
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
want to be open or closed States and New
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was one of the very wise
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
states to take the the liquor control to
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
themselves and we're the only state that
 
04:47:21.610 --> 04:47:21.620 align:start position:0%
does the
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
wholesale and the retail of liquor we do
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
have brokers in the state as you'll
 
04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
notice on page three the three-tier
 
04:47:29.820 --> 04:47:31.128 align:start position:0%
notice on page three the three-tier
system

04:47:31.128 --> 04:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
but we're the only state that has
 
04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
exclusive Liquor and Wine in the states
 
04:47:39.050 --> 04:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
there is other states that do some of
 
04:47:40.970 --> 04:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
their retail but we are the One You're
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
the only state that does it exclusively
 
04:47:43.680 --> 04:47:44.830 align:start position:0%
the only state that does it exclusively
so

04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:47.690 --> 04:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
on page four you'll see the value of the
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
three-tier system
 
04:47:52.010 --> 04:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh and basically the value of the
 
04:47:54.650 --> 04:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
three-tier system for us is that those
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the retail outlets that the consumers go
 
04:47:59.890 --> 04:47:59.900 align:start position:0%
into are also control venues for alcohol
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
so we have the profits from those areas
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
but we also have control of the product
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
from when it enters the state into our
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
warehouse in Bow our 241
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
000 square foot Warehouse that we're now
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
adding on to and we have a 20-year
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
contract with DHL to run that warehouse
 
04:48:20.570 --> 04:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
on page five you'll notice the
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
competition the major competition for us
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
obviously comes from Massachusetts uh 50
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales are cross-border
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
sales 23 of those sales come from
 
04:48:36.410 --> 04:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts our biggest competitor in
 
04:48:38.810 --> 04:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and around the country as
 
04:48:41.448 --> 04:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
you'll see on page five is Total Wine
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
you can see how governor Patrick passed
 
04:48:46.910 --> 04:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
the law in 2011. they they took the tax
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
off of alcohol they changed the amount
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
of licenses that they can hold and
 
04:48:54.830 --> 04:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're raising the tap the cap again uh
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we don't know exactly where it
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
will be but we feel that I'm sorry in
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
2024 it but we feel that it will
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
probably be uh 11 stores Total Wine
 
04:49:07.128 --> 04:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
being the biggest competitor and on page
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
six you'll see the mammoth business that
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
Total Wine is they're 5 billion in
 
04:49:16.430 --> 04:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue in 2020. they have 245 stores in
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
27 States 10 stores in New England they
 
04:49:22.010 --> 04:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
have many many employees across the
 
04:49:24.590 --> 04:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
country and they're adding two two more
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
stores in Massachusetts to their current
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
six they'll be adding two more this year
 
04:49:34.850 --> 04:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
so basically inside of the 45 495 belt
 
04:49:37.550 --> 04:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
they have they have all of their stores
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
one store is in Southborough that
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
exceeds the 495 belt but they've
 
04:49:44.690 --> 04:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
concentrated everything from that point
 
04:49:47.448 --> 04:49:47.458 align:start position:0%
east so where the population is and
 
04:49:51.250 --> 04:49:51.260 align:start position:0%
obviously where our consumers come from
 
04:49:54.770 --> 04:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
they've concentrated on that they're a
 
04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
behemoth in the business they do a lot
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
of a lot of marketing they don't beat us
 
04:50:01.850 --> 04:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
in price
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
all the time but they do beat us in
 
04:50:08.030 --> 04:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
price sometimes we are we don't do any
 
04:50:10.250 --> 04:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
private labeling which that's what they
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
do they do a bait and switch Market we
 
04:50:15.890 --> 04:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
deal in name brand products and name
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
brand prices we don't have any off
 
04:50:19.850 --> 04:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
Brands and we don't have any private
 
04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
Brands and Total Wine is a private brand
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
retailer so at this point our CFO Tina

04:52:32.270 --> 04:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
over 4.3 billion in net profit from its
 
04:52:36.530 --> 04:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
Inception in 1935 to fiscal year 2020.
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the chart on the bottom for net
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
profit is the history from 2013 to 2020.
 
04:52:49.128 --> 04:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the growth in 2021 was
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
significant so we have a decrease in FY
 
04:52:55.970 --> 04:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
22 which still is in line with the
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
regular Trend in history when you look
 
04:53:02.810 --> 04:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.970 --> 04:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
the next slide Revenue Trends in
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
transfer language this one is important
 
04:53:08.930 --> 04:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
because we just want to make sure
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
everybody is aware where our funds are
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
transferred to so there are two rsas
 
04:53:16.490 --> 04:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
governing Revenue transfers that are
 
04:53:18.050 --> 04:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
prior to our transfer to the general
 
04:53:18.060 --> 04:53:19.850 align:start position:0%
prior to our transfer to the general
fund

04:53:19.850 --> 04:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:53:24.650 --> 04:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
the first RSA is 176.16 and this is
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
calculated bellystone five percent of
 
04:53:29.930 --> 04:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
our prior year gross profits and that is
 
04:53:29.940 --> 04:53:31.330 align:start position:0%
our prior year gross profits and that is
transferred

04:53:31.330 --> 04:53:31.340 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:53:35.810 --> 04:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
to the alcohol fund and the other one is
 
04:53:35.820 --> 04:53:37.150 align:start position:0%
to the alcohol fund and the other one is
RSA

04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:53:40.490 --> 04:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
126aa and this one is not in our Revenue
 
04:53:43.550 --> 04:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
plan because during the year the fiscal
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
year HHS has to calculate to ensure that
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
they have sufficient non-federal funds
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the granted Advantage Health Care and
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund and at that point when they
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
ask for additional funds we transferred
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
last year it was eight million dollars
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
the next slide is our revenue and
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
expenses it's a five-year history our FY
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
22 Revenue as we said has decreased but
 
04:54:15.288 --> 04:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
is in a normal trend of our historic
 
04:54:18.288 --> 04:54:18.298 align:start position:0%
growth our expenses are consistent with
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
our expense to revenue ratio it's around
 
04:54:24.910 --> 04:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.010 --> 04:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
on slide 15 the revenue history by
 
04:54:30.410 --> 04:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
category our revenue is broken down into
 
04:54:33.050 --> 04:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
three sources you have beer tax and
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
permits the liquor and wine revenue and
 
04:54:36.770 --> 04:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
then we have other Revenue which
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
includes licensing Lottery direct
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
shipping permits and other miscellaneous
 
04:54:41.520 --> 04:54:45.948 align:start position:0%
shipping permits and other miscellaneous
Revenue

04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
slide 16 is a history of beer tax in
 
04:54:52.690 --> 04:54:52.700 align:start position:0%
gallonage as with the sale of alcohol
 
04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
beer tax had an increase in FY 21 but is
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
back to the normal levels at in FY 22 at
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
on slide 17 it's our sales by customer
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
type and by category so you'll see on
 
04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
the top line that retail is 383 million
 
04:55:20.330 --> 04:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
or 50 percent of our sales wine for
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
retail is 173 million or 22.6 percent so
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
our total retail is 556 million or 72.7
 
04:55:32.570 --> 04:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales and if you look at
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
the two pie charts they're broken down
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
by Spears and by wine by those
 
04:55:39.170 --> 04:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
categories so you'll see that retail
 
04:55:42.530 --> 04:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
Spirits are 85 percent of that category
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
and on this wine side the retail is
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.520 --> 04:55:51.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry on premise is a restaurant
 
04:56:01.970 --> 04:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
so where you go in and you consume
 
04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
on-premise and off-premises the grocery
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
stores where you buy the product to take
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh the next is uh the top 15 Outlets
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
so the top 15 Outlets equate for 51
 
04:56:21.010 --> 04:56:21.020 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales for a total of
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
305.7 million
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
and in that we have seven of our
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
state-owned stores that are in the top
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
15 and they equate to 150.6 million of
 
04:56:31.920 --> 04:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
15 and they equate to 150.6 million of
that

04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
and this next slide is um the agency
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
stores we have three agency licenses uh
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
one was issued in 2003 and then two of
 
04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
them that were issued in 2005. uh
 
04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
you have two in the North country and
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
one in the southern part of the state
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that there were no sales
 
04:56:56.690 --> 04:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
for the arrow location because they are
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
under construction due to a loss of the
 
04:57:03.050 --> 04:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.970 --> 04:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
and with that we're on to the marketing
 
04:57:12.490 --> 04:57:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
what is an agency store
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
there was a time
 
04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
when the Liquor Commission was looking
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of diversify
 
04:57:26.330 --> 04:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
mainly because they weren't as
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
profitable as they should be and they
 
04:57:33.170 --> 04:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
didn't really run the outlets we didn't
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
have a brand we didn't have a look we
 
04:57:37.250 --> 04:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
didn't have a feel that's all changed
 
04:57:39.650 --> 04:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
and at that point The Liquor Commission
 
04:57:43.208 --> 04:57:43.218 align:start position:0%
had given out these licenses to private
 
04:57:46.850 --> 04:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
retailers private entrepreneurs to run
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
stores in areas that the Liquor
 
04:57:51.050 --> 04:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
Commission didn't feel they could be
 
04:57:51.060 --> 04:57:52.310 align:start position:0%
Commission didn't feel they could be
profitable

04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
thus Pittsburgh arrow and Greenville at
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
obviously that cross-border creep is is
 
04:58:01.730 --> 04:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
important to us but that store is there
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
and and we uh you know we quantify that
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
license by it's been there a long time
 
04:58:09.650 --> 04:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
we haven't really uh we haven't put out
 
04:58:11.690 --> 04:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
an agency store license in many many
 
04:58:14.810 --> 04:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
years uh the Pittsburgh agency store
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
went out for bid last year because it
 
04:58:19.730 --> 04:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
was sold and you cannot transfer an
 
04:58:22.610 --> 04:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
agency store license it has to be it has
 
04:58:25.250 --> 04:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
to be an RFP and it has to be bid on so
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
it ended up in the same location in
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and young store where it's
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
always been
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.448 --> 04:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take you through the
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
marketing merchandising distribution and
 
04:58:44.280 --> 04:58:45.350 align:start position:0%
marketing merchandising distribution and
Warehouse

04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
Warehouse
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll start on page 21. currently we
 
04:58:50.690 --> 04:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
operate 68 retail outlets around the
 
04:58:53.330 --> 04:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
state and we have as mentioned before uh
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
two warehouses our DHL Warehouse in Beau
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
and our Concord warehouse and our
 
04:59:01.010 --> 04:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
Concord Warehouse is state-owned
 
04:59:02.930 --> 04:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
um we we have our state-owned and New
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made products there which
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
allows our New Hampshire products to
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
remain bailment free and bailment is
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
really just another word for rent and so
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
we do not charge bailment in that
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
warehouse for our New Hampshire made
 
04:59:16.020 --> 04:59:17.350 align:start position:0%
warehouse for our New Hampshire made
products

04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
products
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
merchandising is also part of the
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
division along with negotiating prices
 
04:59:25.490 --> 04:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
pricing and purchasing of all of our
 
04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
products for on and off-prem and of
 
04:59:29.448 --> 04:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
course advertising and communication
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:35.090 --> 04:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to step in here just for
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
a moment to to let you know that bailman
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a is if as Laurie said it's a rent
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's a fee charge to the Brokers that
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
store the product in the warehouse in
 
04:59:46.610 --> 04:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
Bow The Liquor Commission in the state
 
04:59:48.650 --> 04:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
does not own the product in the
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
warehouse in Beau it's owned by the
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
Brokers and it's owned by the suppliers
 
04:59:56.570 --> 04:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
and they pay DHL a rent in order to
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
store that product there The Liquor
 
05:00:01.490 --> 05:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
Commission does not take ownership of
 
05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
that product until the truck is loaded

attention to what people are saying
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
through Google and we do have 91 of our
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
reviews over time our four and five star
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
ratings and you can see just a quick
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
table there of how many have come in for
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
question now
 
05:07:39.120 --> 05:07:42.050 align:start position:0%
question now
Joe

05:07:42.050 --> 05:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
I have one more oh if you if you like
 
05:07:45.080 --> 05:07:46.810 align:start position:0%
I have one more oh if you if you like
okay

05:07:46.810 --> 05:07:46.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
and uh page 36 you can see here is just
 
05:07:52.730 --> 05:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
kind of a collection of charitable
 
05:07:52.740 --> 05:07:54.170 align:start position:0%
kind of a collection of charitable
contributions

05:07:54.170 --> 05:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
um we do love supporting our local
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
charities and since 2015 we've worked
 
05:08:01.490 --> 05:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
with suppliers and Brokers to raise
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
nearly 3.5 million dollars for
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
non-profits in the area
 
05:08:09.650 --> 05:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
that brings me to my last slide so I'm
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of things do you do you
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
do any television advertising we don't
 
05:08:20.930 --> 05:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
currently we do have video and most
 
05:08:22.850 --> 05:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
people will go to YouTube to watch the
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
video and we also put that in all of our
 
05:08:26.570 --> 05:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
Outlets we have video screens throughout
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
our Outlets so we do video but not
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
broadcast TV at this at this point okay
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I like that
 
05:08:35.090 --> 05:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
call further question
 
05:08:35.100 --> 05:08:36.110 align:start position:0%
call further question
yes

05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:08:36.120 --> 05:08:36.650 align:start position:0%
yes
um

05:08:36.650 --> 05:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:39.170 --> 05:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
just a comment I I like that that you
 
05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
picked up on the uh you know call in the
 
05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
order and you can come pick it up
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
because I I know the grocery stores are
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
all doing that yes yep it's very popular
 
05:08:50.510 --> 05:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
now and you know so we're seeing
 
05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
business come back people do want to
 
05:08:53.810 --> 05:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
come into the retail outlets and Shop
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
but there are some people that just feel
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
more comfortable pulling up to the curb
 
05:08:59.208 --> 05:08:59.218 align:start position:0%
and getting their their purchase that
 
05:09:00.650 --> 05:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
way so we want to accommodate everyone
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
who wants to do that this is a question
 
05:09:06.890 --> 05:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
um do you have any issues with what's I
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
think it's called shrink
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
it I have heard that no people are
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
walking out of the stores it's been I
 
05:09:17.810 --> 05:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
was that I was told that it was has been
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
a problem recently and I was just
 
05:09:22.610 --> 05:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was accurate or if you
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh if if it's a noticeable problem
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
well in certain locations it is but it
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
still remains a very minute number it's
 
05:09:35.208 --> 05:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
one half of one percent of our sales so
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's a very small number uh the chief
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
can speak to it a little bit when we
 
05:09:41.690 --> 05:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
come when he comes up but it's certainly
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
that has grown in recent years
 
05:09:49.010 --> 05:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
uh well that stirred some questions
 
05:09:54.410 --> 05:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to make a comment about
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
local New Hampshire made I think you
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
guys have done a great job over the last
 
05:10:01.730 --> 05:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
10 15 years with promoting local because
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
I years ago they really had an issue
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
especially the wineries with shelf space
 
05:10:08.810 --> 05:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the stores and you've done it great
 
05:10:10.970 --> 05:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
this this committee got the commission
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
to move the rack up to the front to the
 
05:10:15.890 --> 05:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
store when they have their own section
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
as well so thank you very much so
 
05:10:18.480 --> 05:10:25.208 align:start position:0%
as well so thank you very much so
representative

05:10:25.208 --> 05:10:25.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.530 --> 05:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
I had a question
 
05:10:30.890 --> 05:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
um as to a lot of times I will see as a
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
restaurant tour I will see people
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
pulling up and I will see them filling
 
05:10:37.250 --> 05:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
their entire Vans full of liquor with
 
05:10:39.170 --> 05:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
mass plates
 
05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
um what exactly is is if anything being
 
05:10:46.610 --> 05:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:48.410 --> 05:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
well there's there's nothing being done
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
to curtail it it's uh fair enough
 
05:10:55.850 --> 05:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's so so this has been an ongoing
 
05:10:59.330 --> 05:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
issue obviously we did have um one of
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
our counselors
 
05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
it was it was involved in in accusations
 
05:11:08.270 --> 05:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the store I myself did see uh in
 
05:11:10.550 --> 05:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
range I did see a North Carolina license
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
plate and people loading it up and and
 
05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
when I walked by they they you know gave
 
05:11:17.330 --> 05:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
me a very strange look and maybe because
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
I had a state plate and I drove in but
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
um the the obviously the the big issue
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
was the ten thousand dollar you know in
 
05:11:27.770 --> 05:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
terms of cash you know versus credit
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:33.170 --> 05:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
and and just to follow up on that Mr
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may The Liquor Commission
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
through the doj asked for an opinion
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
letter from the IRS and the IRS wrote us
 
05:11:42.230 --> 05:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
an opinion letter that the Liquor
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
Commission is within their realm of
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
doing business within the state of New
 
05:11:49.610 --> 05:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh regardless of the amount of
 
05:11:51.410 --> 05:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
sales that someone from out of state
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
buys right but I do notice that the
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
there used to be a big pile of a certain
 
05:11:55.980 --> 05:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
there used to be a big pile of a certain
uh

05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:00.770 --> 05:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh was it a whiskey no it was a Hennessy
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
that was Hennessy that was piled up by
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
the door uh and because range were a
 
05:12:07.550 --> 05:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
Border Town uh but that pile is gone now
 
05:12:10.128 --> 05:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
so that that either Hennessey's cut us
 
05:12:17.628 --> 05:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
takes change and times change so yes
 
05:12:20.160 --> 05:12:21.470 align:start position:0%
takes change and times change so yes
that

05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
this this question is based on my own
 
05:12:26.448 --> 05:12:26.458 align:start position:0%
ignorance and I have wanted to ask it
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
forever and now I have a captive group
 
05:12:31.550 --> 05:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
that can answer the question and it's a
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
silly little question when you have a
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
wine store
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
that's just dedicated to selling wine
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
are they licensed through the state of
 
05:12:41.570 --> 05:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or are they some other
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of thing no they're licensed
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
through the state representative all
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
licenses in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:12:49.368 --> 05:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
go through the The Liquor Commission I
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe they're 6400 licenses so they're
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
not one of these state agency things
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's a different thing that's correct
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
they are a private retail wine Outlet
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
right so so technically they're an
 
05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee correct so that
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
they would you know and I remember in
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
the old days we used to have beer stores
 
05:13:11.470 --> 05:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
but you know they've gone the way of
 
05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
Hannaford's Market Basket you know no
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they weren't successful anymore but
 
05:13:18.530 --> 05:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a handful of wine
 
05:13:20.930 --> 05:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
exclusive stores and you could
 
05:13:22.970 --> 05:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
open one yourself and be a licensing
 
05:13:22.980 --> 05:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
open one yourself and be a licensing
okay

05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:32.208 --> 05:13:32.218 align:start position:0%
and then representative thank you Mr
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question I I don't want
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
to rain on anybody's parade but when I
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
go into get a bottle of wine which I do
 
05:13:44.330 --> 05:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
frequently uh in the front of the store
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
these always these wines that are hugely
 
05:13:47.638 --> 05:13:48.948 align:start position:0%
these always these wines that are hugely
discounted

05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
discounted
 
05:13:50.810 --> 05:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
but they're wines that I don't know
 
05:13:54.890 --> 05:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
about I mean is is this some sort of a
 
05:13:57.410 --> 05:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
price switch or are these really quality
 
05:13:59.868 --> 05:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
wines every once in a while I buy one
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
but it's nothing I ever heard of are
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
these over socks from Italy or something
 
05:14:05.208 --> 05:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
well if you're talking about the price
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
Buster program or power by program yeah
 
05:14:11.090 --> 05:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
Price Plus yeah
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission the power buy
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
program is something that we've we've
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
done in the last seven or eight years
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
that we've asked Distributors we've
 
05:14:23.690 --> 05:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
asked the Brokers is there wines out
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
there that are quality number one
 
05:14:28.250 --> 05:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they're from but
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
they have to be discounted by 50 percent
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be into that program so that's why
 
05:14:35.448 --> 05:14:35.458 align:start position:0%
you're seeing high quality wines at 50
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
percent discounted rates
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome Representative
 
05:14:40.080 --> 05:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome Representative
Vincent

05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
Vincent
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:14:44.930 --> 05:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was under the
 
05:14:48.410 --> 05:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
assumption that uh it was 12 this one 12
 
05:14:48.420 --> 05:14:49.330 align:start position:0%
assumption that uh it was 12 this one 12
percent

05:14:49.330 --> 05:14:49.340 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:14:52.730 --> 05:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh for prevention and treatment and not
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
five percent is there any truth to that
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
sharing all this really interesting
 
05:15:11.700 --> 05:15:12.948 align:start position:0%
sharing all this really interesting
information

05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
I have a very basic question so on page
 
05:15:21.050 --> 05:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
18 it shows state-owned locations and I
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
was curious what are the other kind of
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
locations for example Seabrook I
 
05:15:28.970 --> 05:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
represent the Seacoast so what would the
 
05:15:32.448 --> 05:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
Seabrook location be categorized as it's
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
a state it's a state-run location but we
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't own the property representative we
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
have a landlord tenant releasing
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
releasing the location release that
 
05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
property from Market Basket owns that
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
the state runs the yes we we have a
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
25-year lease there but it's a real
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
estate underneath faith that you're
 
05:15:55.550 --> 05:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
leasing correct and the interesting
 
05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
story the history goes when I first got
 
05:16:00.490 --> 05:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
on this committee most of those leases
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
were below Market leases that the
 
05:16:06.650 --> 05:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
landlord literally gave gave it away to
 
05:16:12.650 --> 05:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.810 --> 05:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen thank you Mr
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for testifying uh
 
05:16:18.170 --> 05:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
presenting to us
 
05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
there was a period uh during and after
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic where Staffing was an issue
 
05:16:27.890 --> 05:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
and store hours were cut back could you
 
05:16:31.090 --> 05:16:31.100 align:start position:0%
give us the latest update on where those
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
issues stand
 
05:16:37.970 --> 05:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
well we're still down in staff by we
 
05:16:41.810 --> 05:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
a 14 vacancy rate right now 48 48 open
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
positions uh what we've done in House
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 is we've put in two two trailers
 
05:16:53.930 --> 05:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
in in the house bill one that allows us
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
to have a incentive program uh in in 20
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh 20 2011 under Governor Lynch we wrote
 
05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
an incentive program into House Bill 2
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
which was passed but we've never used it
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
we've never had a reason to use it uh
 
05:17:12.770 --> 05:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
now we're we're putting that incentive
 
05:17:16.368 --> 05:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
program into play and uh we hope to be
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
starting it at the end of this year we
 
05:17:22.490 --> 05:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
also put in uh
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the end of last year I'm still
 
05:17:28.930 --> 05:17:28.940 align:start position:0%
working in last year a little jet lag
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
and we've also asked for separate
 
05:17:35.708 --> 05:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
a separate
 
05:17:38.990 --> 05:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
lines in our budget to be able to
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
reclassify our people in the stores
 
05:17:44.330 --> 05:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
because our employees in the stores are
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
quite frankly woefully underpaid to the
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
percentage of retail in the state so
 
05:17:54.770 --> 05:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
what we've asked in House Bill 2 is that
 
05:17:58.490 --> 05:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
pay scale so we're allowed we're asking
 
05:18:01.610 --> 05:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to bring that pay scale up
 
05:18:05.448 --> 05:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
and reclassify those folks so they are
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
paid an average that is paid within the
 
05:18:12.830 --> 05:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
state so yes we are still understaffed
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
not as bad as we were at the time that
 
05:18:18.410 --> 05:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
we cut some hours and cut some stores
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
but our pay scale is still greatly
 
05:18:24.670 --> 05:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
beneath what we feel that it should be
 
05:18:28.490 --> 05:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
in order to attract employees to come to
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
work for this so so what is the starting
 
05:18:30.240 --> 05:18:31.448 align:start position:0%
work for this so so what is the starting
salary

05:18:31.448 --> 05:18:31.458 align:start position:0%
salary
 
05:18:36.368 --> 05:18:36.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
neither are we but we're doing our best
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
to to make those changes and the
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor has supported I I worked with
 
05:18:46.190 --> 05:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's office on the incentive
 
05:18:48.890 --> 05:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
program uh you know we went through a
 
05:18:51.050 --> 05:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
few iterations and we based it on
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
additional sales so we feel that the the
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
employees will be bonused on the
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
additional sales so that's a great start
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.810 --> 05:19:10.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon first just a quick
 
05:19:15.890 --> 05:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you uh the incentive
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
program could you just give us the high
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
level of what that is
 
05:19:21.410 --> 05:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
well the incentive program will be based
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
on a percentage of sales growth so uh if
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
if we grow the sales by a certain
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
percentage the employees will share 10
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
of that growth will be distributed
 
05:19:39.050 --> 05:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
amongst amongst the stores by region so
 
05:19:41.810 --> 05:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
there's seven regions and we have seven
 
05:19:44.448 --> 05:19:44.458 align:start position:0%
supervisors so some regions can hit it
 
05:19:47.570 --> 05:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
where others won't so it will be our
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
idea was in doing it that the regions
 
05:19:52.610 --> 05:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
would work together the stores in that
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
region would work together to lift
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
everyone's boat and lift the sails and
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
everyone in that region would enjoy
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
those additional sales and it would
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
create a little bit of competition
 
05:20:06.770 --> 05:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
between the stores in order to increase
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
sales in all areas it's it could be
 
05:20:11.810 --> 05:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
different a store in the North country
 
05:20:16.010 --> 05:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
can gain as much as as an agency I mean
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
a store in this in the southern part of
 
05:20:20.510 --> 05:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state given by region
 
05:20:24.410 --> 05:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
so it's ten percent of the increase
 
05:20:26.690 --> 05:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
05:20:26.700 --> 05:20:28.368 align:start position:0%
and obviously
that

05:20:28.368 --> 05:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:32.230 --> 05:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
in addition to changing the pay scale
 
05:20:34.910 --> 05:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
and changing the descriptions of those
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
jobs should be more than the incentive
 
05:20:40.490 --> 05:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
that we need to hire additional
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
employees and keep our employees that
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
are in place paid at a scale that we
 
05:20:50.090 --> 05:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
feel is is more in line with other
 
05:20:53.690 --> 05:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
retailers like-minded retailers
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
05:20:56.340 --> 05:20:57.170 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
um

05:20:57.170 --> 05:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
how when is this going to occur I mean
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
05:21:04.368 --> 05:21:04.378 align:start position:0%
12 bucks is
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
grossly underpaid for sure but
 
05:21:11.090 --> 05:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
um is there a schedule as to when this
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
these things will hit the incentive
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
program started in January so we started
 
05:21:18.770 --> 05:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
it now and it will go it'll be paid
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
every quarter so it will end in March
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be we're making the first
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
payouts in June it's not so 90 days
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
after that so employees will see those
 
05:21:30.650 --> 05:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
first checks in June of this year but in
 
05:21:33.410 --> 05:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
the base pay raise is that something the
 
05:21:35.448 --> 05:21:35.458 align:start position:0%
base pay raises
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
part of the budget is prior to the
 
05:21:37.378 --> 05:21:41.750 align:start position:0%
part of the budget is prior to the
budget

05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.760 --> 05:21:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:46.250 --> 05:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome very
 
05:21:47.570 --> 05:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
informative thank you

he's still around yes he's probably
 
05:22:36.110 --> 05:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
watching us right now we gave him a
 
05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
little plug there's no doubt he's
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
watching it
 
05:22:39.600 --> 05:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
watching it
um

05:22:41.690 --> 05:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:43.490 --> 05:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
first we'll start off with our mission
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
and our vision statement
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
um this is very important to us the way
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
we do business this administration's
 
05:22:52.610 --> 05:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
been together for six years
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
um we have changed the way we've done
 
05:22:56.208 --> 05:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
business so anything you know prior to
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
that know that we're doing business
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
differently and we're doing it better so
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement licensing
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
education is dedicated to educating the
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
public consumers students and license
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
holders about state liquor laws statutes
 
05:23:14.448 --> 05:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
along with Legal Financial social and
 
05:23:17.628 --> 05:23:17.638 align:start position:0%
health risks of abusing alcohol and
 
05:23:19.570 --> 05:23:19.580 align:start position:0%
that's very important to us
 
05:23:22.128 --> 05:23:22.138 align:start position:0%
furthermore the division administers
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
laws in a fair and uniform manner to
 
05:23:26.810 --> 05:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
work toward the elimination of underage
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
drinking thereby reducing the problems
 
05:23:31.550 --> 05:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
associated with underage consumptions
 
05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
and and that is something that we see
 
05:23:36.288 --> 05:23:36.298 align:start position:0%
quite often that we're working really
 
05:23:38.690 --> 05:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
diligently diligently on with our high
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
schools and I'll talk more about that as
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
we move on
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we have a three-prong approach as we
 
05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:23:48.890 --> 05:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
um uh our enforcement licensing and
 
05:23:51.770 --> 05:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
education from an enforcement standpoint
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
we inspect and regulate manufacture and
 
05:23:57.890 --> 05:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
just just distribution and retail sales
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
of alcohol and and tobacco products from
 
05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
a licensing purview we provide guidance
 
05:24:07.730 --> 05:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
to business through the application
 
05:24:10.490 --> 05:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
licensure process and I could tell you
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we just had yesterday one of our
 
05:24:15.470 --> 05:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
licensing Specialists go out into the
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
field and actually sit down with a
 
05:24:19.850 --> 05:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
prospective license a and help them
 
05:24:21.170 --> 05:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
through the process because they didn't
 
05:24:24.590 --> 05:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
have a computer so this is a customer
 
05:24:28.690 --> 05:24:28.700 align:start position:0%
service is very uh a very high standard
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
to us and what we provide to our
 
05:24:34.570 --> 05:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
prospective licensees education
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
we partner with stakeholders on
 
05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
awareness education of alcohol laws
 
05:24:43.310 --> 05:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
administering the rules and responsible
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
business practices and at the end of the
 
05:24:48.770 --> 05:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
day help them mitigate the risks that go
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
along with the sales of alcohol and
 
05:24:50.520 --> 05:24:53.448 align:start position:0%
along with the sales of alcohol and
tobacco

05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.170 --> 05:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
to our our staffing levels talk about
 
05:25:00.288 --> 05:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
the sworn Staffing levels first just to
 
05:25:04.368 --> 05:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
give you a cliff no version of in 2009
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
our staffing totals were at 26 sworn
 
05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
members so as we talk about our sworn
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
members there sworn police officers in
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire they have
 
05:25:17.208 --> 05:25:17.218 align:start position:0%
full jurisdiction but we keep them
 
05:25:19.550 --> 05:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
between the book markers of alcohol and
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco enforcement
 
05:25:26.350 --> 05:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
in 2011 we we
 
05:25:29.690 --> 05:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
had mandated cuts and we had a reduction
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
of our Force five positions and and
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
moving down to 2022 where we are today
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
or or at the end of the last year we're
 
05:25:42.850 --> 05:25:42.860 align:start position:0%
at a total of 21 sworn full-time
 
05:25:46.010 --> 05:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement investigators in seven
 
05:25:48.170 --> 05:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
part-time positions we have two openings
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
at this point civilian Staffing we do
 
05:25:53.090 --> 05:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
have civilian Staffing also they are
 
05:25:57.410 --> 05:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
auditor years and we have 12 in 2022 we
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
have 12 full-time
 
05:26:02.810 --> 05:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
staff there for part-time and we have
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
one current opening so when we talk
 
05:26:08.330 --> 05:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
about the Personnel in the division that
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
have oversight of the three-prong
 
05:26:13.510 --> 05:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
approach we are looking at
 
05:26:17.050 --> 05:26:17.060 align:start position:0%
implementing this to
 
05:26:21.050 --> 05:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
6718 licensees in this state and out of
 
05:26:22.610 --> 05:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
state because we have direct shippers
 
05:26:25.788 --> 05:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
that we have oversight over also with
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
full time for I'm sorry 15 full-time
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
investigators with a ratio of
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
447.8 or almost
 
05:26:41.090 --> 05:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:47.930 --> 05:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh liquor licensees on page 41 uh
 
05:26:50.448 --> 05:26:50.458 align:start position:0%
license types as this committee well
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
knows uh we have 52 license types uh
 
05:26:56.690 --> 05:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
available uh we talk about them quite
 
05:26:58.610 --> 05:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
often here
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
um the criteria for each license is
 
05:27:04.030 --> 05:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
established by Statute
 
05:27:07.368 --> 05:27:07.378 align:start position:0%
and liquor state liquor rules generally
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
licenses can be separated into two
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
categories which great question on
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
premise where alcohol is sold uh are
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
consumed on the premise so like Tina
 
05:27:21.530 --> 05:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
said there'll be restaurant lounge brew
 
05:27:25.730 --> 05:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
pubs Social Clubs and off-premise where
 
05:27:27.948 --> 05:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
alcohol can be taken off the premise to
 
05:27:30.650 --> 05:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
be consumed convenience stores grocery
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
stores uh retail wine outlets like was
 
05:27:36.288 --> 05:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
05:27:39.530 --> 05:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
moving to page 42 this gives you a
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
snapshot of where we are or where we
 
05:27:43.550 --> 05:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
were year end
 
05:27:46.090 --> 05:27:46.100 align:start position:0%
um with our licenses license types
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
on-premise uh you can see the numbers
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
there as it breaks down
 
05:27:55.270 --> 05:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
um our 6718 license types
 
05:27:58.670 --> 05:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
our largest is our on-premise uh
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
off-premise at almost 1500 direct
 
05:28:04.030 --> 05:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
shippers which are out of state
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
licensees they're shipping directly into
 
05:28:10.010 --> 05:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
this state to you the consumer uh we
 
05:28:13.810 --> 05:28:13.820 align:start position:0%
have 1400 of those manufacturers we have
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
807 tobacco only which is separate from
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
a grocery store convenience store which
 
05:28:24.288 --> 05:28:24.298 align:start position:0%
can sell tobacco also we have 229 and
 
05:28:26.890 --> 05:28:26.900 align:start position:0%
then our seasonals are
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
671 and like I said earlier that gives
 
05:28:30.970 --> 05:28:30.980 align:start position:0%
us our
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
6718. looking at the revenue
 
05:28:39.470 --> 05:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
um from our beer tax and permits we're
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
looking at approximately just over 13
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:28:50.510 --> 05:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
liquor license fees uh almost 33
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
000 uh I'm sorry 3 million 600 just
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
under 3 million 600 direct shipping uh
 
05:28:59.330 --> 05:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
almost 2 million
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
um uh and then down to our overall title
 
05:29:07.250 --> 05:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
which is just our total is just under 19
 
05:29:09.650 --> 05:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
so our education ever efforts are huge
 
05:29:19.550 --> 05:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
and and we keep them very near and dear
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
to our hearts public awareness and
 
05:29:21.360 --> 05:29:23.208 align:start position:0%
to our hearts public awareness and
education

05:29:23.208 --> 05:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:29:26.930 --> 05:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
um we have our number one uh requested
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh education platform is our fatal
 
05:29:31.730 --> 05:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
choices which is an impaired driving
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
simulator we use
 
05:29:36.650 --> 05:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
um a two golf carts that we have
 
05:29:39.288 --> 05:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
obtained through grants with our fatal
 
05:29:42.288 --> 05:29:42.298 align:start position:0%
vision goggles uh fondly known as drunk
 
05:29:46.128 --> 05:29:46.138 align:start position:0%
goggles to go to take students of
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
defensive driving courses
 
05:29:53.208 --> 05:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
um and uh and driving courses throughout
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
the state that are in high schools to
 
05:29:57.170 --> 05:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
teach them what the adverse effects of
 
05:29:59.708 --> 05:29:59.718 align:start position:0%
driving while impaired are
 
05:30:03.770 --> 05:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
we figure that uh student parents are
 
05:30:06.170 --> 05:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
the best teachers of their students and
 
05:30:08.090 --> 05:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes our kids need to touch the
 
05:30:10.490 --> 05:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
stove to see if that that it's hot so
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
we're giving we'll give them a safe
 
05:30:15.890 --> 05:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
platform to see that the adverse effects
 
05:30:18.830 --> 05:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
of drinking alcohol and driving could
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
create a a fatal situation our community
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
outreach vehicle we have obtained two
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
computerized drunk driving simulators
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
through nabka Grant one of them is
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
inside of that community outreach
 
05:30:34.490 --> 05:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle if you look at it as the
 
05:30:34.500 --> 05:30:35.650 align:start position:0%
vehicle if you look at it as the
bookmobile

05:30:35.650 --> 05:30:35.660 align:start position:0%
bookmobile
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of community-based things
 
05:30:41.570 --> 05:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
on the side of it but inside it gives a
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
nice view of alcohol awareness
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
it has an intoxilizer breath machine
 
05:30:52.128 --> 05:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
inside of it but more more than anything
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
else it has another drunk driving or
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
impaired driving simulator inside of it
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
our buyers beware program
 
05:31:04.970 --> 05:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
we we doing partnership with the
 
05:31:07.330 --> 05:31:07.340 align:start position:0%
coalitions throughout the state
 
05:31:07.340 --> 05:31:09.250 align:start position:0%
coalitions throughout the state
where

05:31:09.250 --> 05:31:09.260 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:31:11.690 --> 05:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:31:14.448 --> 05:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
taken our campaign on public awareness
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
and bumped it up a notch and we're at
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we're educating adults about the
 
05:31:21.288 --> 05:31:21.298 align:start position:0%
dangers and consequences of providing
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
alcohol to minors and and some of you
 
05:31:26.990 --> 05:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
that heard me talk last week on our
 
05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
radio show uh with Jack Heath know that
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know this is a huge problem
 
05:31:33.970 --> 05:31:33.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and that's
 
05:31:36.890 --> 05:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
empowering our kids to consume alcohol
 
05:31:39.890 --> 05:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
prior to the legal age to do that and
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
that has happened throughout this day
 
05:31:43.610 --> 05:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
and we've had negative incidents with it
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
so we believe that the more awareness
 
05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
out there and educating our parents
 
05:31:51.530 --> 05:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
what those negative and adverse effects
 
05:31:55.090 --> 05:31:55.100 align:start position:0%
are that we can we can combat that
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
presentations we do so many
 
05:31:59.208 --> 05:31:59.218 align:start position:0%
presentations and I'll get into that
 
05:32:02.090 --> 05:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
next uh present or down couple Pages
 
05:32:05.330 --> 05:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
presentations in schools usually more so
 
05:32:08.570 --> 05:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
around uh prom and
 
05:32:12.590 --> 05:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
um uh graduation time
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
um we we bring our investigator out with
 
05:32:19.128 --> 05:32:19.138 align:start position:0%
us who is our our mascot
 
05:32:21.170 --> 05:32:21.180 align:start position:0%

um and and it's really one of those
 
05:32:27.288 --> 05:32:27.298 align:start position:0%
things that puts a smile on everybody's
 
05:32:30.350 --> 05:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
face everybody likes to see a mascot
 
05:32:32.448 --> 05:32:32.458 align:start position:0%
um our one of our greatest Partners the
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
Fisher Cats we have we're part of their
 
05:32:35.280 --> 05:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
Fisher Cats we have we're part of their
mascot

05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
mascot
 
05:32:40.970 --> 05:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
um uh competition uh yearly and and it
 
05:32:43.850 --> 05:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
it does bring a lot of smiles and and a
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of awareness out to to our
 
05:32:50.868 --> 05:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
um our citizens of this state on page 44
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh continuation with our education
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
efforts so that was the public uh
 
05:33:00.410 --> 05:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
training that we do we also train those
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
that sell alcohol in this state at every
 
05:33:05.208 --> 05:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
level so
 
05:33:08.090 --> 05:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
um the managers uh managers training
 
05:33:11.570 --> 05:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
seminar is four of all of our owners and
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
managers throughout the state of that
 
05:33:16.490 --> 05:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
are licenses so
 
05:33:18.890 --> 05:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
um and that is mandated by Statute 45
 
05:33:23.208 --> 05:33:23.218 align:start position:0%
days after they obtain a license they
 
05:33:25.690 --> 05:33:25.700 align:start position:0%
have to go through this training segment
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
moving down to our Grocers education
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
seminar again this is specifically for
 
05:33:33.000 --> 05:33:34.090 align:start position:0%
seminar again this is specifically for
Grocers

05:33:34.090 --> 05:33:34.100 align:start position:0%
Grocers
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
and clerks
 
05:33:42.550 --> 05:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing those outward signs of
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
intoxication that they don't have to
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
sell to people that are are showing
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
signs of intoxication but also talking
 
05:33:55.490 --> 05:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
about IDs and and fictitious IDs because
 
05:33:59.208 --> 05:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
we do training on fictitious IDs also
 
05:34:01.490 --> 05:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
um our total education in alcohol
 
05:34:04.448 --> 05:34:04.458 align:start position:0%
management are for all of our servers
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
and all of our servers servers
 
05:34:10.930 --> 05:34:10.940 align:start position:0%
throughout the state do an awesome job
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
this training is actually given in
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
person or online all these platforms are
 
05:34:18.430 --> 05:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
given in both
 
05:34:24.110 --> 05:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
both venues just to to make it uh easier
 
05:34:28.010 --> 05:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
for the user to to take this training
 
05:34:31.490 --> 05:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
whether it's a refresher every year
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um or or that they actually want to come
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
down and and be part of one of our uh
 
05:34:43.850 --> 05:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
moving at page 45
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
um again uh we're not
 
05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
separate from anybody else we do the
 
05:34:54.770 --> 05:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
same training for our liquor and wine
 
05:34:54.780 --> 05:34:56.390 align:start position:0%
same training for our liquor and wine
outlets

05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
um and and also our clerks are trained
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
the very same way that we would train
 
05:35:04.850 --> 05:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
anybody else and and those outward signs
 
05:35:07.368 --> 05:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
of intoxication and fictitious
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
identification again we're trying to
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
help our licensees we've partnered with
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
them every day of the week to show them
 
05:35:18.530 --> 05:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
that we're there to help them mitigate
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
the risks that are involved in selling
 
05:35:21.000 --> 05:35:22.368 align:start position:0%
the risks that are involved in selling
alcohol

05:35:22.368 --> 05:35:22.378 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh moving down to our let's training
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
that's uh more if I can kind of dummy
 
05:35:32.330 --> 05:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
that down a little bit it's security
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
training but it's for the bouncers of uh
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
these establishments again we we in
 
05:35:41.208 --> 05:35:41.218 align:start position:0%
enforcement feel that on our sworn side
 
05:35:43.850 --> 05:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
of the house those people that work in
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
those venues are our first line and and
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're seeing whatever has I hate to
 
05:35:53.930 --> 05:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
say it but gone sideways and and they
 
05:35:56.090 --> 05:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
are great partners of ours and and we
 
05:35:57.470 --> 05:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're all on the
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
same page and again we're looking at
 
05:36:01.610 --> 05:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
risk and we're helping them mitigate
 
05:36:03.530 --> 05:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
risk because there is a lot of risk into
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
that field uh fictitious ID training I
 
05:36:09.470 --> 05:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
talked about and those Trends change as
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
much as the IDS that come from overseas
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
change so
 
05:36:17.690 --> 05:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
um any time that there is something new
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're on top of it we have National
 
05:36:22.010 --> 05:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
partners that help us out with that so
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
we're getting getting state-of-the-art
 
05:36:23.580 --> 05:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
we're getting getting state-of-the-art
training

05:36:25.030 --> 05:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
training
 
05:36:28.368 --> 05:36:28.378 align:start position:0%
on what are the new trends that we're
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:34.970 --> 05:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
moving to our educate page 46 our
 
05:36:37.910 --> 05:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
education and awareness here you'll see
 
05:36:40.368 --> 05:36:40.378 align:start position:0%
the breakdown our licensee training
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've done 63 live classes with 850
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
students and that second bullet point we
 
05:36:49.570 --> 05:36:49.580 align:start position:0%
have trained
 
05:36:54.890 --> 05:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
2870 people via our online so we're
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
really proud of opening up that online
 
05:36:58.850 --> 05:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
platform because I think we're getting
 
05:37:00.850 --> 05:37:00.860 align:start position:0%
out to more people that way
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
our Liquor Outlet employees again we
 
05:37:07.368 --> 05:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
give the same training only specific to
 
05:37:10.510 --> 05:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
their needs 45 live
 
05:37:16.490 --> 05:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
Lots classes with 343 students
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the second bullet point there 645 had
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
been trained online through that
 
05:37:25.368 --> 05:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
platform a total person's trained of
 
05:37:25.378 --> 05:37:28.010 align:start position:0%
platform a total person's trained of
4708

05:37:28.010 --> 05:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
4708

05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
since 2010 when we started this program
 
05:39:37.850 --> 05:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
and we started this this branding of the
 
05:39:39.288 --> 05:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission we've been very
 
05:39:42.410 --> 05:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
successful and we really appreciate
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%

support we can't do what we do so thank
 
05:39:49.610 --> 05:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
you very much and again we'd be happy to
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you I often wondered and I have
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
been to these events
 
05:40:01.128 --> 05:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
um the wine tasting events the large
 
05:40:03.708 --> 05:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
ones and the distilleries
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
um event it's usually in Manchester I
 
05:40:06.000 --> 05:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
um event it's usually in Manchester I
believe

05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:40:09.050 --> 05:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of alcohol consumption
 
05:40:11.448 --> 05:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
there so I'm not sure how you regulate
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
the people that are tasting because I
 
05:40:18.050 --> 05:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.330 --> 05:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
well we we do it a number of ways
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
everybody who's serving alcohol there is
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:40:26.690 --> 05:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
to serve alcohol so they've all gone
 
05:40:29.570 --> 05:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
they're all mainly their broker
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers and and retailers and we also
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a support team of enforcement at
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
those events we do have very very little
 
05:40:42.830 --> 05:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
issues at those events as they go people
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
are very conscious about you know
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
drinking and driving for the most part
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
in general but at those events events
 
05:40:49.920 --> 05:40:52.330 align:start position:0%
in general but at those events events
specifically

05:40:52.330 --> 05:40:52.340 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but we do have that Sip and stay
 
05:40:58.970 --> 05:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
we have the Sip and stay responsibly so
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
they get uh they have a discounted room
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
rate in the in the in the hotel and we
 
05:41:08.930 --> 05:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
also have uh a limousine company that
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
offers rides as well
 
05:41:15.770 --> 05:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
we give credit to that to Lori she's the
 
05:41:20.690 --> 05:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
backbone behind that I just want to say
 
05:41:23.330 --> 05:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
one thing I I know that you know when
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
people run a business of that size no
 
05:41:27.770 --> 05:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
one runs a business of this size by
 
05:41:31.010 --> 05:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
themselves we literally have a huge team
 
05:41:34.430 --> 05:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
of people of 1200 people people in the
 
05:41:36.650 --> 05:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
stores people in enforcement and people
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
at headquarters this is a great team of
 
05:41:41.570 --> 05:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
folks who are sincerely dedicated with
 
05:41:44.208 --> 05:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
what they do and I personally could not
 
05:41:46.490 --> 05:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
do it without all their help and
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
especially the senior team that's here
 
05:41:53.180 --> 05:41:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:53.190 --> 05:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:41:54.550 --> 05:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:41:57.410 --> 05:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you guys very much thank you very
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
much uh for the committee members before
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
you all depart uh we have we have
 
05:42:04.850 --> 05:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
shuffled the deck a little bit
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
um so you guys will some of you will be
 
05:42:08.448 --> 05:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
moving back and forth because I just
 
05:42:09.708 --> 05:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was right to have all
 
05:42:11.690 --> 05:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
women on one side and Men on the other
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
side that was totally unintentional I've
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
been so uh trained in how to make sure I
 
05:42:18.890 --> 05:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
mix it up between Republicans and
 
05:42:21.230 --> 05:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
Democrats like that I wasn't paying
 
05:42:24.170 --> 05:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
attention to the first names only to the
 
05:42:26.470 --> 05:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
categories of the columns
 
05:42:29.570 --> 05:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so for next for we're not we
 
05:42:31.550 --> 05:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
know meet tomorrow we meet Thursday
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
Thursday no so Thursday is going to be
 
05:42:36.890 --> 05:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
our first uh hearings
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things I would hope
 
05:42:41.628 --> 05:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
you all will think about
 
05:42:44.510 --> 05:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
um is that we do divide the committee up
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
into three subcommittees three divisions
 
05:42:51.530 --> 05:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
so the divisions are insurance
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh which will be both property and
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
casually and health insurance
 
05:42:58.730 --> 05:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
um uh liquor
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
and as you can see that uh
 
05:43:05.208 --> 05:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
that's obviously the most fun right but
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh we're there by I would have to you
 
05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
know give notice that there might be a
 
05:43:11.448 --> 05:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
special task this year
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
um if if uh if it happens the way it's
 
05:43:15.890 --> 05:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen
 
05:43:17.448 --> 05:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
um we would be getting the marijuana
 
05:43:19.550 --> 05:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be going to the liquor
 
05:43:25.610 --> 05:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee uh subdivision and then uh and
 
05:43:26.948 --> 05:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
last word is what we call business
 
05:43:30.530 --> 05:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
business and and just all this so if you
 
05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
look at the Attorney General the
 
05:43:37.150 --> 05:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
consumer and Banking and condos
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think what else we now
 
05:43:42.530 --> 05:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
have 27 bills
 
05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
um so all those would go into the the
 
05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
the the Third
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
division third division so think about
 
05:43:50.690 --> 05:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
which ones you want to be in and then
 
05:43:53.330 --> 05:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
and then email me and let me know and
 
05:43:55.850 --> 05:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
we'll be putting that together
 
05:44:00.170 --> 05:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
um so uh 2017 is pretty light
 
05:44:01.730 --> 05:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
um they're theoretically probably will
 
05:44:04.010 --> 05:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
be more com subcommittee uh more bills
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
coming in and then we'll I'll try to
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
push through the hearings and get the
 
05:44:10.430 --> 05:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
hearings done quickly and then we get
 
05:44:12.288 --> 05:44:12.298 align:start position:0%
into the subcommittees and really thrash
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
out the bills
 
05:44:17.208 --> 05:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
um we uh my I absolutely plan to be
 
05:44:18.830 --> 05:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
taking the vacation week because I
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
already have my my trip to Virgin Gorda
 
05:44:24.410 --> 05:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
Virgin Gorda booked hi Mr chairman what
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
week is that so that is uh theoretically
 
05:44:30.650 --> 05:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
it's like the first week of March
 
05:44:33.048 --> 05:44:33.058 align:start position:0%
it's it ends end of February first week
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
of March it's in uh it's in the calendar
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
so the last thing I guess I want to make
 
05:44:42.288 --> 05:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
sure I introduce our committee assistant
 
05:44:45.530 --> 05:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
who sits in the back and Kristen is uh
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
Chris and Grant is um he's been doing
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
this now how many years now three or
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:44:50.638 --> 05:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
three years
and

05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.610 --> 05:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
um and she uh is is is already up to
 
05:44:58.620 --> 05:45:00.128 align:start position:0%
um and she uh is is is already up to
speed

05:45:00.128 --> 05:45:00.138 align:start position:0%
speed
 
05:45:03.170 --> 05:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
and uh and then and of course we have a
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
committee assistant now just so you
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
understand the roles of these two people
 
05:45:07.558 --> 05:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
understand the roles of these two people
technically

05:45:09.470 --> 05:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
technically
 
05:45:11.930 --> 05:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
um that you know your Carrie you'll hear
 
05:45:14.868 --> 05:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
about only with you are making uh the
 
05:45:16.670 --> 05:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
the motion the majority or minority
 
05:45:19.010 --> 05:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
motion on a bill and have to write a
 
05:45:19.020 --> 05:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
motion on a bill and have to write a
blurb

05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
blurb
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
um then you would then she'll she'll be
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking for that uh documentation
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
Kristen however is technically she is
 
05:45:29.570 --> 05:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
our committee system but you have to
 
05:45:34.010 --> 05:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
keep in mind she research excuse me
 
05:45:37.970 --> 05:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
is that she um is serves four committees
 
05:45:41.690 --> 05:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
right three three you got three
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
are you sharing it okay so
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
um so theoretically if there was a task
 
05:45:49.850 --> 05:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
that you think this would be great for
 
05:45:52.010 --> 05:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
her to do some research for you you have
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
to go through me you have to ask me and
 
05:45:56.810 --> 05:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
talk to me first and then I will give
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
give the blessing to have it have it
 
05:45:58.920 --> 05:46:00.650 align:start position:0%
give the blessing to have it have it
accomplished

05:46:00.650 --> 05:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
05:46:04.250 --> 05:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and but she for No Doubt when we get
 
05:46:06.650 --> 05:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
into bills certainly there will be bills
 
05:46:09.410 --> 05:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
that uh we've had before and she'll have
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
have done the research and you'll get a
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%

what the history of that bill and you
 
05:46:18.770 --> 05:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
know where it is and they've been in
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and then of course when
 
05:46:22.610 --> 05:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
we get into committee conferences she'll
 
05:46:29.948 --> 05:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
