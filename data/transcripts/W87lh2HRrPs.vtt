00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative rawlings would be here
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.070 align:start position:0%
this morning
um

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
maybe he's afraid of us or something i
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're such
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful people i can't believe that
 
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
anyhow he
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
he did he did provide an amendment
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
that uh representative lynn
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
has um
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
sent out
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
this replaces
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
well what we heard
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
last week whenever that was
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
so this is a replacement uh amendment to
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
hb 1300.
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
so if you um
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
i i hope i i think i had sent this to
 
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.670 align:start position:0%
i i hope i i think i had sent this to
everyone

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
but

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.350 align:start position:0%
 
anyhow

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
the
yes

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i can hear you okay i don't know if
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
i was supposed to keep my no you're not
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
there you go then pick your finger up
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
you should be okay okay
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
so um if i remember correctly that
 
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.830 align:start position:0%
so um if i remember correctly that
um

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
the last time we met on this on this
 
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.309 align:start position:0%
the last time we met on this on this
bill

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
we wanted the
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
if there was any funds left over we
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
wanted them to go back into the general
 
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.550 align:start position:0%
wanted them to go back into the general
fund

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
no what i see on this what i see on this
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is it just goes back to des
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
moines yeah that was not this bill
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
that was um well that's still my
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
question about the amendment it's just
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like it just goes in circles
 
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.110 align:start position:0%
it seems like it just goes in circles
here

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
it's just if they don't if they don't
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
use all the money it goes back to des it
 
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't go back to general funds
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
it should go to the general funds
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it
 
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.110 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it
yeah

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
anyway that was my question okay okay
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
all right mickey mickey you said someone
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
was here from d.e.s

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
department here possibly to answer
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions i think they just saw this
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
amendment this morning earlier today for
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%

uh this is not the
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
not the norm for division two uh or
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%

i would as you know the department is
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this bill so
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just hoping i can answer any
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
you had a question i i did um and i i i
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
know that i
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to be asking you in some
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
of

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh or at least close to what i had asked
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
at the other hearing but i'm still not
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
quite sure i understand could you just
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
typically

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
what happens when a landfill
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
closes down in other words i know i
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
understand that there's this requirement
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
that you that the you know the owner
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
provide these financial assurances that
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
kind of thing but can you can you just
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
kind of run us through that generation
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
in other words suppose that a landfill
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
is owned by
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
some county or local level of government
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to close down sure
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
at the time that the permittee applied
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to build the landfill they
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
submitted a closure plan that was
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
approved by des so when they close down
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
they follow the steps that they have
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
and those can include things like
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then they follow steps to maintain
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
the closed landfill it includes
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
mowing the top of the landfill if the
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
landfill generates leachate like the ash
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
landfill then that leachate needs to be
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
collected and disposed of and the
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
collection system needs maintenance and
 
00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
collection system needs maintenance and
checking

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
checking
 
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.509 align:start position:0%
checking
um

00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
landfills generate hazardous gases
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
landfill gas so there are systems at the
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
landfills that control the migration of
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
those gases so those systems need to be
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
monitored and maintained we need to make
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure that gas isn't migrating
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere that it could pose a risk
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
there typically our groundwater
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring wells to check whether
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of materials in the
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
landfill are contaminating the
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater and could pose a risk to
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water so there's a schedule by
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
which the permatea needs to have those
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
wells sampled
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
financial assurance that they
 
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.750 align:start position:0%
financial assurance that they
demonstrate

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
is to demonstrate that
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
if they were to become insolvent
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's at least 30 years of money
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
available that the state could access to
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
pay for the continued maintenance and
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the landfill
 
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the landfill
okay

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
follow up so can i just
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
so again let's assume that the landfill
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is owned by
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
some level of government a county or
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
municipality or whatever so
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
when you say they have to provide
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
i mean what is that in other words do
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
they have to like post a bond or
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarifying question
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
because if the landfill is owned by a
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
government entity
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
they have the option of
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing the local government financial
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
test to demonstrate that
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
their entity has the money moving
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
forward in the future and then that
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
satisfies their financial assurance so a
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
public entity would not have to get
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
put in place the instruments that a
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
private entity would those instruments
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
for a private entity could be
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
a surety bond an insurance policy
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
a trust fund
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
an irrevocable letter of credit
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think the rules reference or other
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
mechanisms i asked our staff what other
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
mechanisms do we see and they told me on
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
rare occasion a certificate of deposit
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay can i ask one other follow-up
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
question so so let me turn it suppose
 
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
question so so let me turn it suppose
that

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i take it that with regard to a
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
to a municip to a municipality or some
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
level of government
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
the assurance basically would be
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
the level of government's taxing
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
authority we can if if we don't
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
if if something goes wrong here we have
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
to pay we're going to tax the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
inhabitants to pay for the i mean is
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
that basically correct
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
while that makes sense to me i have
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
never been the one to review a local
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
government financial tests so i would
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
really want to check with our finance
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
person to be sure but that is logical
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
all right can i ask one another oh yes
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's fine just one of the so let me
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
switch gears from it suppose that if
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is a privately owned landfill and
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
suppose that
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's in financial difficulties
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
in other words suppose the owners say
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand that the you know the
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
plan is we have to we have to have a
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
bond we don't have the money we can't
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to go bankrupt or
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
we don't just we don't have the money
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
what does des do then if they you know
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
suppose they investigated they find out
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they really don't have the money
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
what do you do then
 
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
what do you do then
well

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
the permittee was to demonstrate up
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
front before they got their permit that
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
they had the money
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
this econ situation is a very unique
 
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
this econ situation is a very unique
situation

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
so econ is the only one that i'm aware
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
of where they
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
had the sufficient money in the
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
rules and statutes of course um
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
give us authorities to enforce the rules
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
and statutes
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
but uh of course we'd rather find a
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm sorry yeah no no
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine
 
00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine
um

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
are there yes please go ahead
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
can you clarify because when you were
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
speaking here you used the phrase 30
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
years that they have to have money for
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
and if i can remember correctly from the
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
hearing before these people
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
believed they had 30 years they planned
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
out for 30 years and then somewhere
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
along the way the phrase a rolling yes
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
so when you said 30 years
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
did you mean 30 years because that seems
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
to be what they understood and that's
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
but now we hear that there's a rolling
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
30 years which is basically 30 years in
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
perpetuity so can you clarify that for
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
me sure that's a great question
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that are currently in effect require a
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
rolling 30 years and and the reason for
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is because a landfill does not
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
suddenly have no risks after 30 years
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
the risks continue although it's
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
possible that the cost of
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
managing them decreases over time
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
the rules were clarified in 2014 because
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
there was um confusion on
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
many parts
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
about whether that was a fixed 30 years
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
or a rolling 30 years
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
our position is that it has always meant
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
a role in 30 years
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that there was a lack of
 
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.550 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that there was a lack of
clarity

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
on both sides at the time that
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
the this permittee
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
if if i understand correctly
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
the they followed the rules that were in
 
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
the they followed the rules that were in
effect

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
in what was it 2011
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
when when they asked for the permit
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
or they identified what the what they
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
needed to do to close the landfill
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so they
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
put aside that money
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
and then later on
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
clarified the rules
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
you changed the or the des
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
des says
 
00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
des says
your

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
landfill closure plan
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
good enough you need an additional
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
x amount of money to take care of
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
30 more years
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
is that am i reading this correctly or
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
i know you said your initial rules you
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
thought that that's what it was well
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is the difficult
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
one of the difficult parts of this
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
situation our position is that
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
even in 2011 even 2009 that the rules
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
always meant a rolling 30 years but they
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
didn't state it clearly enough
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you as as econ points out if you look
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
back at the
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
information in their files and ours it
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
appears that there was a lack of clarity
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
on the des side as well as on the econ
 
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.710 align:start position:0%
on the des side as well as on the econ
side

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
please oh let's oh i'm sorry yeah
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative heath go ahead so my
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this entity
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
is a private entity it has it does not
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
have the capacity or taxing authority
 
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
have the capacity or taxing authority
so

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
right now the current situation is that
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
they use some of these funds
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
to maintain
this

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.029 align:start position:0%
this
landfill

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and now they're in a situation where
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're all volunteers
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's they're stuck
 
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
and it's they're stuck
so

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
does this amendment mean that 500 000
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.750 align:start position:0%
would be
put

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
in a fund at des
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
now

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the amendment is wonder if
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
this landfill
 
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.789 align:start position:0%
this landfill
fails

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
fails
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
and des has to take it over
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
so one way or another this is kind of a
 
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.669 align:start position:0%
so one way or another this is kind of a
conundrum

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
conundrum
 
00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:25.350 align:start position:0%
conundrum
um

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.549 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
why do we have to fix it
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer
[Laughter]

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
so your first question um about
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
where would the money go if it was
 
00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
where would the money go if it was
appropriated

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
econ does have a financial assurance
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism it just doesn't have enough
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
money in it so my understanding of the
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill is that the money would come to des
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we would immediately cut a check to
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
econ's trust fund which is held at
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
citizens bank right now they can always
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
move that around if they want to with
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
our approval
 
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
our approval
um

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where the money would go
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
on your second question what what
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
happens if
 
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.350 align:start position:0%
happens if
econ

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
econ
 
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.549 align:start position:0%
econ
dissolves

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
dissolves
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the landfill fails or or even what
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
happens for the maintenance if econ
 
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
happens for the maintenance if econ
dissolves

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
at that point we would what we could say
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
call financial assurance and start using
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
the trust fund whatever money is in it
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
to pay for whatever needed to be done
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the period of time that it lasted
 
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.510 align:start position:0%
for the period of time that it lasted
and

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
eventually it would run out
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the des does not have funds
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
dedicated to maintaining and monitoring
 
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:51.669 align:start position:0%
dedicated to maintaining and monitoring
landfills

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
but it would need to be maintained and
 
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.710 align:start position:0%
but it would need to be maintained and
monitored

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
monitored
 
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
monitored
so

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
des would look to the governor and the
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
legislature for for where that money
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
would need to come from
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for uh
 
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for uh
testifying

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
i have a series of questions if you
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't mind
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
first question is it the department's
 
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
first question is it the department's
position

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.310 align:start position:0%
position
that

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
the rule was not
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
changed but clarified in 2014 just yes
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
or no that is our position yes thank you
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay next question
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
can i continue oh yes ma'am yeah please
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
instead of asking this is a work session
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just learning about this and my
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
first introduction was an article i
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
pulled from september of last year on
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
this so i'm
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
using that as kind of a base uh
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
currently how much money is in
 
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
currently how much money is in
the

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund or whatever they're calling
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
it right now do you know i have notes on
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
what was last reported to us somewhere
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
around 800 000 is that correct
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.630 align:start position:0%
and
why

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
the reason we are here is that the
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
number that
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be maintained on a
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
is 9.92 correct
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
the 992 number is not one that i entered
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
into my notes
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
um but this is an important question
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh the amount that needs to be
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
maintained on the 30-year rolling basis
 
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
maintained on the 30-year rolling basis
is

00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
is calculated
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the closure
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
post-closure cost estimate that the
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
permittee is required to
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
update every three years and that
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
closure cost estimate is to be for a 30
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
year period
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do not we have not received
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
a post-closure cost estimate for for
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
this landfill
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
since 2016 and it was for 15 years not
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
for 30. so we really can't comment on
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the total amount needed is at this
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh we've been in in close communication
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
with econ
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i am aware from just yesterday's
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
communication that they've had an
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
engineer working on in a 30-year
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
post-closure estimate
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um it should be ready right around
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
now and they're interested in talking
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
with des about it and we'll definitely
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
make ourselves available but um
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't have the number
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's necessary you don't have a
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
current one what was the number
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the last estimate the
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
last estimate which was for only a
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
15-year period was
 
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
15-year period was
688

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
688
 
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
688
989

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that excuse me that was from
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
2016 to
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
2031. is that correct
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and final question
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
so it is the department's position that
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
once you get this new estimate that's
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
the total amount of funds that should be
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
in this rolling 30-year
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
number as of
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
now is that correct it's a little more
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
nuanced than that okay
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
once we get that updated estimate we
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
need to review it and
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
maybe the changes to it will just be
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
tweaking the numbers because the cost of
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
mowing has changed over the past five
 
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
mowing has changed over the past five
years

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
but perhaps and what happens sometimes
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps they will propose to change some
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the activities they're doing for
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
post-closure maintenance
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
in that case if it's a change to the
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
post-closure activities
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to need a more thorough
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
review by our engineers and we'll need
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
carefully through what they propose to
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
do and through what the calculations are
 
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
do and through what the calculations are
and

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.669 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
eventually we would
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
ask for changes or approve it based on
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
what we see it's too soon to know we
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what it'll contain
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
i lied that wasn't my final question you
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
just gave me a new one
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
so when you get and you redo your
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
estimates and the department
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
the current amount in the
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
we just talked about somewhere around
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
883 or whatever the number is
 
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.870 align:start position:0%
883 or whatever the number is
conceivably

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
conceivably
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
the department's number could come in
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to know because i i
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
don't know let me rephrase it it could
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
come in below or above that number
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i would say yes thank you
 
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
that's what i would say yes thank you
okay

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
represent petry
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you man of chair
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i got a couple of these beauties
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
next to me
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the cardinal landfill which i'm sure you
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
know nothing about but they have a trust
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
to take care of it and
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
like a blind trust
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
and they they take care of theirs
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
are they required to have the same
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
thing right next door to that one
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
is the town landfill
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
and they we we have we maintain a
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund and when
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
funds are needed we take it out of that
 
00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.630 align:start position:0%
funds are needed we take it out of that
so

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm surprised that
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
this uh this entity
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
has it by itself because it seems so the
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
town of newport should have the response
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
the responsibility because they probably
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
put the refuge there is that correct
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
this landfill
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually accepted ash that came from
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
municipal solid waste from a number of
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
different communities in new hampshire
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
and vermont
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
and at first
 
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.630 align:start position:0%
and at first
the

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the permittee for the landfill was the
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
the coalition of those communities
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
but um back in the early 2000s
 
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
but um back in the early 2000s
uh

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
econ took the landfill over
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
now if if econ fails all right
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you have insurance within
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
des of the bond or i assume it's a bond
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
now wouldn't the city of newport
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
they would inherit the land so to speak
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't they be responsible
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
to take care of it
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
we're getting into some legal questions
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you've been very
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
patient i'm sorry you know what can i
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to follow this through
 
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.630 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to follow this through
if

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
as i think i asked the last
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
the last time we had
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly there's no
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's no precedent for this and for
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
what what is being asked for here in the
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
sense that no other
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
no other
 
00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.389 align:start position:0%
no other
landfill

00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
has said
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
we misinterpreted
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
what the regulation meant as the 30
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
years rolling versus 30 years fixed is
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can say for sure what
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
all the other landfills have said but uh
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any other landfill
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
that finds themselves in this situation
 
00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.190 align:start position:0%
that finds themselves in this situation
yes

00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
so the thing i guess i'm having i'm
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
trying to sort of envision what
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
what kind of precedent this would set
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
in other words suppose that
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
suppose that the situation was you have
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
a landfill that you know got
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
they they gave you the appropriate
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
assurances for 30 years rolling and it
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
was you know x number of dollars
 
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.230 align:start position:0%
was you know x number of dollars
um

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
because of inflation or whatever the
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
call you know the costs of
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing the maintenance
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
went way up
 
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
went way up
would

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
would that mean that it would be okay
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
for that landfill to come to the
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and say we want
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know we want an appropriation to
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
bail us out i would think that might
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
have if that was a basis there might
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
that might happen with some regularity
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
well des is not taking a position on
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and and
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
but what i can offer is that there are
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
more than 400 closed landfills in the
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
state most of them are owned by
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
local entities
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
we estimate there are about 50 that are
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
owned by private entities and from what
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
we can tell econ may be the only
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
non-profit that owns a closed landfill
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you sarah
 
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.350 align:start position:0%
and thank you sarah
um

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
so my question is how did they how did
 
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
so my question is how did they how did
this

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
um organization
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
put the uh fund this trust
 
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
put the uh fund this trust
originally

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
and uh tom
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
let's save that question for uh mr
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
pinken uh well my question is if they if
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
they did if they depleted what they had
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
did they go to their own stakeholders
 
00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.870 align:start position:0%
did they go to their own stakeholders
first

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
or did they just come to the state i
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
think that's a question that um
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
the uh
nonprofit

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
needs to answer and will and and and by
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the way in the last time we met on this
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
i never heard this these numbers that
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
are being thrown around like the 883 000
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
balance that's still in there
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.269 align:start position:0%
that's true
yes

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like you know the 883 000 seems
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
like rather a lot of money
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i guess i have two questions related
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
to that if i
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
if i miss
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
remembering let me know it seems to me i
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
have the understanding that
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
because this kerfuffle arose
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
that des
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
was not releasing money for the um
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
the landfill to continue to do its work
 
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.310 align:start position:0%
the landfill to continue to do its work
and

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
first of all can you clarify that the
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
second thing is
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money to hold when it
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
seems like that landfill is not asking
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
for a lot of money in order to do its
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
yearly job
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
because regardless of
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
where the problem was des is a
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
professional group econ i guess is their
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
name of more of the volunteers and it
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
seems it's incumbent upon des to help
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
out here and be a little creative and
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
flexible in finding a solution
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that econ can do what it is that they
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
apparently are trying very hard to do
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
your your first question
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
a concept that
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
can be confusing
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the financial assurance mechanism the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
intended to be a debit account that pays
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance it's intended to sit
 
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.029 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance it's intended to sit
undisturbed

00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
to be there in the event that the
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
however

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
mechanism like a trust fund has more
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
money than is necessary to cover the
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
estimate for post-closure maintenance
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and monitoring
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
then the permittee can request for
 
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
then the permittee can request for
disbursements

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
disbursements
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's what had been happening leading
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
up to 2016
 
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.509 align:start position:0%
up to 2016
that

00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
des was authorizing disbursements from
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
the trust fund to help out with the
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
also a very unique situation
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
then it was in 2016 when the situation
 
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
then it was in 2016 when the situation
of

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
there not being enough money in the
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
trust fund arose
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and at that point in time we weren't
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
able to authorize any additional
 
00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
able to authorize any additional
disbursements

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
disbursements
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.029 align:start position:0%
disbursements
um

00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
as far as your your second
 
00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.909 align:start position:0%
as far as your your second
question

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
des is the entity that permits these
 
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.669 align:start position:0%
des is the entity that permits these
landfills

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
we we don't have funds to maintain and
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
monitor landfills
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
we operate under the statutes and rules
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
that are in existence and we we can do
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
what's allowed in the statutes and rules
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we've been working really hard in
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
close communication with econ to try to
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
find options under the statutes and
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
rules but we are limited
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
represent petri
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
is there any place in the in the
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
law to waiver some of these fees
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
or this uh
 
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.430 align:start position:0%
or this uh
trust

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
some of you know the what we're trying
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
to do here
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
to waive the requirement for financial
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
issues right well it's it seems so
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
there's some ambiguity as to what was
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
interpreted and uh
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's going to be a
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
des the rules that des operates under
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
usually include waiver provisions
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the provisions usually say that
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
there needs to be an equivalent
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
option presented
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
so if we could find that
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
that that may be something that could be
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
looked into
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for des
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
okay sarah don't go too far no problem
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
um since this is a work session we
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
basically are

questions on the uh
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could do that first have
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
you looked at the amendment yet oh yeah
 
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.630 align:start position:0%

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
i was asked to put the amendment in by
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
i was asked to put the amendment in by
econ

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
econ
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
econ

and i would like to have
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
mr pickens talk about that because he's
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
the expert on it but this was a request
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
from econ to put in that amendment okay
 
00:36:05.839 --> 00:36:06.630 align:start position:0%
from econ to put in that amendment okay
okay

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.190 align:start position:0%
that's fine
so

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
please mr pickett
 
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.630 align:start position:0%
please mr pickett
so

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
first foremost thank you again for uh
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
having us here today
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
certainly myself and on behalf of econ
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
and newport citizens we appreciate your
 
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.589 align:start position:0%
and newport citizens we appreciate your
consideration

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i can assure you in hearing a few of
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
the questions that came forth um
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
when when uh sarah was presenting
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know we would not be here unless we
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
had to so we are all volunteers most of
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
us are either business folks or owned
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in town and we have looked at
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
every possibility that we can in order
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
to meet the financial assurance so this
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
is certainly not the number one
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
option we had this is the oh my goodness
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't at least look at this option
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
we may have to fold up shop and
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
that landfill may go into the hands of
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
the state of which the wonderful
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of newport would have to our
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
newport as well as the state would have
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for anyway so again what we are
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we are trying to
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
continue on with our steward or being
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
steward of that landfill to take that
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
off from the onus of the state to ensure
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
that it continually is maintained
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the fashion that has been maintained
 
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.790 align:start position:0%
in the fashion that has been maintained
so

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is definitely a fishbowl
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
one said something about stakeholders we
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
have talked with every stakeholder we
 
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
have talked with every stakeholder we
can

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting in newport that
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
included all of our delegates it
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
included the state it included the
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
it included the
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
joe kenny councillor kenny it included
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
the town it included a number of folks
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
so again this is not something that we
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
have not looked at all possible
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities for us to basically
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
look for a solution for this and it was
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
truly at that meeting when we vetted all
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
of our options that we met with you know
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
senator ward representative
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
rollins as well as um
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
councilman kenny and they said look they
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
spun the situation and based upon the
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
midstream change in what happened with a
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
state organization i think we need to go
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the legislature so again this was not
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
me saying oh my god we've got to hit a
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
pot of money this is our representatives
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
that basically said this is exactly what
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're here for so that is why this bill
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
is here the first bill was basically a
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
placeholder because we did not have the
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
time and energy that we now have had to
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
work with experts so we are working
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
closely with des and when
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
sarah indicates that's the case they
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
have been but their hands are tied they
 
00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:49.829 align:start position:0%
have been but their hands are tied they
have

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
regulations and and laws in place that
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
just makes it very difficult for them to
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
do anything to help us in them out
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
we are also working with nobus
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
engineering so novus is probably one of
 
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.829 align:start position:0%
engineering so novus is probably one of
the

00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
premier engineers in the state and novus
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
has been on this job since we took it on
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
back in
2006.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
and then we are also working with
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
council because i am not familiar how to
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
sort of work
 
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
sort of work
this

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
scenario so we are working with um a
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman who is an environmental
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
attorney expert and actually used to sit
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
as a head of
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's team for the des
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
so again we are working with everyone
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
and anyone and the partners that we
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to work with to figure
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
this out and that's why we're here
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
everything pointed to you gotta at least
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
give this a shot because it fits the
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
criteria that we believe
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
might look for consideration
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
so the amendment was put forth after
 
00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:54.870 align:start position:0%
so the amendment was put forth after
having

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
further discussions with all partners
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
because we had some time in order to put
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
that revision together
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
and that is basically the culmination of
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
the way that all of those parties um
 
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.069 align:start position:0%
the way that all of those parties um
believe

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
that this could best work so
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
and and again whenever you want me to
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
stop and answer questions i'm happy to
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
but there's just a signifi there's a lot
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
of information that that i wish i was
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
here earlier and unfortunately i was
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
literally sitting outside and thought
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
you were on the first agenda item
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
um so i only caught the last but the
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
actual amount in the trust is not 883.
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
so as of the december 1st 2021 statement
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
from citizens bank where the trust is it
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
is seven hundred and fifty six thousand
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh six yeah seven hundred fifty six
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred forty nine dollars
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
however that's overstated because we
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
have bills outstanding for five years
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
from the town that has been supporting
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
our efforts without being able to get
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
the money to pay them
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
they basically withheld five years of
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
invoices because we were not able to get
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
that money released by the des so the
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
town understanding the importance of the
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
landfill basically
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
gave us an invoice of 172
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
699 so that money is already spent that
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
is the work that the town did over the
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
last five years to meet all of the
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
criteria necessary from des
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
so we have not been able to pay the town
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
because we cannot provide the financial
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
assurance to allow the des to have us
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
take money out of that account to pay
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the town so at this point in town the
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
town said you know we feel we have done
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
what we can we have done this for five
 
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
what we can we have done this for five
years

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we also have to collect this for the
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of newport we are no longer
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do this gratis until
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
you figure out what is going on and
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
again that is what's pushing a lot of
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
this resolution is because we right now
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
do not have the monies to pay for the
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance of a landfill
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
so if you were to take out the 173 000
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the monies that's in the trust that
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically leaves us with 584 000
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
so that is the monies that are in the
 
00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
so that is the monies that are in the
trust

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then we have been working with
 
00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:12.550 align:start position:0%
and then we have been working with
nobis

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
nobis
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
very diligently um
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
on what the annual cost of that landfill
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
will be so i didn't want to come here
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
without numbers and have you opine over
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
something without knowing exactly what
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
that we would need in order to support
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
and meet that financial assurance
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
so if we were to take a look at all of
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
the annual costs associated as well as
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
take a piece apart of the capital costs
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
that we would have to do over the next
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
30 years we basically would need 820 000
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
and and before i start des has not seen
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
these numbers so just to put that forth
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
we just finalized these yesterday after
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
a very long meeting to make sure we
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
brought it to you folks um so 820 000
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
of that eight hundred and twenty
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
thousand there is a ten percent
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
contingency so that is built in for
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
future years should interest rates go
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
awry or sure or or should inflation or
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
interest assumptions
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
sort of not be exactly what we're
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that will sort of absorb some
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the question so we need 820 000 we
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
now have 534 so there is no way at this
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
point in time that we are going to get
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
the okay
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
from des to allow us to use any of that
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
money to continue managing that landfill
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
so what we are looking for because of
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
that midstream change or as they call it
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
a clarification
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
um regardless it has put us in this
 
00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:37.109 align:start position:0%
um regardless it has put us in this
position

00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know we are unable
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
to provide support
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
in order to manage and monitor that for
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
the folks in newport the folks of the
 
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
the folks in newport the folks of the
state

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
the monies are just not there
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
so if we were successful and if you
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
folks were to consider this to a
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit and i'm not sure someone had
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
said something about precedent that is a
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
great question and the first one that i
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
would ask and the first one i thought
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
someone would ask before i stepped in
 
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.950 align:start position:0%
someone would ask before i stepped in
here

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know if there is ever any other
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
non-profit that took on for the benefit
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
of a town the ownership of a landfill
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
without ever earning one dollar on that
 
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.390 align:start position:0%
without ever earning one dollar on that
landfill

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
and if indeed rules were changed such
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
that they had enough prior to but when
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
the rule changed they did not any longer
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
have it i would say that's a good
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
precedent and if there was another
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
organization that was doing that that
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
got into this situation i would hope you
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
would also consider that so this is not
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
a precedent for the 50 landfills this is
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
a precedent for a very very unique
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
situation that i have not had the chance
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
to speak to anyone professional or not
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
that has ever seen this happen before
 
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
that has ever seen this happen before
never

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.069 align:start position:0%
never
um

00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
so if we were to put that 500 000 where
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
that to come to us
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
um that 500 000 would basically go
 
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.069 align:start position:0%
um that 500 000 would basically go
towards

00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.109 align:start position:0%
towards
the

00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
requirement of financial assurance
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and then also as you know
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
we pretty much not only need the
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
financial assurance but we need the
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
money to actually pay for
 
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
money to actually pay for
the

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.150 align:start position:0%
the
expenses

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
so this is again a one-up we are the
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
only organization that is having to use
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
820 000 that we just have to amass as a
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
non-profit and sit aside and never use
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
it you know i do not know any
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
organization nonprofit or not that has
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
that requirement unless it's restricted
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
but it's usually restricted for a
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
general purpose at some point a capital
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
needs project or something
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
so the onus on us as a one up is to come
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
up with 820 000 that we just kindly
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
leave in there into perpetuity
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
and we have to also come up with the
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
expense so remember this is only taking
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
care of the financial assurance so with
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
that 500 000 we still have some left
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
over from that financial assurance
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
package that the des is only going to be
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
looking for the amount we need for
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
financial assurance and then we will be
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
able to cover the expenses with the
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
amount that we have left over
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
but even in that particular case you
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
know we will have 464 000 as an
 
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.589 align:start position:0%
know we will have 464 000 as an
organization

00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:14.550 align:start position:0%
organization
to

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.430 align:start position:0%
to
go

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
through other means to try to find that
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
400 000
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
and again we just need to get the
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
financial assurance piece done first
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
in order to meet the legislative
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
requirements to at least be able to pay
 
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.109 align:start position:0%
requirements to at least be able to pay
anything

00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
um so that's a situation we're in i
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
apologize i know you said but i just
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that's okay
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
can i ask you you said
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
as you were making your presentation
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
that this was the only non-profit that
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
you were aware of that did some that
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
undertook something like this for the
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
benefit of the town and so i guess my
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
question is if you did this for the
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
benefit of the town
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
and you're now
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know short on money
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't it be the town
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
who was the beneficiary that that is
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
coming up with the money as opposed to
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
so the town manager actually sits on
 
00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:18.390 align:start position:0%
so the town manager actually sits on
econ

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
econ
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
and he used to be the president of the
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
organization and because all of this
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
basically came to a head he stepped down
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.990 align:start position:0%
basically came to a head he stepped down
so

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
i am relatively new to the presidency
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
since june when all of this basically
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
took place
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
because of a significant conflict of
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
interest exactly based upon some of
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
those things that you are indicating so
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
when i ask him that exact same question
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
he says look mark we're only one of 27
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
towns that put trash in that landfill
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful for us to be able to
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
support you but we are not going to
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
cover the expense for 26 other towns
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
trash who put originally a million one
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
in there to cover 30 years the 27
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
districts did exactly what they were
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
asked at that time by the des and by
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
everyone that negotiated there was 1.1
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars put in there to cover it
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then the 27 towns basically said
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that and we're also
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to give you an extra 200 000
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
just in case you had to cover any
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
remedial cost for a significant spill or
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
anything that's unexpected so you're
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
getting 1.3 million dollars in order to
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
do that
so

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is an inexpenses change we've done
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the law the regulation the
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
agreement with the exception of a change
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
in clarification in 2014 that said nope
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's not 30 anymore now you have to have
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
a rolling 30.
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
trust me it's an ask but again you have
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
to go back to the town and have the town
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
take on a liability or the town do
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
something on behalf of 27 other towns
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
when they sign that indemnification
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
agreement like every other town in that
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
um group
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
you ought to follow up then um so if i'm
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
understanding and and please understand
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
sir i'm in in any way faulting you you
 
00:49:11.839 --> 00:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
sir i'm in in any way faulting you you
know

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
in some personal way or the board or
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
anything like that but i guess as i'm
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
as i'm trying to understand this
 
00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
as i'm trying to understand this
if

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that the the
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
towns that were involved in this
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
had not been under
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
what des says was a was a
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know a misunderstanding as to what
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
their requirements were and that and and
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
that may have been reasonable or unreal
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
making any judgment on that but let's
 
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
making any judgment on that but let's
say

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
that the towns had correctly understood
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
that they needed to have a 30-year
 
00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
that they needed to have a 30-year
rolling

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
assurance as opposed to 30 years fixed
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like what that would
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
have meant is
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the towns all would have had to
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
would have had to would have known at
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
the beginning and would have had to put
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
up more money
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
so in a sense
 
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
so in a sense
they've

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
they've
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
they've put up
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
they've gotten the benefit if you will
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
of putting up less money in the
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
beginning because they were under this
 
00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
beginning because they were under this
misapprehension

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
misapprehension
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so again i come back to my question
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
if that's true if they got the benefits
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
so to speak of putting up less money so
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
presumably all those 27 towns had that
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
excess money to spend on something else
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
and now you know
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
now it's come time to pay the piper so
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't it be those towns
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
that have to put up the extra money as
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to the state
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that is a great point and one that i
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
would love nothing more to go to the
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
towns and just have them open up their
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
coffers and say mark regardless of
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
anything that we signed way back when we
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
feel for your position and we are just
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
going to cover your expenses until
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
perpetuity at whatever expenses they
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
um and i don't mean to be facetious but
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
if indeed they knew it was a rolling 30
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
every single time that we would have to
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
present this to the des in a three-year
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
period for the next 30 years it wouldn't
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
have been written as a one-time amount
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and there certainly
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an indemnification agreement
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is subject to change in rules
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
subject to change in regulation and
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't come to us if expenses go up so
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have been the negotiating
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
piece for us
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
it would have been every three years if
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
these expenses go up we are going to do
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
financial assurance for the next 30 and
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
if we don't have enough we are going to
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
divvy it up amongst all you towns that
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
is exactly the way it would have been
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
written if they would have known or we
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
would have known it was a rolling 30 and
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
not a fixed 30. so if we were to go back
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how it should have been
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
done but you only have the information
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
all this was signed off by the
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner at that point in time i
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
mean the commissioner is the one that
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
was releasing the funds from the trust
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
and in his letters he basically said you
 
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.349 align:start position:0%
and in his letters he basically said you
know

00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
i as a commissioner allow you to take
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
this out because there's enough to cover
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
the remaining 15 years of this agreement
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i i it's not unclear it is no way
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
um i i know they say it's a
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
clarification it was not unclear not
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
unclear at all i can show you all of
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
those letters where they say you're good
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
to go for the remaining and all of a
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
sudden you know the next one comes in
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
and says just kidding you know now we
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
need 30. so
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that occurred in 2016 is that
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
correct the actual law change i think
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
was 20. that wasn't a question when did
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
they stop allowing you to we were unable
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
to provide financial assurance in 16.
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay so that was correct
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
so the last five years again that's the
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
five years that the town has been
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
covering our expenses
 
00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
covering our expenses
um

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
awaiting hopefully
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
a resolution
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
and again we we've tried and had
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
discussions with the des
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i do believe their hands are tied
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
because their regulation says you need a
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
rolling 30-year financial assurance and
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
trust me i think they are willing and i
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't mean to speak on behalf i think
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
they would be willing to do anything
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable within their control i mean
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
i mean they really really do not want to
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
take this landfill back and that's right
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner's mouth
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.030 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
no i there was just one other thing that
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to add is that the state
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
operates on a two-year budget and this
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
is the off year
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
and generally when we get special
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
we get special bills like this we when
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
we usually don't fund them in this in
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
the second year until we come around and
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
put another budget together
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
so a couple things on that
 
00:53:57.599 --> 00:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
so a couple things on that
um

00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
the premise of us ever having to use the
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
state's money
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
is nearly
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
statistically nil right because the
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
monies that are in that account
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
can never be used and the des controls
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
it and the des will not allow us and i
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
can assure you that over the last five
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
years they're pretty good at that will
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
not allow us to take money out if we
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough to preserve that
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
financial assurance which is the state's
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
money so the way that we look at it it
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
is a placeholder
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
in order for us to meet financial
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
assurance but monies that we're never
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
so the only way that we ever use that
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
money is if we can't afford the annual
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
expenses and the state takes it back but
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is
 
00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:44.950 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is
if

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
there is any well first of all the good
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
news if this closes and sarah indicated
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
a number of these closed so if this
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
closes within the next 15 years i mean
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is probably one of the strongest
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
and best managed maintained line
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
so if it does reach a closure 500 000
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
goes right back to the state
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
so the monies are being expended um
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i know that doesn't answer your
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
question but i guess
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
the timing isn't as critical if we knew
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
it was coming
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
and that could be one of the
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations with des right so they they
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't need it today
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to speak on behalf of
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
the des and sarah can certainly come up
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
and indicate if if i'm indicating
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that we need it today
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
we just need to show that we're going to
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
so even if it was to come in at another
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
period of time you know that is
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
something that we would go back to the
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
des and say you know pretty much
 
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.870 align:start position:0%
des and say you know pretty much
guarantee

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
as far as guarantees can go so but we
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
would prefer it because it it's cleaner
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
but if that is an impossibility
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know we could probably work around
 
00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
you know we could probably work around
timing

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
represent heath
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
very confusing
 
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
very confusing
um

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
how do you raise the funds for the
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
yearly maintenance right now you already
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
owe newport for five years
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
so number one how are you going to get
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
that money
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
how are you going to continue to pay for
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
the maintenance
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
now you're asking for this 500 000
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
another question is what's your
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
succession plan i mean you have this
 
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
succession plan i mean you have this
board

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
are you going to be there forever
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
i just this is a problem with lots of
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that just
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
bothers me greatly great question and
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
the first one i can answer a lot easier
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
than the second because i can only speak
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
for myself being on there and i don't
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
foresee myself i mean i've been on there
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
for 20 years and if i was to give you
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the membership if anyone was
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
going to jump they would have jumped
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
over the last six months right because
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
right now we spend 100 of our time
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
having nothing to do with economic
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
development in town all having to do
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
with run in ash landfill so if anyone
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
was going to jump i assure you
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
even me we would have jumped and we
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
would have handed the keys over to des
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
because that's the easy answer right
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's the real easy answer as a
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer is why am i going to spend 40
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
hours a week doing something
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
that takes me away from my day job so i
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
think folks will definitely be around
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
but i cannot guarantee the organization
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
has been in existence since the early
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
90s too thick and thin
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
and many of us are still there so i can
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
all i can give you
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
is as much comfort level as that gives
 
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
is as much comfort level as that gives
you

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
the second one with the numbers so the
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
way that the numbers pan out
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
account

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
if we were to get
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
another half a million
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
we would have appropriate financial
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
assurance to take monies in order to pay
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
the town 172. so after we take
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
the monies that we have now
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
minus the 172
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
plus the 500
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
that would at the end of the day
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
leave us with about 464
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
000 in our coffers while still having
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
financial assurance at 8 20
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
expenses and the way that the expenses
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
work is the annual expenses only run
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
around i mean the annual testing
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
expenses only run around 17 or 18 000 a
 
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.950 align:start position:0%
expenses only run around 17 or 18 000 a
year

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
where the other expenses come in is more
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
capital replacement so we have to
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
replace a leak j tank at 50 grand or we
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
have to replace those are not going to
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
happen every year and those aren't even
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
going to happen within probably the next
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.549 align:start position:0%
10 years
so

00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
that 464 000
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
basically over 30 years
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
provides enough monies for us to cover
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
those expenses and we would reserve that
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
ear market keep it and then the other
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing we've been able to do and again
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking at every possibility so
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
also on that property is a garage so we
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
have negotiated with the town of newport
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
to rent the garage for some of their
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
equipment for 5 000 a year and then the
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
shooting range in which they used to
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
train their
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
staff and that as well would give a five
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar annual so we have
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
recurring revenue of ten thousand on top
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
of that twenty six thousand which over
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
time we are just hopeful we would always
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
have enough to cover um those definitely
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
annual expenses
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
but the capital expenses as well at
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
least that gets us i hope 15 20 years
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
and that's a long time for us to figure
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
out additional income in order to keep
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
this going right now we don't have time
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we're right now under the gun of
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
the des with 90 days to come up with
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
financial assurance not 15 years
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative murray you had a question
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative petry
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh where does that 26 000 where does
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
that come from
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
your revenue
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
so it would come from the excess monies
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we would have when we take the
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
amount that we currently have in the
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
financial assurance plus the half a
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
million were we to be
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
where we to get your consideration
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
we only need to keep 820 in that account
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
so if you basically take the total
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
amount we have now less than 120 that is
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of monies that we would have
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
in our own coffers to cover the expense
 
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
in our own coffers to cover the expense
uh

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're spending at least 17 plus
 
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.349 align:start position:0%
you're spending at least 17 plus
incidentals

01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
incidentals
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
you you don't have in other words you're
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
not keeping to build that
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
or maintain your uh your expenses what
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
where's that com where's that excess
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
again i have a spreadsheet but i don't
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
want to bore you with the numbers
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
because we also haven't um shared these
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
with the with with the des so we have
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i'm not explaining
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
explaining this well so we have two
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
different components right we have the
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
financial assurance which is 820 000.
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have minus the 172 000 due to the
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
town in newport we have 584 thousand
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
so that's the monies we have now
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
the other part a piece of piece of this
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is where the numbers
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
don't add up for you folks
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
understandably is we have that
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
additional 200 000 that we have never
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
spent so we have 200 000 that was also
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
that we took over the landfill so we
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
have that two hundred thousand so right
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
now we have seventy we have seven
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty four thousand dollars
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
to basically cover
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
820 for the financial assurance and then
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
presumably 820 for 30 years
 
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.950 align:start position:0%
presumably 820 for 30 years
so

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
if we were to get the half a million
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
dollars on top of the 784
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
again that is what would allow us the
 
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
again that is what would allow us the
monies

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
monies
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the financial assurance
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
we needed to cover those expenses for a
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
significant period of time which will be
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
at least half of it or close to half of
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
it on an annual basis will come from
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
recurring revenue from the town's rental
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.430 align:start position:0%
follow
so

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
so you're getting a revenue of 10 10 000
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
possibly so the 26 is what
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's not every year
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
that you have a revenue of 26.
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
no not a revenue but we would
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
deplete from the reserve that we have
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
based upon taking all those monies
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
together and having some excess over and
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
above the financial assurance
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we can't use we will still have
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
a bucket of monies that we will
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
deplete over time in order to cover
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
those expenses
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
until we figure out how to not only get
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
10 000 but we figure out a stream of
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
income or an income source to get us the
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
full amount right now is that 200 000 is
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that liquid
 
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
that liquid
yes

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
so okay so you do have yes you do have
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
backup so we we put that basically in a
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
reserve account the day that we um did
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
this deal and it's still sitting in that
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
account because that was part of that
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
indemnification that we needed that 200
 
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.670 align:start position:0%
indemnification that we needed that 200
000

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
um but again we are hopeful and we have
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
not spoken with the des so i'm somewhat
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
hesitant but there is no restrictions
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we can't use that 200 000 towards
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
the financial assurance piece so if it's
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
sitting there not being used anyway it
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have it sitting there
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
and not being used anyway but help to go
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
towards the financial assurance thank
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
you thank you
representative

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr pitkin
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh a few questions the first one
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i i think you weren't i think you
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
said you weren't the president at the
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
time so you may not know the answer to
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
this this is more of a philosophical one
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
and then i have some numerical ones for
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
you but
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
by this non-profit to take over a
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
landfill the numbers we heard were it's
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
the only one out of 400 in the state
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
what was the thought process behind
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
the landfill was closed and there was 27
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
towns that were trying to manage this
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
one particular piece
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
and from what i'm told it was just a
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
logistical and administrative nightmare
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the solutions was always
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
to open up the remaining two cells so
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's a four-cell ash landfill only two
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
cells were used by opening up those two
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
cells i was also told
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we would get incinerated ash not
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
just from folks in new hampshire but we
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be pulling in incinerated ash from
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
all over new england so literally
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
newport would have become the trash town
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
so we would have had trash trucks
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
coming in daily and again just
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
everything else that goes along with
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
that type of operation
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
so at that point in time the president
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
of econ also happened to be the town
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
manager so again you can see where
 
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
manager so again you can see where
conflicts

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
but it really wasn't a conflict because
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
we worked so close together but it was
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
at that point in time when they all
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated and said okay
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
how can we do this to preserve that from
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
never being open again
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
to have it go under a conservation
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
easement for the benefit
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
and it's right on the claremont line so
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
i would say claremont as well
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
but for the benefit of newport while
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that econ collects enough
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
money so it is not harmed financially
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
over that 30-year period
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
so minds i guess much greater than mine
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
got together and there were attorneys
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
that and that were on
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
both sides so they come up with this
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
plan that was supported by the selectmen
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
in order to preserve newport as not
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
being the dump town the land is now in
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
conservation based upon that process and
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
then they worked with the des because we
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
are the again we are the first
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit not only to do it we are the
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
first one that ever received a modified
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
permit for a closure as being someone
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
that is not affiliated with
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
the refuge business to manage so again
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
we had to go through significant
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
hoops i believe at that point in time
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
because this was something new for the
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
des they said oh my god but again it was
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
proven to the des that this
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
process and the support
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism of that monies would make it
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
plausible so if you were to ask me would
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
i do that today absolutely not i mean
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm a banker i understand liability
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
issues i understand hazardous materials
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
right we stay away from them
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
but i can't speak for you know the board
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
at that time or at least those that put
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
it together
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that at the time it
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a very good solution to a
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the 90-day period that the
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
des has given you when does that expire
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
um we're getting calls daily and again
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
right thankfully maybe over the last
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
couple days so i think it might have
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.319 --> 01:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
i i think it's probably expired expired
 
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.190 align:start position:0%
i i think it's probably expired expired
already

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.109 align:start position:0%
already
um

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
possibilities if you couldn't come up
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
in your opinion what
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
first of all i guess what would happen
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
if your numbers uh you can't meet your
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
numbers what do you
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
presume what will happen and when and
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the second part of that is the money
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's currently
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
held whatever we've gone over a bunch of
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
numbers whatever numbers remain what
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
would happen to that
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
so this is what i'm told and again i
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't mean to speak on their behalf but
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
again i've been part and parcel of
 
01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:35.590 align:start position:0%
again i've been part and parcel of
conversations

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
so the monies and financial assurance
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
are basically there to cover the expense
 
01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.030 align:start position:0%
are basically there to cover the expense
should

01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
one of these individuals that operate
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
these become insolvent and then it goes
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
back to the state and then the state
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
presumably has that security
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
in order to continue to manage it in the
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
manner and fashion that it was
 
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.910 align:start position:0%
manner and fashion that it was
so

01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
any monies that we have
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
trust fund would go back to the state
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
so the other alternative now is the
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
state could definitely take that back
 
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
state could definitely take that back
with

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
584 000 after paying the town
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
but again there's resources involved i
 
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
but again there's resources involved i
mean

01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
i understand they find it's less
 
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.510 align:start position:0%
i understand they find it's less
cheaper

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
and much more efficient for us to
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
operate it than if they operated it i
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
believe totally understand and
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh the answer
 
01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.749 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh the answer
um

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
i think i had one more you mentioned
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh i guess this isn't a conservation
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
easement now yes
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably silly i guess i
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
was a conservation group i probably
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to touch it with a 10 foot
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
pole but has any conservation groups
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
been approached on this
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
so the only piece that's in conservation
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the actual landfill itself so we have
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
approximately another eight acres that
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to be in that conservation
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
area or the area surrounding
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
the landfill that is not required again
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be monitored and managed and that is
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
held by the town so the only one
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
presumably that was yeah the town is
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
part of that holds the conservation so
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's eight acres it's not in it and
 
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
there's eight acres it's not in it and
then

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
what's the acreage of the
 
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.149 align:start position:0%
what's the acreage of the
total

01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
total
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
just curious not important sadly enough
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know i know the eight acres
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
because again that was one of the
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
options try to rent it try to lease it
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
try to sell it or even have the des take
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
a mortgage on it i mean we've tried
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
everything we can
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
but again if it's not liquid it's very
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to um
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
if it's not liquid or if it's not able
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
to be raised
 
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.430 align:start position:0%
to be raised
through

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
through tax
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
tax assessment means i would say maybe
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's an additional
 
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.149 align:start position:0%
it's an additional
six

01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
we get a chance to speak with sarah
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
we get a chance to speak with sarah
again

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
and this is maybe in some sense it's a
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question but i but i think
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
your input would be important if
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
as you said before if if you have if if
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
you have evidence that in in you know in
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
the past before there was this
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
clarification des had basically said you
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
know you can
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
you can spend the money that you've
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
proposed to spend and whether because
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
you have enough
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
you have enough to you know to guarantee
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
this for 15 years
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it be an appropriate
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
resolution of this matter
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.830 align:start position:0%
for that
for

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
its sort of reinterpretation why isn't
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
an appropriate resolution for that for
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
your group to say to des look
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
we relied on you
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
and now we don't have we don't have a
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of money
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's your problem you're going to have
 
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
that's your problem you're going to have
to

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
you you're going to have to take the
 
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
you you're going to have to take the
risk

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
of having a
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
less of a bond if you will
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
to guarantee the assurance of this
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
than you might prefer
 
01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.189 align:start position:0%
than you might prefer
but

01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the way it is and we're
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
not you know
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
i mean why wouldn't why wouldn't that as
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to the state appropriating 500
 
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
opposed to the state appropriating 500
000

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate resolution
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
so i was i was basically told
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
i believe and again sarah can absolutely
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
positively um give her opinion on this
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
so a couple things happened if indeed
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
the requirement was still only 15 years
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we could use the monies in order to
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
cover the expenses for 15 years that
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
might be a viable solution not one that
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
they would probably accept but for us a
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
viable solution but now what happens is
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
we not only have to have
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the monies for 15 years but we have to
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
be able to pay for them extraneous to
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that amount so even if we did that
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
they'd say or potentially could say fine
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
leave the 15 years in there but now you
 
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
still have to pay for it for the next
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
30. so we still don't have the ongoing
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
operation expenses because they still
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
won't allow us to touch that even if
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
they say that amounts enough however i
 
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.229 align:start position:0%
they say that amounts enough however i
believe

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
that in order and again i'm speaking out
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
of turn but you wanted my opinion it's
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
in order for them
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
to circumvent
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
the actual regulation it would require
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of carve out from a body
 
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.270 align:start position:0%
some sort of carve out from a body
that

01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
is supported by you folks so like a
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
legislative carve out that said we know
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
you require 30. we know that's the law
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
but we are going to allow a carve out
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
for our econ and again i am speaking
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
well out of turn
 
01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
well out of turn
um

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i think sarah said
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately that they have a
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
regulation and again they say we are
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
sorry we're so sorry but you know we
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
have looked at everything we can do and
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
when we got the letter of administrative
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
order um it just basically said our
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
hands are tied you have to come up with
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
a 30 year
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question i i think
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
we would be willing to work with
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it solves the problem
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
of going forward and actually being able
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for those expenses
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that would solve for the 15-year
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
financial assurance but we still would
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the expenses annually
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
so can i just am i understanding then
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
you were paying
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
for sort of ongoing expenses out of the
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
original monies that were put up is that
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
correct and that with with with
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
the at least tacit approval of des at
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
least up until 2016. yes that's correct
 
01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.630 align:start position:0%
least up until 2016. yes that's correct
so

01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
the monies that paid were what was
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
approved by the commissioner to take out
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
of that financial assurance trust fund
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
to pay the ongoing expenses
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then we were told we can't do that
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
anymore so not only do we need more on
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the financial insurance side but now we
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
have to cover the expenses so again it
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
is a double whammy it wasn't just a
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
single whammy
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
it was a double whammy where we have to
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
come up now with you know over a million
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in total whereas before we
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
didn't need anything
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you now i have two questions
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think ms kearns made a comment that a
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
new analysis is being done
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
um if you can speak to that is that
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
possibly that's going to be an
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
optimistic analysis from your point of
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
view and secondly is there a way of
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
having a discussion that perhaps this is
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
working the way it's supposed to as i
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
understand trust and endowments
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's still frustrating to me in some
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
situations where so much money is tied
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
up that can't be used
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that this is maybe a situation where
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
this fund is being used appropriately um
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think to representative lin's point
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
that yes you don't have this and
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of misunderstanding or rules
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
change whatever now it's an appropriate
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
um use of this money um can you sort of
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
speak to that as a potential argument
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you sure again great questions i
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
we indeed are working on an analysis and
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what we
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
finished up yesterday
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
so as i said everyone has been
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
supportive and stakeholders we've gone
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
to nobis nova nobis has given us and i
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
probably should be announcing this but a
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
significant discount
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
on what they're doing for us because
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
they understand our plight they don't
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
have to they just truly truly want to do
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
what they can so they do our annual
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
testing our monitoring and our reporting
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that makes us feel good because the
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
state always tells us again that the
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
process and the monitoring and the
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
managing is one of the best so they have
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
no issue with what we do or how we do it
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not nobis so they have cut
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
down their expenses there were a lot of
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
things where they were subcontracting
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
out a number of things that we pay them
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
to do so what they did was they put us
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
in contact with the actual contractors
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
so now that we are able to contract with
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
those folks that literally go and take
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
the testing and so on and so forth so we
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
saved a significant amount on that end
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
as well i've spoken to the uh the folks
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
that uh transport the leachate they're
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
helping us out and even the guy that
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
does the mowing so trust me i've gone to
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
them and i said we've got to get this
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thing down to as thin a margin as
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
possible because that's what determines
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
that financial assurance amount is you
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
take the annual amount you multiply it
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
times 30. so that has been basically cut
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
down um to its bare bones the one piece
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
that is very difficult to cut down is
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the part or piece that you
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
really can't cut down the cost of
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
of replacing a leachate tank is 50 000
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
no matter how you look at it the cost of
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
replacing a monitoring well is three
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
thousand no matter how you look at it so
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is those capital expenses that we
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
always have to make sure that we have
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
enough to cover
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
those are the parts or pieces that sort
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
of contribute a significant amount to
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
that financial assurance pot so
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
this 820 that we're working on again a
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
10 contingency so without the
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
contingency you know we basically would
 
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.030 align:start position:0%
contingency you know we basically would
need

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.870 align:start position:0%
need
approximately

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
760 000 without the contingency
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
something and maybe i shouldn't uh
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
rephrase it had something to do possibly
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
this mechanism is working as it's
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to work in that you can't
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
fulfill the obligations regardless of
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the reason behind it and that this money
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know in the trust fund has been set
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
aside for this type of the situation and
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
that this is actually working
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately and des should be using
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
this money because regardless of the
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
situation you can't fulfill your
 
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
situation you can't fulfill your
obligations

01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'd love to have all you guys in my
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
discussions with the des so um
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
again i think where where their hands
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
are tied is that the regulation
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
specifically states regardless that they
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
need a financial assurance for
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
30 years and if they are to make a
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
departure someone had said something
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
about precedent that may set one of the
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
biggest precedents is if you are making
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
a departure from the des rules
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happened prior to
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
and then someone else comes in and says
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
wait a minute you made us put an extra
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
amount or to cover an extra amount so
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
again sarah is a person to answer that
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
but i would say that that makes
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
that would work
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
um you know to that point i understand
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
what you're saying around thank you
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
around you know the 30 years and their
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
regulations but if you just locked your
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
doors and said we're done
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
then this money that's in the trust fund
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
is what des would have to use in order
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
to continue the work oh that's the
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
option and they know that that's a a
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
viable option and again if i didn't have
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
the passion to do what i'm doing here
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know who else on that
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
group would literally say i'm going to
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
leave my job for hours on end and talk
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
to everyone possible to get this thing
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
fixed again this is saving the state
 
01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
fixed again this is saving the state
taxpayers

01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.189 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
well

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the same amount of money but we're
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
taking on the work and and and so this
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
a different
 
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.870 align:start position:0%
a different
way

01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
to get to the same result that may be a
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
better way if we're if we're thinking
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
about taxpayers money which i know
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's your job and i appreciate that
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely right i mean and
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
again it's unfortunately not a threat
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
because none of us
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
are able to with day jobs run in ash
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
landfill and go out and try to figure
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
out somehow some way a mechanism
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
to create an income stream to maintain a
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
national landfill when we're an economic
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
development organization we want to go
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
out we want to improve newport and
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
sullivan county i mean that is our
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
mission our mission nowhere says you
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
know we will maintain an ash landfill
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
but you are absolutely right that that
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay a few times sarah could you uh
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually mr picken it might be helpful
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you could sit up here at this chair
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
of course if uh and that way and i
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
very congenial
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
but i think their hands are tied
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh somebody had
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte did you have
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay so representative lin will bail you
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
out okay
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
miss kern i wonder if i could ask you
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
i understand what the you know what the
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
regulations say and i'm you know i
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
assume you've interpreted them correctly
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and all of that but
 
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
and all of that but
isn't

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:20.550 align:start position:0%
isn't
doesn't

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't
des

01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
ex exercise in this situation just like
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't in a whole bunch of other
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
you have to in other words
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
you don't the law doesn't say you will
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
take it over or i mean this isn't don't
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
you have sort of for lack of a better
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
term prosecutorial discretion to decide
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
well sure we could take over this
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
landfill because there's not enough of a
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
bond so to speak but
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to decide in the exercise of
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
our discretion
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
not to do so just like you know in a
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
criminal case there may somebody may
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
have committed a burglary but the county
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
attorney doesn't have to or the attorney
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
general doesn't have to prosecute they
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
can say we've decided for other reasons
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.310 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
des

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
does have
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
and what des needs to do is
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
weigh many factors
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
including the
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
liability that is presented for future
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
generations when a landfill does not
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
have proper financial assurance
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
i asked my staff you know 400 closed
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
landfills um if
 
01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:39.350 align:start position:0%
landfills um if
if

01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
many of them did not have enough
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
financial assurance and
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
they they all
 
01:23:46.239 --> 01:23:47.750 align:start position:0%
they they all
their

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
became insolvent
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
what would that burden be and it's it's
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars on the
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
state so so we need to keep that in mind
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
sure i understand but if i'm
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
understanding i'm sorry can i have it if
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding correctly there there
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
isn't as far as we know
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
there isn't another situation like this
 
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.830 align:start position:0%
there isn't another situation like this
and

01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
it appears and you correct me if i'm
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
wrong it appears that
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
operators of the of the this landfill in
 
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
operators of the of the this landfill in
question

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
again correct me if i'm wrong but
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's no claim that they operated in
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
bad faith or that they took you know
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that somebody took some of the money and
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
went to aruba or anything like that as
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
far as we know they've done
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
they've done what they're supposed to
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear that that econ has
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
been very good stewards of the
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
environment with this landfill right so
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i mean in those circum wouldn't that
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
be a pretty good reason to say you know
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
of all the landfills that and all the
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
operators of landfills in the state
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
that we might you know
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
we might want to go after
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is probably
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
not the one we want to do at for and
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
even though we don't have
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
as much of a
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
security as we'd like
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
they seem to be doing what they're
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know if if we take it over we're
 
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.229 align:start position:0%
you know if if we take it over we're
gonna

01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to pay the money to
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's not there in case something does
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
go wrong
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
so far it hasn't gone wrong so why not
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know why not why not not try to fix
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
a problem that's not broken at least not
 
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.430 align:start position:0%
a problem that's not broken at least not
now

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
we we absolutely
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely don't want to take over this
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
landfill call financial assurance on the
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
landfill that's why we're working with
 
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.950 align:start position:0%
landfill that's why we're working with
econ

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
econ
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
your question may get at
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the problem
 
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.669 align:start position:0%
the the problem
that

01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
there needs to be money for annual
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring as well as
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
the financial assurance
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
we can't we're our hands are tied as far
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
as the rules and regulations go we can't
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
authorize more disbursements from the
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
um from the trust fund
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that's how we find ourselves in this
 
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
and that's how we find ourselves in this
situation

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
situation
you

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
are you ready now
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i am ready okay good
 
01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:19.910 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i am ready okay good
um

01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
is the des prepared to take this over if
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
if des needed to we
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
we have experience with another landfill
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the state calling financial assurance
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
on the landfill
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
that other landfill has
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
nearly spent down its financial
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
assurance account to zero so in coming
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
years we will be needing to figure out
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
how to fund additional maintenance and
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring at that landfill
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
but we have experience doing that sort
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
you do okay um
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
the 2014 rule change what was the
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
impetus behind that
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
well i was in a different part of des
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
moines you might be but i thought you
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
might know the answer
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh that rule change
 
01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh that rule change
included

01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
this provision about financial assurance
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying it as well as some other
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.550 align:start position:0%
clarifying it as well as some other
things

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is the reason the
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
30-year rolling requirement was
 
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
30-year rolling requirement was
clarified

01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
in 2014 is because staff had noticed
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
that there was confusion among the
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
regulated entities about it
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
was the confusion noted
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh in particularly on the econ situation
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
or was it something else that's not
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
something that i have heard
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't comment on that
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petry
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
did you say collins
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
the the uh he was uh
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah answering his question is that
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
is that the cause of aikman uh
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
landfill in farmington
 
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.390 align:start position:0%
landfill in farmington
no

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a trust there i know
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i was you know the what they had for
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
a reserve in that
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
for that landfill and i know it's
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
maintained by
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
an outside entity
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
because for the reason of taxation
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
because now the town of farmington can
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
recoup their
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
the taxes on a property because it's a
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
private entity
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
the the landfill i'm thinking of is in
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state and
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh has has
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
no responsible party doing any work on
 
01:28:39.199 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
no responsible party doing any work on
it

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
so well it has the state hiring a
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
contractor to do it so
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
follow up how does the cause enactment
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
in farmington how do they maintain their
 
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
in farmington how do they maintain their
uh

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring and whatever
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have information on
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
collins and aikman here with me today
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
because that that is a private
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is a private concern that went
 
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.790 align:start position:0%
that is a private concern that went
bankrupt

01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
bankrupt
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm pretty sure that des does not
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know they mon you know they they're
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
overseers but not
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
they don't take an active role in uh
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me since it's not
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
one that's been brought to my attention
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
is one where we do take an active part
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else have questions yes
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you i'm sorry um again
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
after following up on representative
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
lynn is the problem here the regulations
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and not anything that econ is doing and
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
what i don't understand is is there a
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
regulation change that that
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
should be affected in order to allow you
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
to work with econ
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm baffled as to the range of what des
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
can do and what they can't do it seems
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
to me that working with them should well
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
be within your your purview and your
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
your powers um so where are the where
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
are these rules that don't allow you
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
to work with them in this way and is
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
that is that basically the problem
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
we can uh we can work with them and
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
problem solve within the requirements of
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
the solid waste rules and the statute
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
149 m i don't have
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
specific citations for you here right
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
as far as a
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
rule change that's not something des is
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
pursuing if someone was to pursue a role
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
or statute change they would want to
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate the
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
impact on um the other 400 closed
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
landfills and how that would affect the
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte
 
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.510 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte
um

01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
could you could somebody provide me the
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
list or us maybe with the list
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the 27 towns who were originally
 
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
of the 27 towns who were originally
involved

01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh or point me to a website or something
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
or where i could just see what those
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
towns are absolutely thank you we could
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
send that to janet if you would
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
so you know in follow-up to to i think i
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
i share some of the same kind of
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that representative murray
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
shares and that that is this
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
suppose that you say that you know the
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
the landfill operators to draw any
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
further money out to pay for ongoing
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
operating expenses from
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
but let's suppose if i am i understand
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
correctly that if the state decided
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
that it was going to take over this
 
01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
that it was going to take over this
landfill

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
you would you would succeed
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
to the trust
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct whatever the balance is
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
left in that you would
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
you would be
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
you would be entitled to take that over
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
and have that as an asset from which i
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's the whole purpose of having
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of the trust so
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that you did that
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
could you then use money in that trust
 
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.350 align:start position:0%
could you then use money in that trust
to

01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
pay for operating expenses
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
to pay for the maintenance and
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring yes so
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay so i mean it's
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
this seems kind of circular if we
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you can do that
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
why couldn't you decide
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know just as a discretionary matter
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
to just say
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
well if we take this over we're going to
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
spend the trust money to for for ongoing
 
01:32:37.199 --> 01:32:38.629 align:start position:0%
spend the trust money to for for ongoing
maintenance

01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
the people that are operating it now are
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing a pretty good job of that why
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't we just let them do that even
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
though it does
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
reduce the trust
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
amount because we would be reducing the
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
trust amount anyway if we took it over
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
because it's it's two separate portions
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the rules um and we have a solvent
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
permittee in this case so the rules
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't allow it
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and we take very seriously not
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
exceeding the authority that's given to
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
us by statute and rule
 
01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
us by statute and rule
so

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
so
if

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
i if we amended this bill to say
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh the 200 million dollars
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
no that
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
was whatever the figure was no no no no
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
how much is currently in your set aside
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
200 000
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
500 no no no no set aside oh yeah 200
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
000 right and that's earning interest
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
or something something it's earning
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
something okay
 
01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:41.189 align:start position:0%
something okay
it's

01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's kind of probably like my money
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
market or something or other but okay
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
so we could amend the bill to say
 
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
so we could amend the bill to say
that

01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:51.990 align:start position:0%
that
uh

01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
as far as this landfill is concerned
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
200 000
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
in this whatever it is meets the
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
01:34:01.199 --> 01:34:02.310 align:start position:0%
requirement for
the

01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
the
whatever

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
assurance fund
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
and just leave it at that
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
i mean and that way that covers
 
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.750 align:start position:0%
i mean and that way that covers
des

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
it covers
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh econ
 
01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.470 align:start position:0%
uh econ
and

01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to spend five hundred
 
01:34:24.639 --> 01:34:25.830 align:start position:0%
we don't have to spend five hundred
thousand

01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
dollars i mean i'm just
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
can i i'm just making you know i'm i'm
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
like hearing this
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
really really circular argument that's
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
going around
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i you know i'm i'm having some
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
problems representative heath please
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
instead of doing that would it be
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
possible to grant
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
des waiver authority
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
and be very specific
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
in relation to the terms of that waiver
 
01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
in relation to the terms of that waiver
and

01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to go forward and
 
01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to go forward and
then

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
again in
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i think
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
we may have maybe 30 years from now the
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislators will be hearing the same
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
thing i don't know because i mean this
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
has the potential for some real problems
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
um but if des had that waiver authority
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
there might be other circumstances where
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
they need to do certain things like this
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
this seems like the rules are awfully
 
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.790 align:start position:0%
this seems like the rules are awfully
rigid

01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
rigid
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
well we can't waiver the rules as you
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
know that's
 
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
know that's
that's

01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
not our purview
 
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
not our purview
uh

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
jalgar has approved the rules
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
and probably there is
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in legislation
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
that says other than
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
des will make rules
 
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
des will make rules
so

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
all that we can
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
i think all that we can do is say
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know this works
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.910 align:start position:0%
i mean
obviously

01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know any rule that we have can be
 
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.470 align:start position:0%
you know any rule that we have can be
waived

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
waived
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
however as i'm listening to the
 
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
however as i'm listening to the
testimony

01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
des is not at this point
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
willing to waive that rule
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's how that's what i'm
 
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
i mean that's how that's what i'm
hearing

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
and um and so
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
all that we can do in legislation is say
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
what they have
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that they can spend money out of the
 
01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.510 align:start position:0%
and that they can spend money out of the
remaining

01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that appears to be
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
to me anyhow
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
may i just make a comment on that
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure i think i mean i think your
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
analysis is exactly correct but i think
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
i guess what
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
from my perspective what i would say is
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
if we reject this legislation
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
then des will be in a different position
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
and they will have to decide
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
whether they want to take over this
 
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.030 align:start position:0%
whether they want to take over this
landfill

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
landfill
or

01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
no they excuse me let's let's go ahead
 
01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.189 align:start position:0%
no they excuse me let's let's go ahead
mark

01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
tell us what you wanted to say so just
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
getting back to the 200 000 so there's
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
other parts and pieces that make it very
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to just make certain
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
assumptions with that money and what it
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
can be used for so that was set aside as
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
part of the purchase and sale and
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
indemnification agreements that it only
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
has a specific purpose and i am told by
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
our attorney that we would be in trouble
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
by the uh charitable division if we
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
start taking money and use it for
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
unintended purposes and that might
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
prevent or present some personal
 
01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.189 align:start position:0%
prevent or present some personal
liabilities

01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if we would be able to
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
amend the amendment the only way wait
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking for that money to go
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
anyplace other than to be targeted
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
if after
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
another 15 years
 
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.189 align:start position:0%
another 15 years
you

01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
the landfill falls apart
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not yep so that that that's
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
our our thought process with des is to
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
have them allow it but the only way i
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
think that would happen
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
is if they were to give us some sort of
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
waiver that if we were ever called on
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
the 27 towns to use the 200 that they
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
would release that from the financial
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
assurance mechanism because if it's part
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the financial assurance mechanism we
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
have to wait for them to allow us to
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
spend it and if it is restricted from
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
what its current use was
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
then we cannot put it there
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
so we still haven't had that negotiation
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
with des
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
but we cannot just arbitrarily put that
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
in and i'm not sure
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
if this group can to be honest um just
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
because it's got to be the des that says
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes we know you're using financial
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
assurance but here's the thing the only
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
time that 200 000 we've got to get out
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
of this thought process okay
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
the thought process is number one i'm
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
not going to give you 500 dollars
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay and i don't think there's anyone
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
else in this room that is willing to do
 
01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
else in this room that is willing to do
that

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
if there is speak up
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
but i haven't heard from the questions
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that that is even a possibility
 
01:39:27.119 --> 01:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
that that is even a possibility
so

01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do i think and what
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to do
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
is to somehow or other
 
01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
is to somehow or other
help

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%

the question for sarah if you could do
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
me a favor in addition to the 27 towns
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
could you confirm one way or another
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
that the rule change that was done in
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
this says 2013 but i guess it went into
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
effect 2014
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
that it in fact was not done
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
specifically for this

01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
detailed records of uh what goes on in
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
jail car like
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know i mean
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we have transcripts of those
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
meetings so we can go back and review
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the court reporting and and see
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
if there was any discussion relative to
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
representatives question whether it came
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
up a gel car anyways yeah
 
01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
up a gel car anyways yeah
okay

01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.310 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
does somebody
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
is that something you can easily find or
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
is that a heart no we actually our
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
office maintains those transcripts so
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
we've got those so i just need to find
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
the right meeting and look okay okay
 
01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.229 align:start position:0%
the right meeting and look okay okay
so

01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up clarification because
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
now i understand what you're saying and
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciate it so you're
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
saying that there's somehow some way if
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
we put an amendment that just asked
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
is it an act of the legislator that will
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
say d-e-s you will accept this 200 000
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
as the obligation and they
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
need to follow again i i'm very green
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay i get it i was totally mis yes i
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
totally misunderstood but now i get it
 
01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
totally misunderstood but now i get it
okay

01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
on this rule change
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
were there any other landfills trusts
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
that were affected
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
as econ has been affected by the rule
 
01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.990 align:start position:0%
as econ has been affected by the rule
change

01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
and if you don't know the answer if you
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
could find out
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
i want to be sure that i understand your
 
01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
i want to be sure that i understand your
question

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.109 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
affected in financially in other words
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
when the rule change went into effect
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
were there others that were
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
short of money that they had to
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
then pony up
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
to get back to the 30-year rolling
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
versus fixed
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is a this
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
sounds like this is a not withstanding
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then and then whatever you want to
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
put in there about the 200
 
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.430 align:start position:0%
put in there about the 200
because

01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a special bill that's coming
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the second year and
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get it through anyway
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
even if we wanted to
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i i agree
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you apropo uh representative
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
turcotte um and the question of who else
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
would have been affected um there's a
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
uniqueness here in that if another
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
landfill might have been affected they
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
could rely on their tax base or they
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
could rely on their community the you
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
know the the community township or
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatever municipality for that taxes and
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have that option so i think
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
to be clear with his question um in
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
looking at who was affected the
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances of how they could acquire
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
money to uh meet the financial assurance
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
is important because the municipality
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
would not would be able to do this where
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
econ is clearly in a position where they
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
can't so does that
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm thinking it would be helpful
 
01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.390 align:start position:0%
yes i i'm thinking it would be helpful
if

01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
if there are other landfills that were
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
affected if there was a list and it
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
indicated whether it was a public or
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
private entity and had the name of the
 
01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:34.390 align:start position:0%
private entity and had the name of the
permittee

01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
permittee
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:37.669 align:start position:0%
that would be great
okay

01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh thanks again sarah for taking my
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
question um is this a
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay i understand it's a lined landfill
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably properly capped
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
what are the tests showing
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
coming from this
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
landfill i mean are they
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know are they pretty much uh petered
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
out as far as you know vocs and whatever
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that mark may have that
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
information more closely at the front of
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
his mind
 
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.510 align:start position:0%
his mind
um

01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
so again i'm probably speaking way out
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
of my subject matter but i do know that
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
over time the leachate itself has
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
reduced substantially and the only way
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
that that 200 000 can be used for
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
catastrophic that we were talking about
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
was if we had like 40 000 gallons a year
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
right now we're doing like 5 000 every
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
so we are in we are trending with all of
 
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.350 align:start position:0%
so we are in we are trending with all of
the

01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
metrics in a positive way the only parts
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
of pieces we don't know again not to be
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
specific but there's some new testing
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
with pfas
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we still do not know
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
and again i don't want to speak out of
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
turn but but the answer is it's trending
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
very positively
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
right and have you been approached by uh
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
these solar companies to uh
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
put a solar farm uh well i know i know
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
our town that's what they do
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
and uh a source of revenue which would
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
probably help in your situation and it's
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
quite a p uh 80 acres is pretty good
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
piece of land
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
so we did go down that path as one of
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
our alternatives and
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately where it's located is
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
right between newport and claremont and
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
it does not have
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
three-phase power and the cost of
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
three-phase power was going to be a
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
million and a half
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
so the cost to get us power in order to
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
do it made it
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
not viable but that's a great solution
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
and that was one of our first thought
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
processes but we just can't get there
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:50.639 --> 01:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:46:56.639 --> 01:46:58.149 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
okay

01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:58.159 --> 01:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
okay
obviously

01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
we still have a lot more thinking to do
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.270 align:start position:0%
on this
so

01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
schedule another
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
sometime

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
um shortly
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think we have until
 
01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.350 align:start position:0%
i think we have until
march

01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.189 align:start position:0%
march
10th

01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
10th
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
but it'll be long before that
 
01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.669 align:start position:0%
but it'll be long before that
um

01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
because des owes us some
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
things okay
 
01:47:32.719 --> 01:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
things okay
and

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
we we need to try to figure out
 
01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.070 align:start position:0%
we we need to try to figure out
um

01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
am i wrong to suggest that there's
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
anyone here
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is willing to
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's where we're okay so
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at
 
01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:03.350 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at
so

01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
i guess that the real thing is is that
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
we need to try to figure out if there's
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
a way
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
make what make what they have
 
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.070 align:start position:0%
make what make what they have
work

01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
and it may not
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
it may not be
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
the best solution
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
but it is a better solution
 
01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.149 align:start position:0%
but it is a better solution
than

01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:29.590 align:start position:0%
than
econ

01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
econ
 
01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.870 align:start position:0%
econ
going

01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i mean i i do know that the economic
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
council there
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
as mr lucas explained
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
the town back newport back
 
01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.629 align:start position:0%
the town back newport back
to

01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know to give them
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
a sense of
 
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
a sense of
positivity

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
positivity
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that's occurring outside of
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and um and so
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know we we we just need to try to
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to uh
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
to solve this so
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
i will um i'll schedule this
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
probably someday
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
we still don't know when we're going to
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
have session okay which is
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
unless len knows i don't know that we
 
01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
unless len knows i don't know that we
know

01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware if it's actually been
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
publicly announced i do am aware but at
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
this point since it hasn't come from the
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
speaker's office
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay i know that we had talked about it
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
being the week of the
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
14th and
 
01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.709 align:start position:0%
14th and
so

01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh i'll
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
i'll wait for that
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
but uh because it'll either be
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
the week of the 14th or the following
 
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
the week of the 14th or the following
week

01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think you're correct about
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
the committee going down the road of the
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
my my major concern i think it's
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative lens has the same concern
 
01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
representative lens has the same concern
is

01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
if we can find a solution that it cannot
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
be on a
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
i hate setting precedence i hate doing
 
01:50:24.159 --> 01:50:25.830 align:start position:0%
i hate setting precedence i hate doing
one-offs

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
one-offs
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
for this situation because there'll
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
always be a next situation when we do it
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
so if we could just keep that in mind
 
01:50:32.719 --> 01:50:34.709 align:start position:0%
so if we could just keep that in mind
yeah

01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
can i just follow up on that sure and i
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know i'm bang my gather
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
i understand completely your desire to
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
to you know to find i mean this is it
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
seems to me this is a situation where
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's kind of operating in good
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
faith that you know it's trying to do
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
the right thing i completely understand
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
that and i understand the desire you
 
01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.669 align:start position:0%
that and i understand the desire you
know

01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
for a solution can i could i just
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
suggest though that
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
it may be that this is not something
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate for a legislative
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
solution in other words if we were to do
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
something like say
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
create a carve out
 
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.669 align:start position:0%
create a carve out
for

01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
and pass a special law dealing with this
 
01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.229 align:start position:0%
and pass a special law dealing with this
situation

01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
i would be really concerned about the
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
precedent we would be establishing as
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
basically leaving
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
saying you know this wasn't i unders i
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
completely understand the parties acted
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
in very good faith trying to say well if
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature would appropriate this
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
money this would be a solution to our
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
problem but if the legislature says no
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
now the ball is back in your court you
 
01:51:43.599 --> 01:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
now the ball is back in your court you
collectively

01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
collectively
and

01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
my sense is that that's really where it
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
should be and
 
01:51:50.159 --> 01:51:51.030 align:start position:0%
should be and
that

01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
des will have to decide
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
is this important enough
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
that you know are we worried enough that
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
we want to take over this landfill and
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
stop what seems to be a pretty good
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
operation even though they don't have
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
all the assurances they should have or
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
are we willing to say okay
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to sort of wave our
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
rules because
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
if they decide to waive their rules
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
the the town certainly i mean the the
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
landfill operators aren't going to
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
object to that and i don't think anybody
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
else has standing to object so
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
they can do this
 
01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.070 align:start position:0%
they can do this
and

01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's really sort of out of our hands and
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
kind of my sense is that's where it
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
should be is out of our hands
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree but
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
we heard what they said our rules are
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
fast hard and fast
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they said so maybe
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
they'll change their mind
 
01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
they'll change their mind
okay
