00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
time being 1:15 we will speak to uh
 
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner Bon Court of the insurance
 
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
department whose Pages start at 295
 
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's right in
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
house welcome commissioner thank you Mr
 
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 align:start position:0%
the record my name is DJ beton Court I
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of serving as the
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
insurance department it is nice to be
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
back with you as a legislator in a
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
former legislator in what I call
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery I appreciate the fact
 
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
that you've got a big job to do and so I
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't have any Grand presentation for
 
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
you this morning I'm going to hit some
 
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the highlights and then we can take
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
this in whatever direction that you
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
would like so in terms of the
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
Department's budget you will see in the
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
documents in front of you that our total
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
budget is approximately $15.5 million we
 
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
are a self-funded agency uh we get the
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
funding for the Department via an
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
assessment of all of the insurance
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
companies that are doing business in the
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that is
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
calculated out as a PR share of the
 
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
total written premium that they write in
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so obviously some of those
 
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
companies are being assessed more than
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
others what is the total do you know I'm
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
sorry what is that total amount of
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
premiums in New Hampshire the total
 
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
amount of premiums written it's over 8
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
billion 8 billion okay 8 billion and if
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a big number and it is
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate the fact that New
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire represents less than one half
 
00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 align:start position:0%
of 1% of the total written premium in
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
the United States of
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
America so we regulate a very lucrative
 
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
industry to be sure uh it also speaks to
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
the regulatory attitude that we take in
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
the sense that we really do try to form
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
close collaborative relationships with
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
industry because we just don't have the
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
leverage uh to be adversarial or
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed in how we approach our
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh duties because we're an
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
awfully small part of that market we
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
represent a very small share of the
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
market but I think our team does a
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job so in any event that is
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
the total budget for the Department that
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
is how it is raised I know that you want
 
00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
to talk and focus on positions so I'll
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
hit upon that so we have 88 authorized
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
positions we currently have eight vacant
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
as you may recall this past late summer
 
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
or early fall Governor cunu asked All
 
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 align:start position:0%
State agencies to go through an exercise
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
by which I think he had asked for us to
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
put forward a budget that reflected a 4%
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
reduction in expenditures we went
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
through that process again despite the
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
fact that none of that hard work is of
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
benefit to you and the Cent
 
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
challenge that you all are going through
 
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
I wish it could be different but
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it is not but nevertheless
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of that exercise we unfunded
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
three uh full-time positions so we
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
certainly tried to carry forward the
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
spirit of what governor C was asking
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
everybody to do at that
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
time so those are the positions you'll
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
see that some of the lines have gone up
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
others have gone down I am very
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
attentive to what the assessment is for
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
carriers the insurance industry at
 
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
present is going through what we call a
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
hard market and so we do not want to do
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to exacerbate what
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
are some of the challenges in the
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
insurance Market at present and so we've
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
tried to really strike a balance uh
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
between having the resources that we
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
need again while not overburdening
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
industry I would note that last year we
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
essentially what it amounts to is a re
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
debate um if I might just depart for a
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
second introduce you to my team here
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
I've got Jennifer Smith who is our
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
legislative director Jason Dexter who is
 
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
our assistant commissioner Ted Perkins
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
who is our business director and Amy
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
doam who is our tax unit director I
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for not introducing them
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
earlier um integral members of my team I
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
think I just made everybody a director
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner I may have just promoted
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
some people on the spot here but the
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
salaries will stay the same
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
let me let me show you um but in any
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
event because of how we managed our
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
budget we were able to as I've said what
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
basically amounts to a rebate back to
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
Industry last year of about 2.6 million
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
so we really did budget very very
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
carefully how that rebate works and Amy
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
can get into the details of it is it is
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
a credit towards their next year's
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
assessment so the assessment for them
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
coming up is going to be $2.6 million
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
less no individual ual companies going
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
to reap any significant windfall of that
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
but again it is helpful and it certainly
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
sets hopefully a tone that we are here
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively with industry
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
and help them work through what is a
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
difficult time so do you mean you're
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
rebating 26 million of what you
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
collected in fiscal year
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
24 I think that's right yep yes okay and
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
did you collect in fiscal year 24 12.4
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
million yes sir okay so you actually
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
10 oh I see oh so you're budgeted 15
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's right right minus 2.6 that
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
becomes this
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
12.4 I got it thank you very much that's
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
right so again that hopefully speaks to
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are very respons POS
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
with how we budget we are attentive to
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
how we spend we do not waste but
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a mission given to us
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
by the state we take that mission very
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
very seriously so those are the big
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
highlights for me Mr chairman and as
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
I've said we can go in whatever
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
Direction you'd like yeah I think we
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
we'll go sort of Page by Page or just
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
have questions um let me just start on
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
this bottom line you said you remove
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
three positions so so should the 88 be
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
85 so we unfund funded three positions
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
they're still authorized but they're
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
unfunded I
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
see but if we wanted to we could
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
unauthorize them
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
or okay um you can tell us the position
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
numbers right y we do at some point yeah
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
that is that in the materials we
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
provided them if not we can certainly
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
get that to you Mr J okay yep no problem
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah all right uh representative
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
coming in good to see you again I'm I'm
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm trying
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
to understand this rebate that you just
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
described so
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
um that rebate it was $2.6 Million it
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
was it was offered or was given to
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
Industry during fiscal year
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
24 no
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
reduce their balance due that they owe
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
on their next assessment so we'll take
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
the authorized budget let's say 5.5
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
million and if there's a rebate or
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
refund that we didn't use the money
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
it'll come off what we collect for the
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
coming but why don't but I don't see
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
that I mean what I what I see is there's
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
an increase there's an increase in in in
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
expenses and revenue from fiscal year
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal year 25 of 2.6
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
million roughly 2.6 million he is
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
speaking to the Personnel lines that the
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
Personnel lines from the previous budget
 
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
to this budget have gone up so I could
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the the policy driver behind
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
that so when I came back to state
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
government in 2017 I was having
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with insurance
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at that time at that time
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
it was commissioner savini followed by
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elias followed by
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner nicolopoulos and the one
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
thing they all said very consistently
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
was we need to get very serious about
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
succession planning in this department
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
we are on the older side of the scale in
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
terms of age and Personnel we've got to
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
get serious about this um my department
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
is uh chalk full of subject matter
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
experts uh they are subject matter
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
experts in some facet of insurance such
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
that anytime an issue comes up I'm going
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
to have somebody in that building that's
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to address that
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
specific issue but we over the past
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
couple of years actually got serious
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
about succession planning and so we
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
started to fill some positions uh that
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
had not been filled before and the idea
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
being that before this institutional
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
knowledge this expertise leaves the
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
building will'll have an opportunity for
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation to be able to learn
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
and train and get experience from those
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
folks uh again because of the subject
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
matter expertise that is needed in our
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
department we can't just take anybody
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
off the street and put them into some of
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
these positions we need people who have
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
a high degree of experience in whatever
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
unit we're talking about here and so
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative I think what you're
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to is yes the Personnel line is
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
going up because we've started to fill
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
some of those positions but in terms of
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
the uh rebate from the last fiscal year
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think Amy can speak specifically about
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm just trying to reconcile
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
what I what I think I heard and I and
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
and I think you confirmed that it's a
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
rebate that was offered
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
in that will that that will reduce the
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the the Assessments in FY 15 uh 25
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
with what representative Maguire asked
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is the so the two that that the
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
2.6 came off of the number in
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
2024 I understand what he's saying to
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah so maybe I'll try let me try to
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
answer and you tell me if I'm wrong
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
which is I believe our budget two years
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
ago had similar numbers to what you see
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the fy2 column in the FY 24 column so
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
two years ago we gave them a budget said
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
15 million right and uh so that's what
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
they collected from all the insurance
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
companies right but they ended up
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
actually spending the 12 point whatever
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
right so now they're giving a credit to
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies of the
 
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies of the
difference

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
yes and and they may this year spend
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
less than the 15 and therefore there'll
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
be yet another credit to I will not make
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
a commitment on what that number will be
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
but yes we budget very tight absolutely
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
I guess that's the thing I'm struggling
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
with is that if the there's so there's a
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
so we know that there's 2.6 million
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to be given to the
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
companies so why isn't that 2.6
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
25 I'm guessing because in the meantime
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
they may have hired a few people that's
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
right and and they may have given some
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
raises right and benefit costs went up a
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
little and things like that right so so
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
we don't know that this year they'll
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be 2.6 short again it might be
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
one it might be some other numers right
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
so correct Mr chairman you have to make
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions that you know potentially
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
you fill every position you don't know
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
what step they're going to come in at
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
all of those types of things so you've
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
got to to budget assuming that you're
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
going to be at full capacity and that
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to expend every line which
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
again in reality has never happened um
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
but you have to assume that and then to
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
your point Mr chair when you get to the
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
end uh you see what you didn't spend and
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's not our money
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's the the company's money and so My
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
Philosophy is you give that money
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
back and the hope is of course is that
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
that benefit will trickle down to the
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
consumer in the form of their being able
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
to get if not reduced premiums at least
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
stabilized premiums do you know how many
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
people work in an insurance industry in
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire oh boy that's a tough
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
question to answer because it depends on
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
how you define it so are you're talking
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
about all of The Producers which is to
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
say all of the independent agents all of
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
the Brokers and things of that nature
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's a tough number to pin
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
down plus then you've got to determine
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
what do you consider to be doing
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire I mean we've
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
got a lot of producers who live in other
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
states but are authorized to write
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire you know do
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
you include them or not um it's a lot I
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
mean let me ask it a different way sure
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
of the 8 billion in premiums how much is
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
paid out in
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
claims versus how much is expense
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I don't know we
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
could try to track that down for you
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd be curious I what's their
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
profit margin is it 10% is you know we'
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
got about represent month so just try to
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
close the door on this issue so this
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
whole business of you know rebates Etc
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
that only affects the FY 2425 bium
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any impact on
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
2627 right because we don't know what
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
the refund will be yet okay
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
till after 30 I think I think I get
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
it okay I
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
mean I guess I'm I'm I have a hard time
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
finding fault here because of the8
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
billion do in premiums the cost of this
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
regulation is like 0 2% or less right so
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very tiny number in the
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
overall scheme of Y right exactly right
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
exactly right um any other we have other
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
question yeah represent people are you
 
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.029 align:start position:0%
question yeah represent people are you
paging

00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
paging
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
through oh yeah go ahead representative
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
people well I mean I actually have a
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
couple of questions so just because we
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at it issues on uh
 
00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at it issues on uh
page

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
295 027 transfers to oit I see that's
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
going up is I just was curious what's
 
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.510 align:start position:0%
going up is I just was curious what's
happening

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
there you don't know they tell us what
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
the amount is and we cut the check you
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
have in beds we do we have two in beds
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the so it's okay I mean any other so
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
this is more Personnel type stuff not
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
moving to the cloud and that would be my
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
assumption all right so you're not sure
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
okay so then the next thing is on page
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
297 um I see under the financial
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
examination division are those the
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
positions that you unfunded or do you
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
have or maybe I'm reading this wrong I'm
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
looking at uh
 
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.390 align:start position:0%
looking at uh
estimates

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
yeah let me see zeros sure so let me try
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
to answer that and maybe I'll get it if
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
not it's okay you can clarify so off the
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
top of my head the three positions that
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
were unfunded one was a position in our
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
fraud division the other was in fact in
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the Property and Casualty examiner
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
Division and the other was in our tax
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
unit and then there was one was that
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
also Jason in the life and health
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
examiner so there so of the four
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
positions that we unfunded two of them
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
are in the examiner realm one in
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty the other in life
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
and health and then as I said the other
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
two were a fraud position and a position
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
unit and so I would assume that's
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in the line that she's
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
referring to yeah the the two here on
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
page 297 got moved to page
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
296 right so you see 68 became 70 on
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
page 296 and two got fewer on page
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
29 my main concern is that you still
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
have what you think is adequate coverage
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
for fraud and examination within the
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
department yes fraud absolutely they are
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
hitting record marks in terms of
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
referrals to the various entities that
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
will actually do the prosecution so our
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
fraud division will work with County
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys they'll work with the Attorney
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
General's office they'll work with the
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
US attorney's office they do a
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job they basically do all or
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
most of the invest investigatory work
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
and they'll package that case up that it
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
is ready to go in the event that a
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in one of those offices
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
determines to move forward with it so
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm very confident that we're not going
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
to uh miss a step with regard to fraud
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
that position has been vacant for a very
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
very long time uh in terms of
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
examination I think we're in great shape
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
there too we always have the option to
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
bring in outside contractors uh to
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
supplement the work of our examiners and
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of using those outside
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
contractors is baked into the cost of
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
the exam itself which is directly build
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
how that work as far as the uh
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
examination of the insurance companies
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
do you go in on like an annual bait or
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
just talk to us a little bit about that
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
whole issue so it depends we do a number
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
of different types of examinations so we
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
do have statutory requirements to
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
examine certain entities for certain
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
things on a set time schedule for
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
example every company in New Hampshire I
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
think within a five or 10 year span has
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
to go through a financial examination
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
where our financial regulation division
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
goes in and ensures that the companies
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
are solvent and there's a lot that goes
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
into that uh that team is uh does a
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
great job I affectionately call them our
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
math nerds um there's a lot that goes
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
into that but obviously it goes to the
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
heart of our consumer protection mission
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the sense that if a company's not
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
solvent or if it's going bankrupt it's
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
awfully hard for them to pay claims in
 
00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:29.149 align:start position:0%
awfully hard for them to pay claims in
other

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
cases um what will happen
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
is our consumer division will begin to
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
hear from consumers about a problem that
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
they're having with a particular company
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
and our consumer division uh works very
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
closely with our Market conduct teams
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
and so when we start to see a trend
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
developing particular problem related to
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
a particular company that will trigger
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
one of those teams saying it's time to
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
go in to do an exam that takes a look at
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
what's happening here to see if there is
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
a systematic problem that is taking
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
place here and by problem we mean uh
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
something that is not in compliance with
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
the rule or the law and so that will
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
drive an examination as well so a couple
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
of different ways that we'll do it some
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
of them are on a set schedule others are
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
driven by whatever the scenario is
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
ground representative Lehman then
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative mik thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
so turning to page 298 getting back into
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
the U employment
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
compensation area and you've got
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
$400,000 if you look at total
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
funds on the state flexibility cycle
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
two um that has all gone away apparently
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
if you carry it right across and the
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
positions have gone away way I guess so
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at that and adding that to
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
the $12
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
million and then looking at what you're
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
looking for $15 million in this coming
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
year it seems like your overall budget
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
has gone up substantially because you're
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
not carrying a lot of those expense
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
numbers into 26 and 27 so I would assume
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
you'd be closer to more like 13 million
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
for per year for 26 and 27 versus 15 I'm
 
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
for per year for 26 and 27 versus 15 I'm
just

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
curious what your thoughts are to that
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
sure well what I would say is I think
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
part of that is driven by the fact that
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
last budget we had a 12% increase in
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what we were going to pay state
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
employees so I think that plays
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
certainly a part in that as well um what
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
you see here in terms of what we're
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
presenting to you again reflects that 4%
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
reduction that we were asked to make
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
last summer in Fall we did move some
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
numbers around based off of what our
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
needs were and what we foresaw as being
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
the needs over the course of the next
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
bium but any other thoughts on that team
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
to go deeper
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
up if you are looking at the um the the
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
393,000 which is in consultant line Y
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
Flex Grant we didn't use any of that or
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
employees those were all consultant
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
contracts that we did rfps we brought in
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
consultants and we paid those funds out
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
and then that Grant has been
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
closed I completely understand that I'm
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
just wonder if you look at the bottom
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
line for your entire department it's $12
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
million the last accurate figure for 24
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
and yet in 26 and
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
27 you're looking for more than 15
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
million and is is that also assuming the
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
4% cut is that not included in the 15 or
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
is it included in the $15
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
million so that 15 as I understand it is
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
we were told to reduce four and then
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
certain things went up like
 
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.389 align:start position:0%
certain things went up like
benefits

00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
and that's after that number is after us
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
not funding the three positions three
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
positions or four positions we've heard
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
four positions
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
I heard
 
00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:33.310 align:start position:0%
I heard
three

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
positions nor normas okay the fourth it
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
would be was a
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
temporary uh
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
position that was Amy's old position we
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
brought her back temporarily to help get
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
month so um I I have I have three three
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to ask the the first
 
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to ask the the first
is

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
um um do you get any revenue does your
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
do you have oversight for health
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
insurance as well we do but I always
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
preface this by saying well we have
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
oversight over represents approximately
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
30% of the health insurance
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
Market in New Hampshire we do not
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
oversee the two government programs
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid okay and we do not
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
oversee self-funded right SL Arisa
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
Arrangements that obviously is overseen
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
by the federal government the US
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so but so the all
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
fully insured health insurance is your
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
your responsibility individual small
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
group and large group markets yes okay
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
um and then um the the appraisal um the
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
appraisal fees that you um assess those
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
companies when's the last time those
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
updated Ral fees he talking about the
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
assessment the administrative assessment
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
to theany the you know your the the fee
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
that you charged to get all the revenue
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
the agency income when when was talking
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
about the IP rate insurance premium tax
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
rate yeah when was that when the last
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
time that was changed sorry I got
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
tripped up on the I believe the
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
legislature revised the insurance
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
premium tax rate in
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
20 2010 somewhere in that neighborhood
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay my understanding is that the
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
motivation at the time was to lower the
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
rates in the hopes that we would attract
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
more insurance companies to New
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not just to write in New
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but to actually domesticate in
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay I don't know how
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's gone other than to say we've got
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
a very competitive market so we do like
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
that okay and then the third and final
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
question for this round um is um that
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
income that you receive uh
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
from um you know these companies the
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
agency the agency income that you're
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
reporting is is that um restricted to
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
for use only by you or can that be used
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
for other purposes as well so the
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax revenue all goes
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the general fund the general fund
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
gets all of that in terms of fines again
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
that and fees that all goes to the
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
general fund I don't know that we retain
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
anything anything the administrative
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
assessment okay the administrative
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
assessments about it so it all goes to
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund it's not um it's not uh
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the term it's not
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
burdened okay one of the items that we
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
included in our house bill 2 submission
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
that was left on The Cutting Room floor
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
was to try to retain a certain portion
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
of the fees that uh excuse me of the
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
fines that our enforcement division
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
brings in to offset the cost of that
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
division our thought process there was
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
that we had filled a position in
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement to try to again keep the
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
assessment as low as we possibly can
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
while also meeting the needs of the
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
department by letting us hang on to some
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
of those dollars we could offset the
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost of that let some of the Bad actors
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
um keep the costs under control for
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
everyone else it didn't end up making it
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
into the governor's proposed budget but
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
that was the only discussion that we've
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
had in terms
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the department hanging on to anything
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
other than the assessment which is used
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.789 align:start position:0%
 
operations

00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
okay so the insurance
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the uh I guess to the general
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
fund is 166 million a year
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
something oh something like that oh
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.190 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
um am I oh wait a minute Insurance
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
yeah am I looking at the right page
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
actually this kind of goes with what
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing I don't quite understand
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
what your source of funds is so could
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
you just like spell it out because you
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
referred funds in terms of how the
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
department is funded yeah so again we
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
will assess all of the insurance
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
companies who are doing business in the
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire those will
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
include companies that you see
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
advertised on television to some of the
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
smaller ones that you wouldn't even know
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
existed until perhaps your agent made
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
you aware that they were there and could
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
provide you with the particular kind of
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
coverage that you need so on a per
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
capita basis of what they write in New
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it goes through a formula and
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is what their assessment is so
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
fundamentally that's how it works Amy do
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
you want to add some meat to those bones
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's uh close to, 1300 com
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
licensed companies in the state that get
 
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
licensed companies in the state that get
the

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
assessment based on the amount of
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
here and we we send out that assessment
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
once a year in
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
September and so when we were just
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
talking about your crediting back 2.6
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
million that wouldn't be money that
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise could have gone to the general
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
fund or or because that okay and then
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
the fine part is what goes to the
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
gotcha is this fines or is it a
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
tax both okay both so the insurance
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
premium tax right into the general fund
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
2% on the health it is but for property
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
casualty it's
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
1.25% okay we've got two different rates
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
depending on the line of business thank
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
you um so insurance premium tax all
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
right into the general fund fines that
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
we assess companies whether they be
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement fines whether they be fines
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
that generate from a market conduct exam
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
again all of that goes into the general
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
fund okay I think representative wer had
 
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.750 align:start position:0%
fund okay I think representative wer had
us

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
hand microphone
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
some years ago I was involved with a
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
study committee where the the
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
Independent Auto Repair people were
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
coming in complaining about the rates
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
they were getting uh somebody has a
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
damage to a vehicle if they go to the
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
Chevy dealer because it's a Chevrolet
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance company pays much higher
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
rate than if they go to their friend
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
down the street he wouldn't get the same
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
money for doing the same repair was the
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
complaint and they also argued that the
 
00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:58.269 align:start position:0%
complaint and they also argued that the
insurance

00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
division didn't have skilled people that
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh knew how to assess damages is that
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
still the case you say you got a lot of
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts so yeah I think
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
we've got the experts to certainly be
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
able to determine damages within what
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
the law dictates what we hear a lot from
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
the shops basically amounts to the fact
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
that they don't like the negotiated
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
rates they're at an impass in terms of
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
what they're negotiating for rates
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
between them and the insurance company
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
we don't get involved in those
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
negotiations typically there are
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions to every rule you may have
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
seen that I did get involved with the
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
contract uh negotiation between St
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
Joseph's Hospital down in Nashua and
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
Anthem not all that long ago there was a
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
very specific set of circumstances that
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
motivated me to do that but in general
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
we allow the parties to negotiate out
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
those details on their own we don't get
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the Contracting process
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if that's still the truth
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
that if I have my Chevrolet in an
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
accident and I go to the Chevy dealer
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will pay him more
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the same repair than my friend down
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
the street that you know gets it and it
 
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.710 align:start position:0%
the street that you know gets it and it
was

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
some initial
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
for a part that was as good as new or
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
something I can't remember but then some
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
company went into business using those
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
same initials sure so when they said you
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
know like new you remember what those
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
there were all nuances that go into that
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of what is negotiated out in
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
the contract I think what you might be
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
referring to are aftermarket parts and
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
the use of those aftermarket parts and
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of that we could certainly bring in
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
our Property and Casualty team that
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
could get into all of the Gory details
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
of how all of that works all right I'm
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you're still getting
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
many complaints from these independent
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
repair places it iies it does vary you
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
know to kind of my ear they've certainly
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
not gone up I think it pretty stable one
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
particular repair guy that stirred up
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
everything that would indeed be the case
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
and um he has since sold his shop and
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't believe the nose dive that
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
the complaint our consumer division has
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
received in terms of uh a decrease in
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
complaints it was
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
extraordinary thank you represent Ms
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and and again forgive me
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
for my uh my my uh math issues here um
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I think I heard you say earlier that
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's about eight billion dollar worth
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
of um coverage out premium premium out
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
there we're we're assessing a a tax of
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
either 1.25 or
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
2% if you do that
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
math um that generates if I'm doing it
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
right generates about just assuming that
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
everything is property and casually I
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that's not the case that generates
 
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.550 align:start position:0%
know that's not the case that generates
$100

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
$100
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
million so is is is that the total
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's being generated
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
and so only a portion of it is what
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here I guess I'm trying to
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand is the total amount that's
 
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.990 align:start position:0%
understand is the total amount that's
being

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
generated by these taxes is it $15
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
million or is it something else let me
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
try representative mon so re the revenue
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
from those taxes is in the back of house
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill one okay it's just like business
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
taxes meals and rooms tax tobacco tax
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
all those kind of things there's a line
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
Insurance 166 million okay yeah so
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's on page it's unnumbered but
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
but it's a big number yeah this part the
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
15 million is simply their particular
 
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.710 align:start position:0%
15 million is simply their particular
operations

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
and they and they charge you know that
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
much just for that but this big number
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
is is a tax on insurance right but the
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
15 million that we're seeing here is
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
part is coming out of that 166 million
 
00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:16.829 align:start position:0%
part is coming out of that 166 million
no

00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
no okay I'm really conf it's a separate
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
think of it this way I'll try to you're
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
doing a very good job Mr Jim I'll try to
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
carry on in your spirit here um it's a
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
separate expense so put simply there are
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
two different obligations the company
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
has to pay the first is their insurance
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
premium tax obligation that's your one
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
in change and then your 2% obligation
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's one piece of it and again all of
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
that goes into the general fund then
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
there is the assessment which funds the
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
department and that's how we are able to
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
operate and exist so what is the
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
assessment so the assessment again is a
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
calculation based off of the prata share
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the premium that you write in New
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so again and I'm going to
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
just throw out some companies that
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
you'll know you know Anthem is our
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
largest health insurance carrier in New
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so obviously their obligation
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be higher than say a smaller
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
lesser known health insurance company
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know same as it would be if you were
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
talking about a Geico or an all state on
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
the property and Casualty side versus a
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
company again you wouldn't even be aware
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
existed were it not for the fact that
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
your independent agent knew of them and
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
knew that they could provide you with
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
coverage and enfor but what is the rate
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
assessment it's a prog of share
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
calculation that's why as he mentioned
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
of of the of the premium tax yes of the
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
amount of Premium of the amount of
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
Premium written not the premium tax the
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
amount of Premium written and I think
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's all prescribed right in statute
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
so so in a sense they take the number in
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
the budget they H they estimate how much
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
premium is going to be written they
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
divide and that's the that's the tax
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
rate right so so they they take the 15
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
million in the budget they take the 8
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
billion that they estimate is going to
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
be the amount of premiums in the year
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
they divide and get 0 2% and then they
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
2% okay
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the year they say
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
oh we didn't really spend 15 we spent 12
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
therefore you have a credit for next
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
year right that's right yes and and if I
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman the
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
problemes and all of fearness to
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative muns um generally we get
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
a good handout from all the different
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and you guys have been good at
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
this in the past but especially to help
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
our newer members that gives a better
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
explan a of everything going on but as
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
far as the insurance premium tax it's
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
like my business pays that because the
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company collects it from me
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
and then sends it to the state but so
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's how that works so it does cost
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
the consumers in the state a lot of
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
money because they're winding up paying
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that fee through the insurance premium
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
tax okay anyway I will certainly make a
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
note to do handouts in the future I was
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on the line for supplies
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly uh put a
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
presentation for you in the future so
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you can have that hopefully you'll
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
make this process a little EAS represent
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
of evil all right so I have a question
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm sort of uh interested in the um
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
staff position you said was left on The
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
Cutting Room floor so I'm interested in
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
your estimates uh return on investment
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
for having another enforcement
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
person um number one and whether the
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement person could have been paid
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of the assessment rather than out of
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
the fines because the fines are things
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
that go into the general fund sure so it
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't a position that was left on The
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
Cutting Room floor rather what we
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
proposed was to account for the fact
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
that that position will be accounted for
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the ass there won't be as much of a
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
rebate going back by virtue of the fact
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
that we filled that position so it's
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
still going to be paid for via the
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
assessment I just tried to get creative
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
and filling the position and keeping the
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
assessment low or as low as we could
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
make it okay well I I'm just interested
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection part of the
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
business so I I was I just wanted to
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
make sure you're fully staffed no
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely we're fully staffed and and
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative to your point the ROI
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of that is a big deal to me we
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
are going through as an organization a
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
strategic planning process and I have
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
made it very clear to the units that got
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
positions that they had asked for or had
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
positioned filled that they had asked
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
for okay that's fine but you're going to
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
need to come back to me and tell me how
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the return on that was have we been
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
able to process things faster have we
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
been able to take on a greater uh
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
workload um are we generating more
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
revenue for the general fund as a result
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
of this we're going to be scrutinizing
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
that very very carefully over the course
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the next year to year and a
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
half do you know how those two tax rates
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
compared to other New England states so
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'm asked this all the time you know
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're pretty low I I can't there may be
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
some that are lower I know there are a
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
lot that are higher I can tell you that
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
where exactly we fall Amy can I can
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
speak to that um we are on the low side
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
but we have a retaliatory tax provision
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
and what that means is we can collect
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
the higher of the company state of
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
domicile rate or the New Hampshire rate
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those situations where
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
um when some states do some things that
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't ordinarily do we get some of
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit of that when California and
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
New York want to raise their taxes
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
because of that provision we make out
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
pretty well on that we don't have to
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
touch our tax rate so so we give them an
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
incentive to move their headquarters to
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that right
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that is certainly The Hope okay I
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
like that all right anybody else else
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
did I see a hand Mr chairman before you
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
let us go I did just want to give you a
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
quick heads up go ahead so another item
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
that we had originally included in our
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
house bill to was a proposed program
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
called the granite state home resiliency
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
and mitigation fund uh as a result of
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
some conversations that we had had with
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
the leadership both in the house and the
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
Senate they asked us to go through a
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
different process to have that proposal
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
vetted and so that currently sits with
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
the house Commerce Committee they're
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
working through the policy of it just
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
very quickly I'll describe to you the
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
program right now and representative
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
muns knows this very well he had me down
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
in his district this past summer I was
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from his constituents about the
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
challenges that they're facing in terms
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
of being able to access affordable
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance coverage as I
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the outset industry is
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
going through what we would call a hard
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
Market just very quickly um the industry
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
is dealing with a lot of losses at the
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
moment some of that is economic driven
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
things like that you're aware of things
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
like inflation and um inflation and
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates the cost of technology
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that technology is great
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's all safety oriented we want people
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
to be as safe as possible in their homes
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
and in their vehicles but that
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
technology is expensive and so when it
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
breaks or when you need the expertise to
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
install or repair it that's obviously
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
more expensive but the other huge driver
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
of the hard market right now are huge
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
cat atrophic weather events the
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hurricanes that Wipe Out the State of
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
Florida the Gulf Coast the Carolinas the
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
horrific wildfires that you saw out in
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
California that hit one of the most
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
expensive property markets in the
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
world those are huge losses and so when
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
the companies are experiencing that type
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
of financial difficulty what they'll do
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
is more carefully manage their risk
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
exposure and so you'll see that in form
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the form of higher premiums or they
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
will withdraw from certain markets in
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
some cases or they'll try to get
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
creative as to where they're going to
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
write and that's a huge problem down in
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
our Sea Coast Area and we're working
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
aggressively through that none of us has
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to control the weather I
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
know all of us wishes that we could but
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that some states have
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
done and that we're trying to bring to
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is to create a grant
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
program that allows for homeowners to
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
apply into that Grant to do something
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of improvement or enhancement
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
of their home or the property and the
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria of those projects
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
is all geared toward a better
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
positioning the consumer in the
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
underwriting process so that the hope is
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that again we will not see some folks
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
being non-renewed the way that we are at
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
present um or we will see their premiums
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
stabilize or come
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
down so the lowest hanging fruit that we
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
think uh this this program could help
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
Advance are the big old oak tree or pine
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
tree that's kind of sort of hanging over
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
the house it's a big tree it's expensive
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
to have it removed somewhere in the
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood my parents just went
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
through it it cost them about
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
$4,000 not everybody has the ability to
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
Fork out
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
$4,000 to get that tree addressed but if
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
they were it would be a huge difference
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
for them in terms of underwriting for
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
their homeowners insurance policy
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
because obviously that tree presents a
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
significant risk to the home and so what
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
we proposed was to retain a million
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of the IP put it into that fund
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
and allow consumers to apply in we have
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
a means test in there so that we are
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
really addressing the granted Staters
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
who could most benefit from that the
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
grants would be capped at
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
$10,000 so if the big issue for that
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
home was a roof typically roofs are
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to cost more than $10,000 to
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
repair but we would at least be able to
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
kick in the first 10,000 for them first
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
come first Ser first come first serve
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
basis once the million dollar is
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
expended that's it for the year uh so in
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
a nutshell that's how it would work
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
again Commerce is vetting the policy of
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
it my hope is that it would come over to
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
you all for examination look I've sat in
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
your chairs before Lord knows
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
representative wer and I were in a
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
really bad spot back in 2011 I
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact fact that you've got
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
to think very carefully and scrutinize
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
every dollar that you've got and how you
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
want to spend it if in the event it is
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
your determination that the million
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
dollars is better spent elsewhere than
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
for this program I understand I would
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
just say one last pitch for the program
 
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about housing and what we
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
can do for housing in New Hampshire I
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
would ask you to bear in mind that you
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
cannot get a mortgage to buy a home
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
unless you have homeowners insurance
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
coverage and so for firsttime home
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
buyers that insurance is a is a burden
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty significant financial
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
burden so to the extent that we can
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
leverage that million to help not only
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
the new homeowners but everybody but I
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
think in terms of impact it would
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
certainly be helpful to them uh bear
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
that in mind as well that all being said
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
if you determine that the dollars are
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
better spent elsewhere what I would ask
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
you to consider is to authorize the
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
program not fund the program reason
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
being is because we are hearing that
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
there is great interest in Washington
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
for these types of programs and there is
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
a real possibility that the federal
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
government will make dollars available
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
to either um motivate states to create
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
programs such as this or to fund the
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
programs that they currently have in
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
place and so what I would ask is again
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'd really like to see the program go
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
forward with the funding but if not give
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
us the ability to have the vehicle ready
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
to go so that in the event EV that
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
Washington makes those dollars available
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've got the structure in the
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
program ready to go that we can just
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
drop those dollars into and head out um
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
no increase in taxes no increase in the
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
assessment for this program no
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
additional staff for this
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
program as I've said the the highlight
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
of it is for your purposes is the the
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars in IP that we would use
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
to fund it so let me ask a question
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
so you give the example of tree falls on
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
house causes a claim okay um and
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
therefore if the program was in place
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
fewer trees would fall on the house
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
fewer claims right that's right okay
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
um is the benefit of fewer claims
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
strictly to the person that owns the
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
house I mean does the when somebody buys
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
insurance on that house do they send
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
somebody out there and say oh tree
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
therefore premium yep right an appraiser
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
will come out an underwriter will come
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
out and do that work right and and and
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
whereas the house next door no tree
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
premium right or is it more that in New
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there's 4,000 houses
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
damaged by trees therefore in New
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance is that much more
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
expensive than otherwise right so each
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
property needs to be individually
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
underwritten okay so that it really is
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
within a again setting aside Financial
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
capacity of the individual it really is
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
within the control of the property owner
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
to do as much as they possibly can to
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the risk that's
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
assessed within that underwriting
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
process look if you're representative Ms
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
and his constituents you can't change
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're living closer to
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic Ocean than I am in
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
Salem that is outside of your control
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
but again in those instances where
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
you've got a variable that you can
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
control such as the viig tree or the
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
fact that the roof needs to be replaced
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
or you can do some things to fortify the
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
foundation of your property as an
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
example that will make it more resilient
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
to flood uh type situations that is
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
within your control those would be the
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
types of things that the program would
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
seek to be able to assist the consumer
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
with so again they'd Faire better in
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
that underwriting process I couldn't I
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't get um homeowners insurance um
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
this year not because I was in a flood
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
plane but because lived a half mile from
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
the from the ocean and the insurer was
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about wind
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
damage that was we obviously to someone
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
else or yeah we found another we found
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
another carrier but um um it was more
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
expensive and the deductible went way up
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
right okay so the state of Alabama was
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually the first state in the country
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
to put this program forward and um so
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
they created the model for the rest of
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
us and it's I joke it's my favorite kind
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
of r and D rip off and duplicate uh but
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
as we bring it to New Hampshire we have
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
tried to New Hampshire eyes the program
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the same types of
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
weather risks in New Hampshire that you
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
do in the Gulf Coast if you're in the
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
Gulf Coast you're obviously very worried
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
about the wind damage that comes from
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
hurricanes or or flood threats that come
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
from those hurricanes in New Hampshire
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
we've got predominantly flood issues
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
we've got Micro Burst issues uh just
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
this past summer we had a Micro Burst
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
that did one heck of a lot of damage out
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
Milford it was a horrible situation so
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
our program is geared towards those
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
types of things so we're not so much
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
worried about strapping of roofs and
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
fortifying walls to those hurricane
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
forced winds we're focused on those
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
things like again fortifying the base of
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
the property to guard against flood to
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent possible the wind
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
and Micro Burst issues again dealing
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
with those trees addressing the roof
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
we've really tried to make it specific
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
to the actual experience that we have in
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I got to say from my
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
point of view you gave me the wrong
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
answer to this question because I don't
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
see why it's the responsibility of
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
people in Epsom to help people in
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
Hampton get get insurance right I mean
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
they get to live near the ocean and I
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't right so it's
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
like I don't see it no I don't see it so
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
much that way Mr chairman because
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
again it's the purview of the individual
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
property owner to talk with the company
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
and say okay where is my property
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
running a foul of your your underwriting
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the individuals say well
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
sir you've got this big dead oak tree
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
and if you address that big dead oak
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
tree you'd Faire better so the
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
individual can apply into the grant get
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
that oak tree dealt with and and fair
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
better as an individual property owner
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
I think where I may have thrown off
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
who's paying the grant though it would
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
come from the
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
IP the insurance premium from the
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
anyways we I will be uh telling our
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
local police chief to keep an eye out
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
for you and keep you off the beach yeah
 
00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.430 align:start position:0%
for you and keep you off the beach yeah
yeah

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative cambr
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh would it be means
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
tested in any way
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes it is means tested and uh the owner
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
would have to provide an estimate first
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
and you would not you said it would go
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
$10,000 but we would would you typically
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
match half of what it would cost or
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
would you if say the new roof only cost
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
99,900 would you give them the full
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
amount no nobody's nobody's making a
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
profit we've got a lot of different
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions in there that hold the
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
contractors accountable uh you know to
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
the extent that the job is quoted at
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
5,000 and only cost
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
four uh it it's so to the extent that
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's a bigger project and some of those
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
funds have to be front loaded and again
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
we worked very closely with the Home
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
Builders Association to understand
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
nuances of this thing some of it would
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
need to be front loaded for example if
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
it was a new roof the contractor would
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
obviously have to pay for those
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
materials up front but they're not going
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
to get the full amount of whatever the
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
total cost of the project is up to that
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
represent W did
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
you we've only got about 30 some working
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
days cut a few hundred million I get it
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
from the budget we're not making any
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
progress here he's self-funded yeah yeah
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's no money to be gotten here I'm
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
surprised we're spending this much time
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
on it well it's just our schedule didn't
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
put the next the next person's coming in
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
so and we we like to talk all right
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative eel for the last thing
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'm going to go back to the
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
assessment again could something like
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
this be paid for through the assessment
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
as opposed through the
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
tax so I originally looked at it a
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways the state of
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma as an example used the fees
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
generated for licensing their Surplus
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
lines companies and thank goodness
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's only five minutes left because
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
we could go down all sorts of rabbit
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
holes about some of these things uh so I
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
looked at whether or not that would be a
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
viable resource for us but again that's
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
still general fund I appreciate uh we
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
only take in as a state about $30 to
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
$40,000 in Surplus lines registration
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
fees not
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
really not really a lot for for the
 
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.589 align:start position:0%
really not really a lot for for the
program

00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
um so if you wanted us to
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
so we do separately assess companies for
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
certain things so for example uh our
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
reinsurance uh mechanism for our
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
individual Market that's a separate
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
assessment um what's the other big
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
assessment we do for getting one of them
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
we can do separate assessments but we
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
would need statutory authority to do
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
that yeah I guess I'm just sort of
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
zeroed in on the fact that you put to
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
you sent 2.6 million back to the
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
insurance company so I was just
 
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if there was some money there
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
that could have been used to fund I mean
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
so we would need statutory flexibility
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
to do that I see yeah I mean because
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's another because that's not gen
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
not going back to the general fund right
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
the assessment money
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
anyway um and to the extent it helps to
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
keep uh premiums down in any way in the
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
state anyway it's just something I was
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
pondering it I appreciate the thought
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative let me look into that a
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
little bit I'm I'm absolutely willing to
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
explore different options to make this
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
work all right so what I'm inclined to
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
do here is is to remove the three
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
positions that are unfunded and
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise keep it the no no other
 
00:58:35.789 --> 00:58:35.799 align:start position:0%
changes what do people think about that
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
that sound good okay so should we have a
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
show of hands on doing
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
that make a yeah so we'll make a motion
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
to he's going to get us the three
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
position numbers we'll take those out at
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of house bill one right and
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
then but otherwise leave the numbers the
 
00:58:52.039 --> 00:58:54.150 align:start position:0%
then but otherwise leave the numbers the
same

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
yeah right from 88 to 85 yeah I'll
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
second your motion okay and show hands
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
have a discussion oh you want discussion
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
ahead well it's just coming
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
forward those unfunded positions can't
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
get funded if they if they have more
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
money they'd have to come back for more
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
positions they affect the
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
G not this year but but oh how do they
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
affect the general fund no it doesn't
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
pays I will get you those numbers before
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the day Mr chairman all right
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
all right so are you ready for a vote is
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
that right okay all those in
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
favor all right unanimous thank you all
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you commissioner thank you
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
all should you need anything else from
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
let's talk more let's talk
 
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
let's talk more let's talk
more

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 297 we had it as a
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment to a separate piece
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation Because by the time the
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership had asked us to
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
go that route and not go the house bill
 
01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:17.799 align:start position:0%
2 route which initially made sense to me
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
because of the budgetary impact we had
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
the filing period for legislation had

okay um so we have no state general
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
funds the majority of our non-matching
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh federal funds comes from
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
usdol uh the banian budget is based on
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
the continuation of core program
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
services employment services
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance and labor market
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
information um our our draw down has not
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
been interrupted uh all programs are
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
being reviewed to determine any
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
potential conflicts with executive
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
orders but to date none of our none of
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
our funding none of the draw down has
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
been affected uh without these Grant
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
dollars we would not be able to
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
administer these programs at least to
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
the extent that we currently do the
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
department also receives supplemental
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
funding from New Hampshire businesses a
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
0.2% set aside of employer paid State
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes fill the gap for
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
administering these programs these
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
employer taxes also provide 6 million
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
annually for the training fund
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
administered in connection with the job
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
training fund uh without these employer
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
taxes the state could not maintain six
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the 12 New Hampshire Works offices
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
located throughout the state all 12
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
offices offer a variety of services to
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
claimants job Seekers and employers uh
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel Services and benefit costs
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
comprise the largest part of our budget
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
61% when unemployment claims increase
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
additional Federal funding based on
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
workloads and excess of our budget
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
workload loads count
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh growing economy and a low
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate results in decreased
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
Federal funding our full-time staff is
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
282 the highest Staffing we had was
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
reached during the pandemic was the
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
equivalent of 355 in April of 2020
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic um the office was we
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
we basically were not able to add staff
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
because uh Friday everything was fine
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
Monday everything went off the cliff so
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically all staff at Employment
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
Security was working 7 days a week uh
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
from from the start of the pandemic
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
through the end of August uh because
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
like I said I mean Friday everything was
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
fine we had no time to train anybody we
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
had to just take on the brunt of it and
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
thanks to our staff and additional
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers from other state agencies as
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
well as the National Guard we were able
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
to put the plan together in order to
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
assist the number of people that we did
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh um so just a quick question sure you
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
have 293 authorized positions so so 11
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
are vacant is that it pardon me I'm
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
sorry there are 293 authorized positions
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
so 11 are vacant because you said you
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
have 282 right now yeah we've got our
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy um there are actually more
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies fulltime permanent vacancies
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
the 282 includes some full-time
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
temporary positions as well oh okay so
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
how many full-time permanent our vac um
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
I believe about 30 at this point wow
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
recruitment Mr chairman what was the
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
question there which number were you
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
looking for how many vacant positions
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
you have out of this 293 I see yeah so
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
about about 30 uh 14 of them are
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
actively being recruited um we are um in
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
the process of seeking approval from the
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
governor with the hiring freeze uh we
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
were being a little bit cautious because
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
of our Reliance on federal funding we
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to see uh what the federal
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
government was going to be doing with
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
some of those programs before we
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
proceeded to hire to fill some of those
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
positions are you spending a lot on
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
overtime or Temporaries or something
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
else no um right now overtime um is low
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
by our standards uh uh claim volume
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
um is low we're back below where we were
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh pre pandemic levels so um uh you know
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
when when claim volume is low um appeals
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
are low um it kind of filters its way
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
through the whole work stream so uh not
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
as much overtime right now not nearly
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
what we were doing when we were a 247
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
operation during the pandemic so what
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
are you going to do with the 14 new
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
people um so those were positions that
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
were filled um they were filled uh they
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
were needed uh they were roles they were
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
um adjudicating claims they were on the
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
the front lines in the local offices
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
providing service greeting people when
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
they come in uh those positions need to
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
be filled um right now existing so that
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
would reduce waiting time in the offices
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
correct uh you know like right now our
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh front desk person for our Portsmith
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire Works office um that
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
position is vacant it the person left
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
that to go to a different job so right
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
now our manager is trying to do that and
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
do about eight other things as well well
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
so it's that's a type of position that
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
we need to fill thank you all right go
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
ahead okay and U um so the um uh the
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic payout uh during during the
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic we paid out over $2 billion in
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
federal and state unemployment benefits
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
to over
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
175,000 workers which was more money and

College uh managing the Unemployment uh
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
so you know the biggest part for Ross 2
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
is trying to get people that have lost
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
employment no fault of their own back
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
into the workforce and to get them back
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible either through
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
training programs that they might need
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
or to assist them to find new employment
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities So currently the
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund is at
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
38.5 million which is close to 100
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
million more than prior to the P
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic um obviously the the higher the
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
claim volume uh that makes an impact on
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
the trust fund and right now we're
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing low un CLA low
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim volume uh we've had
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
19% growth which was another 9,000
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
registered employment establishments
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
since prior to the pandemic the
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
workforce growth is 4.5% which is 25,000
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional drops since before the
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh the trust fund had received
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
109 million in pandemic funding uh
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
through the cares act fund
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh in order to build up because there
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
were a significant number of States
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic uh that basically uh
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
ran out of money to pay unemployment
 
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
claims and had to borrow money from the
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
feds uh the lowest average
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax rate we've had in 30
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
years and it's the lowest uh third
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
lowest tax burden in the country um not
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
a uh budget related item but this brings
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
up something I wanted to talk to you
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
about sure um the tax Foundation puts
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
out this data that rates all the states
 
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.229 align:start position:0%
out this data that rates all the states
on

01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
their uh you know how friendly they are
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
on taxes or something like that and New
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believe it or not is somewhere
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
in the middle you know and in particular
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
they rate US like 26th in this area in
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax when we're like the
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
third best right so have you ever talked
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
to those guys about their methodology
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know cuz that that is just
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
ridiculous in my opinion um so it's a
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting topic and it's one
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
of those where the tax foundation and
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
employment security just had to agree to
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
disagree um the reason why they don't
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
particularly like the um unemployment
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
tax situation in New Hampshire is
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
because there's potential for tax rates
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
to change quarter by quarter uh they uh
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
place a high value on on
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
predictability um and so they don't
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
think that is a good thing um
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that the only uh change
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in statute now are to reduce
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
your tax rate so even though that change
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
is a uh positive for the employer as
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
their tax rate is going down they still
 
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
don't like it because it can change um
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
change when it when it comes to
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax uh change is a good
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
thing you don't want to lock yourself in
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh to a long period of time with a rate
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
that might not be sufficient to support
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the trust fund uh with the claim volume
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
coming in and you certainly don't want
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
to over tax longer than you need to when
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
claim volume is low like it currently is
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
so as the commissioner had mentioned um
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
a the uh the average private sector tax
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
rate in New Hampshire right now is
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
61% they pay that on the first $14,000
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
in annual wages per employee that comes
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
out to about
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
$85 per employee uh that's a third of
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
the uh tax burden um compared to the
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
national average um less than a third of
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
what employers pay in Massachusetts
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
right now um so New Hampshire is an
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
outlier in the Northeast um and I think
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
we will continue to agree to disagree
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
with the tax Foundation um unless the
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature that sets policy
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
changes those solvency mechanisms and um
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
um in the past the legislator has very
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
much liked those fund balance reductions
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
that reduce right so the way I
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
understand it is it could go down four
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
times a year but it can only go up once
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
a year is it could go down three times a
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
year depending on because you have three
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
different levels of reduction um the
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
state used to have uh search charges
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
that could get added to an employer's
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
rate uh those got removed in the 2021
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
reform so that's why I said now the only
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
the only way it can move is with a fund
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
balance reduction lower ing you from
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
your earned rate so maybe it worth for
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
you or me to make a call to those guys
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe they don't know I would I
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
would love to have another conversation
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
with them we we did try uh several times
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic and uh we weren't
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
getting anywhere but um more than happy
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
to try to talk with them again okay
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead yeah the only other
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
piece that I had to mention was it's not
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
a budget related item but we also
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
partner with administrative services in
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
administering the voluntary uh Paid
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
Family Medical Leave Act so we have
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
there's paid coverage currently for
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
24,000 New Hampshire workers and it's
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
available for all New Hampshire
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
employers and New Hampshire
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
workers and with that I'll end our
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah tell me more about
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
that one um The Family and Medical Leave
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
Act how much money is
 
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
involved um so um when the uh Paid
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
Family Leave program was passed in
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
21 um the the statute tasked
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrative services and employment
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
security with operationalizing the
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
program a big part of that was um
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
procuring Administration and the risk
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
associated with the Paid Family Leave
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
benefits so uh we did a competitive
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
procurement MetLife won that contract
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're currently under contract with
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
the state uh through through uh the end
 
01:18:56.239 --> 01:18:57.229 align:start position:0%
the state uh through through uh the end
of

01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
2029 uh so they um they fully administer
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
the program they fully ensure it meaning
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
they take on the risk um I know um admin
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
services with uh commissioner Arling
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
housee and Deputy Commissioner Keen uh
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
they have they U as part of their budget
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
they have the associated State cost for
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
um uh the state as an employer provides
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
this coverage to the State Workforce
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
course um at at the employer's expense
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that um is around a $1.2
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
million cost uh to provide that
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
additional paid benefit for the
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
employees um there are other costs uh
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that I would allow edmin services
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to um the statute required the
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
state to do advertising for the program
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the state currently does that um and
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh does uh social media radio television
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
um Billboards uh to try to help spread U
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
awareness to employers so they know they
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
have that option individuals so they
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
know they have that option um so um a
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
lot of that with with our role a lot of
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
it is going out to Chambers uh going out
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
to different associations and employer
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
groups and helping explain the program
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
and answer questions is this program in
 
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
your budget no the the only portion of
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
it that's in our budget is the uh
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
portion of benefits for our employees um
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
but the the administrative cost
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
associated with uh the advertising and
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
the uh consultant that the state has to
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
assist with Administration uh that is an
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
administrative Services budget got all
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
you um I believe it was initially
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 1.9 million
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
um um well the
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
program the the cost for the state
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
portion is that 1.2 million but you have
 
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.030 align:start position:0%
portion is that 1.2 million but you have
another

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
14,000 uh private sector private and
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
public non-state workers who have the
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
coverage you have another 1,400
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that have purchased it on
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
their own so the the state coverage
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
which the state as an employer pays for
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
um that's a a portion of the pool of of
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
people that have it um the advertising I
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
think I want to say that the actual
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
spend on that was around $700,000
 
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
a year um and I know that admin Services
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
um they can speak to that portion as
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
they administer that as part of their
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
budget so so in what sense are you guys
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
involved um so we we partnered with them
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
on standing up the program we also have
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
a statutory role to administer um there
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
is a fund a dedicated fund that is
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
created to manage the risk associated
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
with the individual pool so New
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um is the only state that
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
actually allows individual workers to
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
purchase their own coverage if their
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't provide it and so that
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
by by its nature is a very risky pool of
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
individuals for an insurance product um
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
so the legislature created a a mechanism
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
so that all of the insurance premium tax
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that is paid by uh metti on the policies
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
that are sold to all these employers ERS
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
that insurance premium tax goes into a
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for which MetLife can
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
have access to if they are able to show
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
a risk of um essentially being in the
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
negative on the whole program um so we
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
have those dollars those insurance
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
premium dollars um they um they come in
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Insurance like
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax on other products
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
and they're dedicated so they can only
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
be used to to provide that risk
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
mitigator to metti if they come in and
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
show us that hey this past year uh we
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
took in this amount in premium across
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
all of the Paid Family Leave products we
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
paid out this amount in benefits
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
therefore we feel we're Justified for
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the money that's in that that
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for that um that risk uh
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
pool that that we manage so we're only
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to pay it out if they
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that to us um to the to uh
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
right now um the program has been up and
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
running 2023 was the first year uh so
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're into our third year uh we have not
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
paid any dollars from that fund to
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
MetLife as of yet uh whether or not
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be seeking payment
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
anytime soon I don't know but uh that
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
has been untouched is this the kind of
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
program where someone can sign up for it
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
once a year during open enrollment and
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
not not any time they want is it for the
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
individuals so an employer can sponsor
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
coverage at any time during the year
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't have coverage
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
through their employer they have a
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
60-day open enrollment period that goes
 
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
from December 1st to January 29th every
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
year um so that there's a lot of
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
advertising that's done in that to to
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
build awareness uh we just finished an
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
open enrollment we had a thousand people
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
submit applications we're now at about
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
1,00 workers enrolled in that uh about
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
75% of them are women 60 % under the age
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
of 45 and big surprise here 80% of those
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
people are using that leave to bond with
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
newborn children uh so uh for those
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
workers those those people they don't
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
have the coverage uh from their employer
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
so it's a an important tool for them all
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
right representative mons you you
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned a contract with metti um
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
what's the term of that contract yeah um
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
it runs till the end of 2029 uh with
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
with a um a 2-year renewal and are there
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
any termination
 
01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions um there are standard
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
termination Provisions if they fail to
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
deliver uh the services that they're
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
required to under the contract for
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
instance they are required to provide
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
both uh the uh coverage available to all
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employers uh to purchase
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
that it's individually underwritten for
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
each employer depending upon their
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
demographic but they're also required to
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
administer the individual pool so they
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
have to provide that coverage as well if
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
they fail to do that we could terminate
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
but it's other than that it's standard
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
termination Provisions in that what is
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
there would the state have an obligation
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
if the state chose to to terminate the
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
pro the program and terminate the
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
contract is there an obligation that we
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
would have to pay um that would be a
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
question for the Department of Justice
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
um uh as they would handle those
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
questions but U if we were to terminate
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
it for a reason that's not an allowable
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
reason under the contract then there
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
would be risk for the state okay thank
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative Griff and then
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah thank
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
you I've I've got a couple of questions
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
one is how many physical locations do
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
you have and and uh can claims be made
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
at all those locations yes claims could
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
be made at all and we've got 12 physical
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
locations plus two
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
satellites we operate as well and my
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
next question is it looks like you got
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
um uh do
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
it and um I'm wondering what what they
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
do is is it a new system or or has the
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
system been in place a while it seems
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
like a lot of people to me for to run a
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
relatively simple system I would think
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
um so the um unemployment benefit system
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
itself is a fairly complic licated
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
system so individuals it's you know it's
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's an online system so individuals can
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
file from anywhere both their initial
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
claim their continued claims our staff
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
that review those claims to make sure
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
individuals are eligible they do all of
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
that adjudication work within the system
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
so that's that's our biggest most
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
complicated it system um and the
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
department of Information Technology
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
they have uh managed the hardware
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
associated with that and the production
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
environment associated with that
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
together with our other systems our tax
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
related systems and our wage system um
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
right now all of those systems operate
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
from an on premise data center that's
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
right here in conquer um there there is
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
a plan that we have been working on to
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
bring at least the unemployment system
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
itself to the cloud taking advantage of
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
some other Technologies um that will
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
reduce our doit footprint in terms of uh
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
the number of uh database administrators
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
that will need and other types of roles
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh people that uh we have a uh a a batch
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
process that occurs uh five nights a
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
week that needs people um in order to
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
make sure batch runs and that claims get
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
updated and paid that next morning those
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
types of processes will go away once we
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
go to the cloud so there's an an
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
undetermined um amount of reduced
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
spending and reduced FTE from doit that
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
we will U be looking at for our new
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
reality once we do make it to the cloud
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh so that will be that will be
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
something that will be changing and we
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
very much want to get out of U managing
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
our own data center it's a it's a
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
headache for us that we're we're ready
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
to get away from and if what what is the
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
timable for that to happen uh for the
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
the cloud migration will be occurring
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
during this calendar year um is our is
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
our goal um there's some Federal
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
modernization money uh that the
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
department was awarded um with along
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
with 18 other states it was a
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
competitive uh procurement uh
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially process within the US
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um so some of that
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
will need to uh be further accept and
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
expend down the road once uh those
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
dollars are finalized with USD but it
 
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
will it will essentially be paid for uh
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
with one-time modernization money from
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh for that
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
migration to the cloud and and initial
 
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
Administration cost all right
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ms then representative
 
01:29:32.669 --> 01:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
eil and then we'll have to stop okay
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um does the um does the trust
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
fund have a investment manager and is
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
there an investment
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
policy um so the trust fund dollars are
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
that you see there uh with right around
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
390 million those are New Hampshire's
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars to pay out benefits but it does
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
not sit with New Hampshire so it sits
 
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
with the US treas treasury um they pay
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
they do that for every state so it's all
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
each State's unemployment compensation
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund sits with the US Treasury uh
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
they do pay us quarterly interest on
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
that at a uh rate that um uh
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
administrator Revels uh can speak to uh
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
but we do get credited for that interest
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
we draw down uh from those dollars into
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
our local account here that sits with
 
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
Citizens Bank out of which all of the
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
benefits get paid we do that on a weekly
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
basis um and then dollars as they come
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
in from employers for the tax payments
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
those dollars then flow through our
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
citizens account to our trust fund
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
account in Washington so we don't manage
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
those dollars they get managed for us by
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government as they do with
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
all other states then the um the the
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
federal the federal the federal funds
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we get um is that a separate is
 
01:30:51.629 --> 01:30:51.639 align:start position:0%
that a separate Revenue stream I mean is
 
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not going into the revolving
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
fund and then coming out correct those
 
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
the the administrative dollars that we
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
get uh for the unemployment program for
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
the um labor market uh information
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
programs in for our Reemployment
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
programs those are all administrative
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
grants that those come in separately we
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
draw down from those separately uh they
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
do not touch the dollars that are in the
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh trust
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
fund all right representative evil um I
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
was going to ask a question similar to
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
that but as far as the interest that's
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
credited back that you were talking
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
about from the federal government does
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that go into the fund or how is so it's
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
reinvested it goes into the trust fund
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay and then the other just a very
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
quick comment um I have a friend whose
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh husband is dying of Parkinson's
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
disease and their son was able to Avail
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
themselves of this program they um work
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
for they he works for a private employer
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
in the North country and I can't uh say
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
how much the family appreciated being
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
able to participate in this program for
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for your part in it great to
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
hear all right um unfortunately we've
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
run out of time and I don't I'm not sure
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
that we've run out of questions so we
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
may either ask you some more offline or
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
ask you back at some point uh before the
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
end of this process all right thank you
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
all right and we are now going to the
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
judicial Council which is on page 510 so
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
page if they're
 
01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:40.770 align:start position:0%
here which I guess
 
01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:43.030 align:start position:0%
here which I guess
[Laughter]

01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%

01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
I would just want to say this is one of
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
seems like one of the most efficient
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
things I see in house bill one in the
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
sense that they managed to spend $40
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
million a year with three
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%

but you're going to explain and um and
 
01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%

01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the groupings of the of the
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%

01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%

01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
as a disinterested forum for the
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%

legal
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
assistance most people have never heard
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the judicial Council and it is
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
confusingly named because although we're
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
called the judicial Council we are not
 
01:39:09.589 --> 01:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
in fact part of the judicial branch we
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
are uh an executive branch agency um
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
however despite not being well known the
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
work has a remarkable scope and impact
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
across the state for example in any
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
given court on any given day there are
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
likely to be several attorneys doing
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
work supported by the judicial Council
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
in a single Courthouse there could be a
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
public defender representing a client on
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
trial in the next an attorney advocating
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
for a parent while in the same hearing
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
AA Guardian ad lium could be testifying
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the child in their best
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
interest and down the hall from that
 
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:43.639 align:start position:0%
hearing there could be a pargal from New
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Legal Assistant speaking on
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of a victim of domestic violence
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the work of all these attorneys
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
Guardians at Liam and the organizations
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
is vital to the administration of
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
justice in the state the impact of the
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
work spans
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
Generations I would like to take this
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address what is the most
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
pressing issue in the current budget and
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
that is inadequate funding of the New
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender for decades
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state has relied upon the public
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
defender to provide Indigent defense
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
Services throughout the state as I
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the public defender
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
provides trial level advocacy Services
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
appellate services and administrative
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and Training Services for the majority
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
of indent defense cases in the last few
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
years the public defender has be has
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
come under considerable strain cases
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
have become more complex and case loads
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
have become and stay too high I've
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
outlined some of the factors leading to
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
these issues in the handout they include
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
the increased complexity of each case
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
longer case periods and increased
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
expectations related to evaluations and
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
treatment case loads are set forth in
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
the public defender contract generally
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
public defenders are supposed to have no
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
more than 70 cases at any given time
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's a mix of felonies misdemeanors
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and other case types such as
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
delinquencies sentence related cases
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
violation violations of
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
probation most attorneys in at the
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
public defender now greatly exceed that
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
70 case limit some attorneys have over a
 
01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:12.910 align:start position:0%
70 case limit some attorneys have over a
100

01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
cases the high case load combined with
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
relatively low paid compared to other uh
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
offices and other public defender
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
offices has caused more and more
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys to leave the public fender for
 
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
attorneys to leave the public fender for
other

01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities this attrition has not
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
only led to high turnover among new
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys but has led to a lack of the
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
experienced attorneys the program allies
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
upon to handle more difficult
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
cases this attrition has also left
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
certain offices extremely short staffed
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
for example the Littleton office was
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
covers several courts in the North
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
Country Now only has two attorneys it
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
should have four that has required to
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
start Closing Services to certain courts
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
leaving the judicial Council to find
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
other attorneys likewise why a Sullivan
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
County public defender now only has two
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
of the four attorneys it
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
requires the increases in the public
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
defender budget that the council has
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
recommended are aimed most importantly
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
at increasing Staffing levels to bring
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
loads the increases are also aimed at
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
raising salaries for public defenders
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
particularly at the lower end the
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
current starting salary at nhpd is lower
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
than at any prosecutor's office in the
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
state and lower than any other public
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
defender in New
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
England as outlined in the chart on page
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
six of the handout attrition at the
 
01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:31.639 align:start position:0%
public defender has rapidly increased in
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
the last few years in the current fiscal
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
year the attrition rate just until the
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
end of January has already been 14% of
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys because the public defender is
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit that contracts on a biannual
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
basis it is vital that the program has
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
an accurate budget upfront so that it
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
can plan appropriately for future hiring
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
the state is obligated constitutionally
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
to provide representation regardless of
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
whether the public defender can take a
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
case when the public defender is
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
unavailable the council must then pay
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
either a signed or contract councel to
 
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
take these cases using Pay paying for
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
Council by each either of these methods
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
increases costs so ultimately if there's
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
not a public defender available the cost
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
increases to the state when the council
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
has to pay for those
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
methods there's also a shortage of
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys willing to take take cases in
 
01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
more rural areas in more rural parts of
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state this can lead to Long delays
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
in finding
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys when the judicial Council must
 
01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
locate private Council to take cases
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
this can easily overwhelm the number of
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are available in a given
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
area to take cases this leads to a
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
backlog of defendants who do not have
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers this includes defendants who are
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I have seen cases in my
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
time with the judicial Council when it
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
is taken over 6 weeks to find counsel
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
for an incarcerated person at one point
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
there were over 40 incar people awaiting
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
Council and many of those people were
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
weeks lengthy detention without Council
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
not only invites litigation against the
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
state for constitutional violations but
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
causes delays for courts victims and the
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
administration of justice cases simply
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
cannot proceed without Council when it
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
is constitutionally
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
required in short adequately funding the
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
public defender not only ensures that
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
the state meets its constitutional
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
obligations but it is also more cost
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
effective in the long run
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
the next priority I'd like to discuss is
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
the agency itself the agency has a broad
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
mandate and a budget of close to $40
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
million and it only has a full full-time
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
staff of three as it stands currently
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
the agency staff struggle to keep up
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
with the increase in bills submitted to
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
the agency these bills must be reviewed
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
for accuracy and the staff of the agency
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
routinely find and correct issues with
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
complex complex attorney and vendor
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
bills that are submitted mostly in paper
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
form after review
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
currently every single attorney invoice
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
expert Bill and other expense must be
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
manually reviewed and approved by me and
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are over 8,000 a year as noted by
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
the recent LBA audit an additional
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
financial position would Aid in
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
financial oversight and improve
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
Financial processes at the
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
council I would next like to mention the
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
budget lines for assigned Council
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
guardians of lium and contract Council
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
because of increasing case complexity
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
increasing payment responsibilities for
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
children and increased rates these bills
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
are virtually certain to increase future
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
years the judicial Council will likely
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
need to request additional funding for
 
01:45:26.679 --> 01:45:27.550 align:start position:0%
need to request additional funding for
these

01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
lines finally the council strongly
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
supports the continued funding of both
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
Casa and New Hampshire legal assistance
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
Casa provides a great service to New
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children at significant
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
savings to the state a casa Advocate is
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
a volunteer who advocates for a child's
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
best interest in court Casa trains these
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
children excuse me trains these
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers and also provides legal
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
support to their volunteers by
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
partnering with Casa the state gains a
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of volunteer
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
assistance in taking these cases which
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
also saves the state money New Hampshire
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
legal assistance is also a vital source
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
of services for domestic violence
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
survivors veterans the disabled and all
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
who would otherwise lack access to Legal
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
Services New Hampshire legal assistance
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
has been a leader in successfully
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
piloting the use of par professionals
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
who can advocate for victims of domestic
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
violence in court when they would
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise not have
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
representation the work that New
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Legal Assistant does also
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
recoups significant amounts of money for
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
the state by obtaining Federal benefits
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens that they are
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%

benefits to New Hampshire citizens I
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
have had the opportunity in my time at
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
the council to view both Kasa Advocates
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%

leishman thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
welcome good to see you as
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
always so I'm looking on page three of
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
your document on the top you've got the
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
adjusted Governor's recommended budget
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
of 28 million then the judicial councel
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation of 37 million uh as you
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
know coming before fiscal looking for
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
additional funds I think two or three
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
times this last
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
year um the governor's recommended
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
budget is about $10 million is less than
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
what you
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
proposed um was there hope there in the
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
governor I can't speak for her that if
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
you needed additional funds you just
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal because you have that
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
ability to do that I I certainly
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak to thinking of others but
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
I would I do want to reiterate one point
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
that I think is important for the public
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
defenders budget line which is that
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
because it operates on a contractual
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
basis it is slightly different in terms
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
of planning and going back for funding
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
you the public defender greatly benefits
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
from having a a known budget upfront
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
because it needs to make hiring
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
decisions months in advance other types
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
of bills that we come that the judicial
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
Council comes back for for funds such as
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
a sign Council those bills come in on a
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
rolling basis whereas the public
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
defender although it can come back for
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
additional funds it sign it that is done
 
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
through a two-year contract through an
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
RFP that the public defender bids on
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
essentially so the difference there is
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
that for P for planning purposes in
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
order for the public defender to know
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
how many attorneys it can hire what the
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
training is going to be what offices it
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
can staff having those funds upfront is
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
tremendously beneficial um and I and
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the distinction between
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
what I put in terms of the governor's
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
budget as as currently written and what
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
I understand to be perhaps an adjustment
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
in what was intended um my understanding
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
was there was an error in the process of
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
um looking at the judicial council's
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
budget and we came in lower than had
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
been intended by the governor's office
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
by about $2 million thank you thank you
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr chairman okay other
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
question no representative
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
wer how do you determine that someone is
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
Indigent um that determination is made
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
by the courts they use a form the clerks
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the courts use a form to determine in
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
iny that's not made by us is whatever
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
they write down is is no no doesn't have
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
to be any investigation or
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
something there's there is a form that
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
someone fills out under under oath I
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
believe and that's looked at by the
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
clerks the courts then have the ability
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
to further inquire if they don't find
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
someone's representations credible do we
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
clients not that would go through the
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment uh that
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that judicial
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
Council has been involved in
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
historically my understanding is
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
generally in the past if someone was
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
found Indigent and qualified for
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
services there would then be a payment
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
made through the office of Cost
 
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
made through the office of Cost
Containment

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
Containment
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me when we're
 
01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:56.679 align:start position:0%
handing out money from the state we
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
ought to be a little more careful of who
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
it goes to and who we hire Council for
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
somebody might be able to afford
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
it that that may well be uh at this
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
point the judicial Council I think
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps appropriately so we don't make
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
those determinations you know that
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that's made at the
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
judicial branch level so I don't have
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
any part in in making those
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
determinations thank you representative
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
evil did you well I I I was just
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
interested to see your reference to the
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
YDC cases on page nine are you involved
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
in some of those um lit pieces of
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
litigation yes that's correct um due to
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest professional rules
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know we actually represent
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
through the council as a whole um the
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
council doesn't represent but we fund
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
the representation of several YDC
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
defendants so I believe there's one
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
defendant at the public defender and
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
then there's other uh who are
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
represented through different assigned
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
Council and I can tell you that last
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
time I looked it was about it was
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
getting close to about half a million
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
dollars per year that we had spent just
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
on those cases between attorneys and
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
services and that doesn't include
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
amounts that we would have spent funding
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
the public defender for their work on
 
01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
the case as
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
well do you ever fund the litigant in
 
01:51:14.109 --> 01:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
victims I mean represent them
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
or probably although it wouldn't be
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
directly it wouldn't be in the same
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
context but yes we since we provide
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire Legal
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
Assistant I'm sure that we would provide
 
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
services to those same individuals most
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
likely but not in the same way if that
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense no that doesn't make sense
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I apologize um so the only way I
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
would know specific people who we
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
represent is because we pay the bills on
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
specific dockets and specific defendants
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
so I could looking at those I can tell
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
you that yes that's a YDC claimant and
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me a YDC defendant um in terms of
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
repres presenting a victim um that those
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
Services wouldn't be provided through a
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
signed Council that would be something
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
where someone could be represented by
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone from Hamshire Legal
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
Assistance or
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise okay all right thank you
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ms then um I'm I'm not
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure I heard this correctly but I I I
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say um I think it
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
was on
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
um age8 where you're talking about the
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
bills and the number of the financial uh
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
process thing that you have to do yes
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
that um there was a um a desire or an
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
interest in having an additional uh body
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
to do that is that correct yes um I I
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any increase in your headcount
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
are you are you offsetting that
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
someplace else so I perhaps I'm wrong
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
but the only recommendation I there's no
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the in the governor's
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
budget for that extra person so I I've
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
asked for the funding but it's not in
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that was something
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
we asked for and our prioritized needs
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
budget didn't make into the governor's
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
recommended budget but I'm I'm back here
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
asking for it it was part of our LBA
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
audit and I I still think it's
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate um it was something that was
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out in our audit and I can can
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
say from firsthand experience that our
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
agency could certainly use more help and
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I think it would go a long
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
way not towards more efficient and
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
better processing but hopefully um
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
increasing some efficiencies in the way
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
we pay for
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
vendors so um you have on page four a
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
list of how many cases are opened a year
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
is this is a similar number closed is
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
the is the you
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
know relatively flat in terms of the
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing number of cases year to year
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
or it depends on the year so for example
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
during um 2020 2020 I think many more
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
cases were opened than closed there's a
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
real pause I think that number has been
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
evening out um but uh it depends on the
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
year quite frankly so in General is the
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
number of cases declining or increasing
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
the number of cases increasing for the
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
public defender I know I can't speak to
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
filings overall in the judicial system
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking the number of
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
cases that the public defender handles
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
is going up in the last since
 
01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
2020 okay is that because there's more
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
crime or there's more indigence or maybe
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
both I can't speak to that I can say
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that determine the
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
number of cases it could be crime could
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
be indigence and there's also um quite
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
frankly how long cases last and what
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
cases get charged so for example um if
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutors charge more types of crimes
 
01:54:37.069 --> 01:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
that raises the level of cases so it can
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
be um a lot of these cases there's
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial discretion a prosecutor in
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
a case can often bring one charge or
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
they could bring five and uh even if
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
those cases ultimately get disposed of
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
um it would still count as five cases
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
being opened or even if Char cases later
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
get dropped so a case is a charge not
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
defendant depending on General yes okay
 
01:55:05.229 --> 01:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
so of the say
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
6,352 felonies how many defendants were
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
there I I have to go back and look I
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
number and just just a little bit is it
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
a third is it a half is it a I'd say if
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
I was guess around 2/3 probably okay so
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
most people are just charged with one
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
charge most yes okay gotcha all right
 
01:55:31.069 --> 01:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
represent of
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
you um I'm trying
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
to reconcile in my mind the office of
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
the public defender plus you and and how
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
the revenues work what source of Revenue
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
does the office of the public defender
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
people virtually none um thank
 
01:55:58.750 --> 01:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
you but they're not listed in our book
 
01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.709 align:start position:0%
you but they're not listed in our book
right

01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
as that's a separate organization they
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
are they're listed as a 1094 that's
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
their budget line then so we pay um we
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
pay them on contract basis but we don't
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
see a 100 employees or something correct
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they're not employees they're
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're it's an independent organization
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay very good representative
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
leash thank you Mr chairman and just
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
another question for you Jay on page 511
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about or mentions legal
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
services and it's about $4.6 million
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
spent in 24 and yet what's being
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
requested under the governor's proposals
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
of flat $2 million and then I look to U
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
Legal Services over on page 514 again
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's very lopsided 300 3.2 million for
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
24 and a flat $2 million for 25 and 26
 
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.109 align:start position:0%
24 and a flat $2 million for 25 and 26
and

01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:54.119 --> 01:56:55.830 align:start position:0%
and
27

01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
so it appears at least to me based on
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
historic knowledge you're being
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
completely underfunded again is that
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
would that be a fair statement or not
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
putting you on the
 
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
spot I would anticipate we would have to
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
come back and seek additional funds
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the bium that's if the
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
funding goes forward as currently
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
proposed okay thanks what fraction of
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
cases are settled versus go to court V
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
90% representative e um recognizing that
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
our revenues are uh very low um I just
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
want to get back to you had you had a
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
chart here that
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
um it's I can't find it it's obviously
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
more expensive to be hiring contract
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys than it would be if you could
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
have some folks that you could hire you
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
high in terms of public defenders or
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry I mean there was the S
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
there was I guess what I'm paralleling
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
your situation to is what we see with
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and hospitals where they
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
have to keep hiring traveling nurses
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to just hire some
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
people here it is it's on page six and I
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess because my point is because
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
of your perpetual underfunding
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
you're actually ending up spending more
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
money than you would otherwise if we
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
would fund you appropriately and that's
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that's and then you have to keep
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
going back to the judicial Council that
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
is I mean the fiscal that I agree with
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
that and just going back to the public
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
defender versus assigned or contract
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
counsel if we don't have public
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
defenders um the situation that I see it
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
playing out currently quite frankly is
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
um if we have to close
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the judicial Council
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
um let me just back up even more we have
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
to pay and provide counil for people
 
01:58:59.470 --> 01:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
when it's constitutionally required we
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice and the courts can
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
directly appoint people as well and they
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
will because they they're entitled to
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
counsel um and absolutely as you say the
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
public defender is the most economical
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
means and it's not even close especially
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
when compared to assign Council and that
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
um because the assigned Council they're
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
paid hourly contract council is more
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
economical than assigned Council but we
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
just simply don't have enough contract
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
Council willing to accept cases on a
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
contract basis to make to increase the
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
number of contract Council the rates
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
would have to increase by a great deal
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
and that's something that is something
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy to discuss but um the
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
general point is that yes you paying for
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the public defender is simply like
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
paying in essence for wholesale for
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
Legal Services it's a much cheaper model
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
than paying you know hourly retail for
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
ass sign Council and because of this
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
state of underfunding as you say
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
basically we've had to rely more and
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
more on a signed Council which is much
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
more expensive right and because there's
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
a constitutional responsibility to
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
provide the council you don't really
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
have a choice as to whether the council
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
will be provided or not is that a
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
correct statement correct so either way
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
pay correct right I I don't mean that in
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
a mean way I'm just saying that it from
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
the Pennywise pound foolish standpoint
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it would be better to pay a
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
little more up front so we don't have to
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
pay a lot more
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
later yes all right thank you who
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
determines the um starting salary rates
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the public defending councils the
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
does and so the public defender does
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
within the realm of what they can
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
staff okay so if we added money to the
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
section it wouldn't necessarily raise
 
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
that that number it could go to
 
02:01:00.189 --> 02:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
more it would likely go towards both so
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
when the and I to provide a little
 
02:01:05.229 --> 02:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
context the council itself meets and
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
votes on the budget so the numbers you
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
see are a reflection of what the council
 
02:01:09.159 --> 02:01:10.790 align:start position:0%
see are a reflection of what the council
recommended

02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
02:01:14.069 --> 02:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
and the the numbers that we set forth
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
were intended to do two things one
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
increase Staffing but also increase
 
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
salaries um because both of those
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
factors are a play in the attrition that
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen why would a council prefer a
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
person prefer to be a public defender
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
rather than a contract councel the
 
02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:31.350 align:start position:0%
rather than a contract councel the
public

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
defender when it's operating at a
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
healthy in a healthy way has advantages
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
um it's more stable um you can you work
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
out of a certain geographic area there's
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
training there's you know you don't have
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
to there's benefits um there a lot of
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
the logistical aspects you don't have to
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
worry about the logistical aspects of
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
running a law firm contract attorneys
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know the money that we spend a lot
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
of that goes towards overhead for the
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
person to run their office so if you're
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
a if you're a similar to being a
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
prosecutor versus a private attorney you
 
02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't you're just focused on practicing
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
law and that's the advantage did I see a
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
hand over here representative L um thank
 
02:02:11.709 --> 02:02:11.719 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question just to
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on on what representative eil
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
was saying um presumably the only the
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
only reason it would make sense to under
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
hire or hire fewer attorneys than you
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
think you might need is if you think
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
somehow that the case loads are going to
 
02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
somehow that the case loads are going to
go

02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
down um have the case have case loads
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
gone down or are they pretty
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
consistently at the same level they've
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
been going up generally okay on a per
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
attorney basis and that so that would
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
then suggest that you know the the this
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
this the the smarter fiscal decision or
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
the more responsible fiscal decision
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
would be to to make sure that we hire up
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate level
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you well I'm going to call
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
this to a close even though this is a
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
complicated area and we may uh ask you
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
back or ask you questions
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
offline um but we probably shouldn't if
 
02:03:06.669 --> 02:03:06.679 align:start position:0%
the chief justice is here we shouldn't
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
leave them standing in the
 
02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
hallway so thank you very much for
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
coming thank you for the invitation I'm
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to provide any further
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.719 --> 02:04:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.629 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:05:13.629 --> 02:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:15.310 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:18.669 --> 02:05:18.679 align:start position:0%
so thank you for coming Mr chief justice
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
um I I'll just direct the committee um
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
the pages in house bill one start on 164
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
and end on
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
179 and I thought I would start on
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
179 because this is a kind of a bottom
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
so I guess this presentation looks
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
fairly similar to what we saw earlier is
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
that the it's it's got some of the S of
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
all good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
members that division one um it it has
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of the same content which we tried
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
to condense but it's focused really on
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
our budget presentation so let me start
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make more of a state a
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
statement and tell you what our problem
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
is and and let's look at page
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
179 right which is the bottom line of
 
02:06:31.119 --> 02:06:32.109 align:start position:0%
179 right which is the bottom line of
your

02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
um in this budget you spent in
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
2024 uh $112
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
million and you're scheduled to spend
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
for the next three years including the
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
current year more like 125 126
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
Etc um our problem is that um the
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget as a whole
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
overestimated General funds availability
 
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
by more than 10% Like between 10 and
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
11% and so um going up from
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
um from what's being spent now to by
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
this amount you know this is uh 13 12 13
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
14 million per per year
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
um is essentially an impossibility for
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
us we have to go down from this these
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
125 128 million kind of numbers by
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
something like
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
10% um
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
so two fiscal year 2024 it was just a
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
year ago so you know we could almost
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
just agree to be at that level going
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
forward and and call it a day but that's
 
02:07:57.199 --> 02:08:00.830 align:start position:0%
forward and and call it a day but that's
our

02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
problem if you see what I mean yeah any
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I I just so we're level
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
set on the same page you started at fy4
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
actual 104 is that yeah no no I have it
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
as well yeah so if you're looking at gen
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
General funds you're right right you're
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
right I was I was looking at the total
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
funds you're right General funds
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
104 um and then going to 120ish 119
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
120ish right so you're right just
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
general funds so if you could stay at
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
the one it's really 105 it's not 104 but
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it's 104.9 67 yeah so yeah that's
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
the level that we could do of General
 
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
funds now you know maybe we could do
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
tough well the way we we built our
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
budget was off of FY
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
25 adjusted
 
02:09:47.669 --> 02:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
authorized and that was
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
um on this just focusing on General
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
funds when
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
and our efficiency budget is at
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
118 um and uh
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I understand where you you have a
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
different starting point our starting
 
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
point was F FY 25 adjusted authorized
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
and we did go down from there and the
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
reduction there is uh
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
3.8% from from adjusted uh FY 25
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized to to our efficiency
 
02:10:20.199 --> 02:10:22.669 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized to to our efficiency
request

02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
so it looks to us like you're spending
 
02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.189 align:start position:0%
so it looks to us like you're spending
another

02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
15% compared to what you did ex a year
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
ago right in this current year so let me
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
let's let me just reorient the committee
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
to some facts about our budget we are
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
75% Personnel we are 92% General
 
02:10:49.709 --> 02:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
funds our Personnel that what's Driven
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
our increases and i a it Mr chairman has
 
02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
driven our increases are the following
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
things first two years ago I came to
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
this committee your counterparts in the
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
presented I presented the results of our
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
way to case load
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
study and this was a study conducted
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
over a period of year a year by a
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
national group The National Center for
 
02:11:22.549 --> 02:11:22.559 align:start position:0%
state courts and they concluded that we
 
02:11:24.549 --> 02:11:24.559 align:start position:0%
needed both additional judicial
 
02:11:27.629 --> 02:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
resources and additional staff resources
 
02:11:31.629 --> 02:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
in response the committee agreed to our
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation of seven additional
 
02:11:36.669 --> 02:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
circuit judges one additional Supreme uh
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judge and about
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
35 additional staff and that was based
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
on on this and um I do I do remember I
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
think chairman wer you
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
I remember this very clearly you were
 
02:11:55.709 --> 02:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
very appreciative that we had actual
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.109 --> 02:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
up Personnel are
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
expensive uh we had a 10% Coler so
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's Factor number one factor
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
number two 10%
 
02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
Cola then a 2%
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
Cola and those colas Drive our benefits
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
particularly judicial retirement they
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
drive the benefits
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
third Factor
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
benefits this year Dental's gone up
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
6% HMO
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
177% POS
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
32% so just for benefits in fiscal 26
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase factor
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
four uh the legislature um asked us to
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
take on the responsibility fiscal
 
02:12:52.549 --> 02:12:52.559 align:start position:0%
responsib ability of transferring
 
02:12:55.149 --> 02:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
prisoners it had previously been with
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
services and we absorbed those costs
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's about $800,000 a year so those are
 
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
the those are the primary factors that
 
02:13:09.549 --> 02:13:09.559 align:start position:0%
that that you're seeing that are driving
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
the U increase that you note Mr
 
02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
chairman that that those same Dynamics
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
create a problem for us because we are
 
02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:19.950 align:start position:0%
create a problem for us because we are
75%

02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
75%
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
personnel and and I've told the chair uh
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
privately and I'll tell you now we did
 
02:13:31.549 --> 02:13:31.559 align:start position:0%
our very very best to avoid any layoffs
 
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
system uh and that is that is how we
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
constructed our efficiency budget the
 
02:13:37.639 --> 02:13:41.950 align:start position:0%
constructed our efficiency budget the
bottom

02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
line uh let let me talk more
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
specifically of the points you just
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned so the 10% Cola would already
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
be in fiscal year 2024
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay so it's already in that
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
105 million but the 2% is not right the
 
02:14:04.189 --> 02:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
2% is later and obviously the benefits
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
costing more that's later and um and
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably you didn't hire these 43 new
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
people very much in 2024 right maybe you
 
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
got a few but not 20% 20% okay good
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
correct all right and now about
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
53% gotcha all
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
right um now we talked when you were
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
here earlier about if you had to cut you
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
would close certain uh cour houses and
 
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of stuff is that in the
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
governor's budget or
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
not uh the
 
02:14:46.549 --> 02:14:46.559 align:start position:0%
governor page nine this might be helpful
 
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
so our efficiency budget submission you
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
can see is the Top Line there 118 in the
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
first year 120 in the
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
2 uh the
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
governor's uh general fund Target is 116
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
milon 356 in the first
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
year and the same in the second
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
year the
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
Delta the Delta is um funds associated
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 318 which is the
 
02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
so-called bail
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
bill um and the cost associated with
 
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
that it's about $1.8
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
million of that about $1.2 million is
 
02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
the legislator's directive for the uh
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to pay bail
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the remainder is the
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of the magistrates their
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
them

02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so I think I saw that 1.8
 
02:16:13.549 --> 02:16:13.559 align:start position:0%
million somewhere in here
 
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:16.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
was it was like a new new
 
02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
was it was like a new new
thing

02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:37.389 align:start position:0%
um
174

02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.399 --> 02:16:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
17

02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
17
 
02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.349 align:start position:0%
17
yeah

02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
what's 174 no oh yeah right right right
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
right yeah page
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
174 those are the where those numbers
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
come from so they are in the governor's
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
um budget
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
here that's in our house bill one I
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
guess house yep right now um this this
 
02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
bought I think it was three um
 
02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
magistrates is that right correct by the
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
way uh representative eel has to leave
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
for an earlier appointment she's not
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
going to this is not being rude I know I
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
was just going to apologize I need no
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
disrespect when I jumped up in five
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm sorry yeah okay um so this
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
is three magistrates in this in this
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
budget here yes plus some related staff
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
I take it right no
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
ba they oh the bail commission
 
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
themselves the big chunk is about 1.2
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
million for bail commissioner payments
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha yeah but some of that is
 
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
offset by Revenue right so you're
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
collecting some yeah yeah I think we
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
build out we're just looking to see how
 
02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
it goes but I think we've paid out about
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
100,000 and we've collected back about
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
13,000 so 13%
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
okay and I just knowe Mr chairman this
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
is a new function for us and there are
 
02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:09.910 align:start position:0%
car costs associated with collecting the
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:12.270 align:start position:0%
car costs associated with collecting the
[Music]

02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
revenue yeah that brings up a question
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
um there's a
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
well no I guess this is not a question
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
for you I was thinking about there's a
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill to not collect from Indigent people
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
who use the um judicial Council Services
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
right because the cost of collection is
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
greater than the cost of uh uh what they
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
you know what they get is the same thing
 
02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
true here are you're spending more than
 
02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
13,000 to collect that I
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
mean it's difficult to quantify that
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
because we have existing staff who are
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
now doing but yes it is an additional
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
task that they are now asked to
 
02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
do okay great all right representative
 
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
Ms so on this this sorry thank you m uh
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chief justice for taking my question
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so on this this this bail reform line
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
item so we implemented a new a new
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
process of handling bail um that
 
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
presumably was baked into the FY 24 25
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
numbers correct I mean there is a
 
02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
process in place
 
02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
now there has been a place unless I'm
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
missing something the the
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that HB 318 was enacted
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
last year y okay the responsibilities
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
assigned to the judicial branch in that
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill are new oh okay so this is this is
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
this is that it's not what the governor
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
is hoping to do going forward as I
 
02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
understand she's she's seeking to change
 
02:19:53.550 --> 02:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
the actual substance of the bail I
 
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
you okay um let me ask about on page
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
non-federal what that all about that's
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
166 look at at class
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
73 grants
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
non-federal uh it's going from 2.9
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
Million actual to
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
4.4 so those those are grants associated
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the drug
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
court so you going to have more drug
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
court is that the idea okay sorry uh so
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2024 2.9 Million is what
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
we ended up actually paying out it's
 
02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to the drug cour programs
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
in our counties uh fiscal year 2025 is a
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
budget number so that is the full amount
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
of appropriation available to contract
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
out in Grants to the counties that's
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
very different from what we may end up
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the counties that's all
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here and with 26 and 27
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
based on what we believe we will pay out
 
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
not what you know what they may ask to
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
have contracted but what we will pay out
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
bit okay but you do so but you're
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
planning on a third more drug court or
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
something right because in
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursements compared to last year to
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
24 yes yeah
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay got representative Le
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do have a couple
 
02:22:27.389 --> 02:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
of questions and and look towards Donna
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
Raymond as a chief Finance person for
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
the court obviously there's a lot of
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
cost increased with House Bill 318 that
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice mentioned and the
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
magistrates there were five magistrates
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
or three three magistrates could you
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
point us uh on the budget where that
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes so it's on page
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
174 so kind of second half of the page
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at um where it says 010
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel yep those are the salaries for
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
the three magistrates there it is and
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
60 so obviously if I could further Mr
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
chairman obviously that's a significant
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
increase of almost $2 million a year to
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
your budget just to satisfy what we
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
tried to do with bail reform last year I
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
do have another concern if I could
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
continue Mr chairman go ahead it's um
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned with the
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
discussion we had when you were here
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
before about the possibility of closing
 
02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh especially the Claremont district
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
court or Circuit Court um Senator Bob
 
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
Odell and I back in the one of the worst
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh Economic Times back in 20 2009 went
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
across the state and tour the um the
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
courts that had been proposed by I think
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
chief justice broadrick to close and
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
there's our report which you'll find in
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
there it mentions specifically
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
Claremont and we heard from a number of
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
people City officials school officials
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
the place was packed about the closure
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the clar court and I now have heard
 
02:24:19.870 --> 02:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
from representative cluder who is a
 
02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
from representative cluder who is a
senior

02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
senior
 
02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
member of that community and I don't
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
know if claremont's still on your list
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
or if there's been any discussion about
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
closing clar further thank you uh for
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
the question representative uh there's
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
been further analysis of which cour
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
houses make the most sense to close and
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
we have adjusted that and it is in our
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
presentation um so page uh the
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
and from a savings perspective and
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
operational perspective and judge
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
Christo administrative judge of the
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court is here um we've concluded
 
02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense uh to close hookit
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
courts

02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay the other thing I'd like to add Mr
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the nine terms this being the ninth
 
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
term that I've sat on this
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
division we've always uh in I think good
 
02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
deference to the court uh accepted your
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget as it been brought forward and
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
because obviously you're a branch of
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
government you probably know better than
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of us how to run your branch of
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
government uh when you met with the
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
governor and she suggested 4% cut across
 
02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
the board was she aware of the impact it
 
02:25:54.269 --> 02:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
would have like closing courts or
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
reduction of services you mentioned
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
Security Services would be impacted
 
02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
which would entail not holding hearings
 
02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
because you didn't have hearings
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
officers so any of that discust or yeah
 
02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
just to
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
to set the table a little bit our
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget was based on guidance
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
from governor cunu and it was submitted
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
in September of 22 we so we just do the
 
02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
agency phase we don't do the governor's
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
phase so it was submitted as we
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
submitted it in September of uh end of
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
September of 2024 so our current
 
02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
governor um inherited if you will what
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
we had submitted um we in submitting
 
02:26:38.479 --> 02:26:39.269 align:start position:0%
we had submitted um we in submitting
that

02:26:39.269 --> 02:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
budget uh we were aware of the guidance
 
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
that the governor gave to executive
 
02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:44.510 align:start position:0%
that the governor gave to executive
branch

02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
agencies and uh just as it's been
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
practiced with for division one to pass
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
on the judicial branch budget the
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has always tried to be a
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
responsible partner in state government
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
and if the executive branch was asked to
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
make 4% Cuts we we felt obligated to
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
make our very best effort to do that and
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that is the efficiency budget you've
 
02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:10.349 align:start position:0%
so that is the efficiency budget you've
been

02:27:10.349 --> 02:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
presented we and and the impacts that we
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
described last time together are a
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
result of that efficiency budget we did
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
our very best to be faithful to what the
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
governor at the time was requesting and
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
minimizing the impact on our
 
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
operations I know representative obber
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
was never bashful to make
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations anyway I I guess I'm
 
02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
just concerned you know I heard earlier
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
from uh representative the good
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative from wantt Vernon on an
 
02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
issue uh we had before a fiscal today
 
02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
that Justice delayed is Justice denied
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
and I think SE said it well and another
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
case but the same thing to me exists
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
here that if you can't hold hearings
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
because you don't have security staff
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
how does that benefit the state as far
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
as getting feir Justice there's no
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%

governor's 2026 and 27 budget closing

2024 the
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
governor um traditionally just submits
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
our budget but is permitted to make uh
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
comment she did make a comment through
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that's the very second to
 
02:28:42.479 --> 02:28:43.510 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 that's the very second to
last

02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
slide um
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and she identified a bottom line
 
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
and she identified a bottom line
appropriation

02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
the and while we're on that I just want
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
to note for the record um that her
 
02:29:21.359 --> 02:29:24.030 align:start position:0%
to note for the record um that her
suggested

02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
adjustment should be
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
corrected and we have been in contact
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
with her office about this that it um we
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
were instructed last August that for
 
02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
were instructed last August that for
fiscal

02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
27 we did not need to include step
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
increases or health and
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
benefits um her number that you see here
 
02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
benefits um her number that you see here
in

02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 um
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
included those and they should be
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
deducted and that's the strike through
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
the strike through is ours and it
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
reflects that
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
deduction but all right but what I see
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
in house bill one if I add the two years
 
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
on page 175 Mr chair oh I'm sorry I'm on
 
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court my it's uh 238
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I see
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
238 I gotta okay
 
02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:40.910 align:start position:0%
238 I gotta okay
F

02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
238 looks like
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
7 yeah okay yeah yeah all right so 238.9
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
saying with these particular
 
02:30:55.720 --> 02:31:04.670 align:start position:0%
saying with these particular
cuts

02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
no the the difference between our Mr
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
nine the difference between our
 
02:31:21.870 --> 02:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
submission and her hers is the bail
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
million in both fiscal years M and then
 
02:31:32.450 --> 02:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
 
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:37.349 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
[Music]

02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
27 in fiscal
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
27 uh there's a Delta of 2.3 million
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
associated with step increase in health
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
and dental benefits that we were advised
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
to exclude and um and again we were
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
informed by The Bu by the governor's
 
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
office that she agrees with that so that
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
those are the
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
two major differences between what she
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:12.830 --> 02:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
submitted yeah my problem is we're still
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
to all right let's let me ask it this
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
way um you're adding 43 employees how
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
no so the chair Mr chairman your
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
question is before
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
we made the adjustments based on the way
 
02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
to case load study what was our head
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.120 --> 02:35:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
while we're looking for that I'll ask
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
another question so page seven says
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
there are more than 150,000 cases filed
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
every year how many of those um touch a
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
judge all of
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
them yes how how many of the
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
150,000 touch a judge
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
yes or do some of
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
them uh they settle and the judge never
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
sees it
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
or sure I I don't I don't think we have
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
those numbers at some point judicial
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
staff touch every single one of those
 
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
cases staff does Sure Staff does how
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
many actually resolve prior to a judge
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
seeing it I I don't think we have those
 
02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
numbers okay
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
um if I may just add in there actually
 
02:36:17.630 --> 02:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
even when it's resolved a judge still
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
has to review settlement agre so even if
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's result the judge still has to sign
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
off on may not go to trial hearing but a
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
judge still okay the reason I'm asking
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
this is so this makes it look like a
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
case costs
 
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:35.429 align:start position:0%
case costs
us

02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
um call it
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
$9,000 okay right 150,000 cases spending
 
02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:44.670 align:start position:0%
$9,000 okay right 150,000 cases spending
$120

02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
$120
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
million right oh I'm
 
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
sorry no no no $1,000
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
right okay n or $900 maybe for a case
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
well we've been looking at things like
 
02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:00.469 align:start position:0%
well we've been looking at things like
the

02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
btla okay and and they do for them it
 
02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
cost them like $10,000 a case it cost
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
you $1,000 a case right so why do we
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
have them you know what I
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
mean that's the the theory is we have
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
things we have btla habb this that and
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing because they're cheaper
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
or quicker or something compared to the
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
court but if the court can do a case for
 
02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:32.750 align:start position:0%
court but if the court can do a case for
$900

02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
$900
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
right none of them can do a case for
 
02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
$900 right do you have any any comment
 
02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
$900 right do you have any any comment
on

02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:37:44.429 --> 02:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
that do I have any comment on that we I
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
I can't comment on btla and their
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
operations I don't it's beyond my
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative wer yeah I I think
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
something I asked before but I didn't
 
02:37:56.990 --> 02:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
get an answer excuse me when was the
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
last time you increase the filing fees
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
and you know what was it and and you
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
know $10 or $20 for each case brings a
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
million2 million dollars more in that
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
takes care of a lot of
 
02:38:23.230 --> 02:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
so just uh for the record we
 
02:38:29.309 --> 02:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
we've submitted a report to the Ways and
 
02:38:29.319 --> 02:38:30.309 align:start position:0%
we've submitted a report to the Ways and
Means

02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
Means
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
Committee uh division one I believe
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's in your email I sent that out
 
02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:42.590 align:start position:0%
that's in your email I sent that out
yesterday

02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
excuse right last increase it depends on
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
the fee so that they've been caring at
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
varying points in time the fees have
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
been changed so we put in a table so you
 
02:38:56.590 --> 02:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
can see all of them good so what I'm
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
seeing is
 
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
seeing is
2013

02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
2013
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
um increased to
 
02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
225 up from 180 in
 
02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.510 align:start position:0%
225 up from 180 in
2009

02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
2009
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
and and this is this is for Supreme
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
Court so we did one for each court all
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
right that's for Supreme Court y circuit
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
this a circuit court 150 didn't say when
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
they were last increase they have two
 
02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
so that's I would propose it's time to
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
increase these filing fees by $20 which
 
02:39:34.990 --> 02:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
seems to take care of a lot of the costs
 
02:39:40.269 --> 02:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
about so wasn't the filing fee and
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
general maybe this just a civil case
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
$250 yes two there's 225 here for the
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court entry I'll let the judges
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
speak to it but the reality is there are
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
different fees for kind Cas and they've
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
been changed at varying times over the
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
past 20 years so the document that you
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
have will tell you every single and
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
presumably criminal cases have no fee
 
02:40:10.269 --> 02:40:10.279 align:start position:0%
right so is that right yes and and then
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
if folks are Indigent the fee may be
 
02:40:15.190 --> 02:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
waved in other cases so how many of the
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
out okay so there's over 100,000
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
criminal cases okay and as I understand
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
it a case is a crime not a defendant
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
right so the there there's fewer than
 
02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:53.309 align:start position:0%
right so the there there's fewer than
100,000

02:40:53.309 --> 02:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
100,000
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
defendants right because some defendant
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
might have done this that and the other
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
thing right is that right and and and
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
each one's a case yes I remember when we
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
were looking at the County
 
02:41:08.910 --> 02:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys every arrest was at least six
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
crimes I mean so now you're coming for
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
and and of course there's always the one
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
of U attempted to escape you know it
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
goes down at resisting arrest and almost
 
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
every one of them was resisting arrest
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
and and all this other thing and and and
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
we said to the to the county attorney
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
you have so many crimes but you don't
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
have that many criminals was an average
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
of about six a piece criminal so yeah
 
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
this this is what we're finding is that
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
correct is that yeah okay each one of
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
these has to be addressed okay we'll let
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
you off on these three but we got to
 
02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
charge you with those two you're going
 
02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:46.950 align:start position:0%
charge you with those two you're going
to

02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
jail you know but but wouldn't all six
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
be on one procedure in court yeah I
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't think so I think each one of them
 
02:41:56.590 --> 02:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
is a separate
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
charge so it looks like the case load is
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think this gentleman would like to
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
speak why don't you come on now I guess
 
02:42:06.870 --> 02:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
I shook my head too much yeah yeah so
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
Mark Howard chief judge of the Superior
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
Court yes so our case count is based on
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
docket numbers there might be multiple
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
charges in one docket number one
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
defendant might have multiple docket
 
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
numbers so each of those docket numbers
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
needs separate attention for the most
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
part for the superior Port it's about
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
70% of our case load that is
 
02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
dockets um is Criminal so there would be
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
no file in fso
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
schedule okay and just to make the point
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
we don't control what cases are filed
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
with us that's by the state account okay
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
or the charging yeah the arresting
 
02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
officer usually but they might file six
 
02:42:55.950 --> 02:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
different charges right and then plea
 
02:42:58.349 --> 02:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
bargain away several and you're guilty
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
of that one or something like that those
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
charges are in the same case you know
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's the same core conduct relating to
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
one case yes and then they might drop a
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
couple or plead out a couple that's I
 
02:43:13.389 --> 02:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
understand Goa okay make sure the
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
records clear on the criminal cases in
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court percentage is lower
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me Ellen Christo I'm the uh
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the Circuit
 
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
Court uh so we have approximately uh
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
about 55,000 of our
 
02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
131,000 cases a year are criminal cases
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
and again within that could be multiple
 
02:43:41.309 --> 02:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
chares all right so say that again
 
02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
55,000 55,000 we have approximately
 
02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
131,000 cases a year in all three of
 
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
visions and approximately 55,000 are
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
specifically criminal cases there are
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
the things that are associated with some
 
02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
criminal actions like warrants things
 
02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
like that but specific cases that are
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
brought it's
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
approxim okay and the rest are
 
02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:10.630 align:start position:0%
approxim okay and the rest are
violations

02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
violations
 
02:44:14.590 --> 02:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
or the rest would be uh small claes
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant uh parenting ought to
 
02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
probate stes trust divorces divorce um
 
02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect all so that would be all
 
02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
of our so criminal includes violations
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
and misdemeanors correct yes as well as
 
02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
um felonies because we get felonies um
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
at first instance so we do the felony
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
arraignments and probable cause hearings
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court before and if we
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
find probable C they get bound over to
 
02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
the security about half of them pay
 
02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:48.030 align:start position:0%
the security about half of them pay
filing

02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
filing
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
fees that I would have to I in terms of
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
the criminal cases no not obviously the
 
02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
criminal cases don't I I would have to
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
get those numbers I I don't have an idea
 
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head how many actions
 
02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:02.070 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head how many actions
they

02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
filing because if if we haven't
 
02:45:07.950 --> 02:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
increased the filing fees since 2013 and
 
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
most of the ones I'm looking at that
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
would seem ripe or an adjustment with
 
02:45:16.110 --> 02:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
all the inflations we've had since 2013
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anybody can argue with
 
02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:19.630 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anybody can argue with
it

02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
if we made a substantial increase in
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
those and it would take off some of the
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
burden we're worrying about paying for
 
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
the courts I remember back
 
02:45:33.309 --> 02:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
in 30 years ago lower courts supported
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
themselves on fines and
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
fees and I think at the time lower
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
courts were 16
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
million and we decided to go
 
02:45:48.429 --> 02:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
with paying for them under under General
 
02:45:48.439 --> 02:45:50.190 align:start position:0%
with paying for them under under General
funds

02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
later we were up to 40,000 then we're
 
02:45:58.349 --> 02:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
still only getting like 20,000 in fines
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
and fees because nobody had bothered to
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
oh it's not our money who cares right so
 
02:46:07.230 --> 02:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to kind of pay for
 
02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
the services to some degree and I don't
 
02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
think anybody can argue with that did
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
you come up with a total number of
 
02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
employees yeah so in the 2627 budget
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
there are 726 full-time equivalent uh
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
clerical so non-judicial
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
staff that will include some of the
 
02:46:31.230 --> 02:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
additional positions for which we
 
02:46:33.790 --> 02:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
received funding in 2425 not all of them
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we did unfund some of the
 
02:46:39.309 --> 02:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
positions to meet the governor sununu's
 
02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
Target okay that's all non-judicial
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct and the judges are uh the
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
judges we're we're fully
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
staffed for judges less than 100 77
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
fulltime judges one part time and
 
02:46:56.399 --> 02:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
fulltime judges one part time and
some

02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
77 all right so when you added 35 more
 
02:47:08.469 --> 02:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
staff due to what we did last year last
 
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
time that was only a 5%
 
02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:14.429 align:start position:0%
time that was only a 5%
increase

02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:47:14.439 --> 02:47:16.950 align:start position:0%
increase
yeah

02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:47:20.510 --> 02:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay um so there was a 5% increase in
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
staff there was a there was a 2%
 
02:47:29.389 --> 02:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
increase in salaries and there was a um
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
some percent increase in
 
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
benefits but I guess I'm still having a
 
02:47:38.110 --> 02:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the 15% what what is the total
 
02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:46.710 align:start position:0%
to the 15% what what is the total
increase

02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
here yeah
 
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
16% maybe not quite
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:18.429 --> 02:48:18.439 align:start position:0%
right other questions yes represent one
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I I just like to
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
try to understand you know what the
 
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
total numbers are I'd just like to try
 
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
to understand what the total numbers are
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
I mean if I if I am reading the the
 
02:48:38.150 --> 02:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
budget um book that we received on page
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
179 it shows that for FY
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
2026 the governor is recommending a
 
02:48:46.830 --> 02:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
total budget for the for the judicial
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
at and and I guess what I'm trying to
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
understand is is that the number that
 
02:49:06.110 --> 02:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
you think your budget is for that year
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
or are you believing that it's a higher
 
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
a higher or lower
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
number well um the there's an adjustment
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the the line that says
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
judicial branch 128 million 2459 you see
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
that yeah and then there's a deduction
 
02:49:22.670 --> 02:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
basically the 2,
 
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
65769 yeah that our budget is 128
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
245974 but it that
 
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
2,657 is transfers from other agencies
 
02:49:33.469 --> 02:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
so they're trying not to double count
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
them so because if you said oh I'm G to
 
02:49:37.229 --> 02:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
give you a million you know agency I'm
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
agency a I'm gonna give be a million
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
dollars I have it in my budget of a
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
million they have it in their budget for
 
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
a million double count so but but you're
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're in agreement that your bud
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for what you what you
 
02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
asked for was 128 245
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
974 mhm in total not General funds it's
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
total total
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
funds the general fund component of that
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
is the 118
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
18652 which includes bail reform money
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
you deduct the bail reform money you get
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
to Governor's
 
02:50:14.910 --> 02:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
Target well the bail reform money is
 
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
included in that that's correct that's
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
why I say if you back out the reform
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
money from the18 million because it's
 
02:50:23.229 --> 02:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
all general fund money okay we met
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu's Target that he gave us
 
02:50:28.830 --> 02:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay and then just to come back to
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
something else we were talking about
 
02:50:34.229 --> 02:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
earlier that $128 Million number for FY
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
26 does that include any of the savings
 
02:50:40.190 --> 02:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
associated with goof closing goof toown
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
and hookit not goof toown and hookit
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
Candia and
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
Claremont okay so this reflects this was
 
02:50:50.349 --> 02:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
still Candia and Claremont
 
02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay and you should see that reflected
 
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
in um accounting unit 1880 class 28 so
 
02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's on page 166 of your budget that
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
property okay it's built into those
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that we receive from Bureau of
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
Court facilities okay and then that
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
number does not include I I was jumping
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
ahead a little bit in your presentation
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
there were a number of um prioritized
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
budget needs that does not that number
 
02:51:27.630 --> 02:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
does not include any of those things
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
correct such as and we talked quite a
 
02:51:31.469 --> 02:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
bit the last time you were here about
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
security so there's there was a you know
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
there was a a wish list I guess of about
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
$900,000 for security that's not in here
 
02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:42.790 align:start position:0%
$900,000 for security that's not in here
correct

02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Ms can I
 
02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
just add something to that I do want to
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
note just um because you are new to the
 
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee there is an additional um as
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
chief justice pointed out there is an
 
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
additional footnote in the back of your
 
02:51:57.630 --> 02:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
budget book where the governor makes an
 
02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
additional uh reduction of $6 million
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
over the banum to General funds that is
 
02:52:05.389 --> 02:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
not reflected in the total numbers that
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
you just discussed $6 million for the
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
judicial branch over the banum in
 
02:52:12.030 --> 02:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
general funds footnotes will get you
 
02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:13.910 align:start position:0%
general funds footnotes will get you
every

02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:16.469 align:start position:0%
every
time

02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question yes
 
02:52:22.429 --> 02:52:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative wer so some previous
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
times we were reviewing the court
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
system we discovered there were several
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
circuit courts that were staffed five
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
days a week and judges were there only
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
exist it does in h in are two of those
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
places those are the ones we're closing
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
those are how many more can we close
 
02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking to consolidate into other
 
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh cour houses such as Candia that is
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
also that same thing so that way it
 
02:52:54.990 --> 02:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
would be fully staffed all the time so
 
02:52:57.469 --> 02:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
we were looking for those efficiencies
 
02:52:59.309 --> 02:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
those those were the only two that were
 
02:52:59.319 --> 02:53:02.309 align:start position:0%
those those were the only two that were
likely

02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
last that is a more complicated question
 
02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
because there are other places for
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
instance in the North country that have
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
some of those issues but they
 
02:53:12.510 --> 02:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
geographically really can't consolidate
 
02:53:16.750 --> 02:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
with another Court Courthouse um so but
 
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
these are the two that that look best
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
candidates for that and actually uh
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
provided an additional uh approximately
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
$42,000 a year in savings over Candia
 
02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
Claremont combination no I I remember
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
when we um closed the one in plasta that
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
was that kind of court and you know I
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
thought oh we'll sell the building and
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
make money no it became I think the town
 
02:53:43.469 --> 02:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
owned it so it became a library or
 
02:53:46.110 --> 02:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
something but are a lot of them like
 
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
that that were renting it yeah I almost
 
02:53:51.389 --> 02:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
about half and half that we own or or
 
02:53:53.309 --> 02:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
lease and the two that we're proposing
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
are both leased uh buildings now we save
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
lease payments so that's good thank you
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
we have a bill to get rid of Family
 
02:54:04.429 --> 02:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
Court then replace with mediators is
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
there Savings in that or not
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak as to the policy of the
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
bill but certainly I don't believe
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's any savings uh we already send
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
every case uh to mediation through the
 
02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:20.469 align:start position:0%
every case uh to mediation through the
court

02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
so I can't imagine that there would be
 
02:54:24.670 --> 02:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
Savings in it but I can't speak to the
 
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
specifics of that bill so so family
 
02:54:30.030 --> 02:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
court is just a subset of circuit court
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
right it's a division yes it's one of
 
02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
the division one of the three divisions
 
02:54:36.429 --> 02:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
of the circuit are there judges assigned
 
02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:38.279 align:start position:0%
just to that no they're all cross
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
trained everybody's cross trained and so
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
intended to be we're sort of general
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
practitioners and and how many there's
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
40 something 49 49 Superior Court 49
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
circuit 23 Superior say that again 49
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
circuit 23 Superior 23 okay and we've
 
02:55:02.309 --> 02:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
got drug courts and Veterans courts and
 
02:55:02.319 --> 02:55:04.830 align:start position:0%
got drug courts and Veterans courts and
what

02:55:04.830 --> 02:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:07.349 --> 02:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
else drug courts veterans courts is
 
02:55:09.389 --> 02:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
there any other special courts mental
 
02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
courts those all using the same cour
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
houses as the circuit courts and the
 
02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:19.389 align:start position:0%
houses as the circuit courts and the
general

02:55:19.389 --> 02:55:19.399 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
courts

02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
courts
 
02:55:24.479 --> 02:55:26.950 align:start position:0%
courts
okay

02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:35.070 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:55:35.070 --> 02:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.630 --> 02:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
right all right so a question for the
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
chair I just kind of curious represent
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
LE U I'm just kind of curious you were
 
02:55:50.910 --> 02:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
very much involved with the bail reform
 
02:55:52.870 --> 02:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
as the whole division was last year
 
02:55:56.429 --> 02:55:56.439 align:start position:0%
you're gut feeling with these proposed
 
02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
suggested cuts by the governor how it
 
02:56:00.750 --> 02:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
might impact the work we did last year
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
for instance on bail
 
02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
reform I'm sure you have a
 
02:56:09.150 --> 02:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
thought yeah well I was going to ask
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
about um magistrates so despite the you
 
02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
recent case that made the newspapers
 
02:56:21.790 --> 02:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
um we generally had the idea that that
 
02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
magistrates were a good idea because
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're a lot less expensive than um
 
02:56:29.550 --> 02:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
than judges and
 
02:56:33.150 --> 02:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
so um would it make sense to have even
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
more magistrates and fewer judges would
 
02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
money think I guess you were creating
 
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
positions going forward the answer to
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
that would be yes it clearly magistrates
 
02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
cost less than judges do um magistrates
 
02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
can't do all of the same things that
 
02:57:00.269 --> 02:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
judges do so there's certain constraints
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
in their uh in what they can do um but I
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't think you could lay off judges
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
because judges are
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
appointed um so there's certainly not no
 
02:57:13.229 --> 02:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
Savings in that but certainly going
 
02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
forward if there were additional
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
positions created that would be right
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
and can a magistrate handle a complete
 
02:57:24.750 --> 02:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
case or do they have to do something and
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
then it gets handed off to a judge so uh
 
02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
in magistrates handle the initial uh
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
items in a criminal case so for instance
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
they do bail hearings they can do
 
02:57:40.229 --> 02:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
arraignments uh and they can do probable
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
cause hearings so all the preliminary
 
02:57:45.429 --> 02:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
matters in a criminal case they can also
 
02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh make determinations on warrants
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
things like that um and so we're using
 
02:57:54.229 --> 02:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
them in our court houses now to to give
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
back judge time so that judges can do
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
other other work um but right now under
 
02:58:01.630 --> 02:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
the administrative order that is all
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
that they are authorized to do by both
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the and the
 
02:58:09.309 --> 02:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
administrative so it's a subset and only
 
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
the preliminary and only
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
criminal so would it be impossible for
 
02:58:16.830 --> 02:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
them to do parking tickets and speeding
 
02:58:18.590 --> 02:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
tickets and all those those kind of
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
things right now the way the law is yes
 
02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible the law would
 
02:58:25.229 --> 02:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
have to change in order for that to
 
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:32.110 --> 02:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
law that's what I'm here for right I
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
mean it's so okay I see all right thank
 
02:58:35.319 --> 02:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
mean it's so okay I see all right thank
you

02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:58:39.870 --> 02:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
um other questions all right well we've
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
we've had you for an hour and I think
 
02:58:46.349 --> 02:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
that's probably all I should take um
 
02:58:48.389 --> 02:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated area and like I
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
said we we are not very close as far as
 
02:58:54.229 --> 02:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell um between what we need and
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
and what we've got in the book now so um
 
02:58:58.269 --> 02:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
we are going
 
02:59:03.429 --> 02:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
to talk study more and and uh
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
maybe offline talk some more I guess I I
 
02:59:08.670 --> 02:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
don't really want to take up your time
 
02:59:12.910 --> 02:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to process 150,000
 
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
cases you know so well if I could just
 
02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
respond of the chair's first question
 
02:59:24.070 --> 02:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
be devastating yeah it would be um I
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
mean you did it last year right so it's
 
02:59:34.910 --> 02:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
we

02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:59:39.229 --> 02:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it it'd be hard to get to that
 
02:59:44.110 --> 02:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:47.429 --> 02:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
had and if I may as well to put fiscal
 
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
year 20 25 into perspective um there is
 
02:59:54.510 --> 02:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
a 5.3% lapse expected we're looking to
 
02:59:56.910 --> 02:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
meet that so we're looking to lapse
 
02:59:59.910 --> 02:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
about $7.5 million in general fund so I
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
would take
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
the uhuh okay yeah so I would take the
 
03:00:06.910 --> 03:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
121 you can reduce it by 7.5 but that's
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
a fairly accurate um estimation of what
 
03:00:13.630 --> 03:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
we are going to spend with what we have
 
03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
now okay I see yeah I always think about
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
point uh about 7.5
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
million we will lapse back in general
 
03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
funds okay so you expect fiscal year 25
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
to meet that lapse correct that's
 
03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay and we're making up a
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
significant shareff reimbursement
 
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
shortfall with that as well still
 
03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:52.910 --> 03:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we should start budgeting you know
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
real numbers instead of numbers plus
 
03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:00.710 align:start position:0%
real numbers instead of numbers plus
laps

03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.830 --> 03:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
right it just seems like it adds
 
03:01:11.190 --> 03:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
know the death row
 
03:01:17.070 --> 03:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
jeans people on death row had been
 
03:01:30.990 --> 03:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
selling okay thank you all right all
 
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
well if if we can uh obviously as the
 
03:01:40.190 --> 03:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee goes on we're here to provide
 
03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
more information and help you come to
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
the best decision possible under the
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so please yeah please
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
reach out yeah it's just you know we
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
have what we have that's the problem and
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and we are in a
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
recession that's the other problem all
 
03:01:59.670 --> 03:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much Mr chief chief
 
03:02:02.670 --> 03:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative mire representative mire
 
03:02:04.590 --> 03:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
yes hi yes I'm Nina Gardner and I'm the
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
chairman of the judicial Council I want
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure you got word of the error
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
that was in the judicial Council budget
 
03:02:12.990 --> 03:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
oh the governor's office um indicated
 
03:02:15.229 --> 03:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
there is a a discrepancy between what
 
03:02:16.830 --> 03:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
they told us and what was put in the
 
03:02:19.389 --> 03:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
budget I have dou umentation of that
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's very much more helpful in some
 
03:02:24.229 --> 03:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
senses to us maybe not to you but it
 
03:02:26.830 --> 03:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
does raise our budget from 39 M from 37
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
to 39 million the governor had intended
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
that to be in our budget we are
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to we need that 39
 
03:02:36.389 --> 03:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
million probably in 10 more but I want
 
03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure you got communication they
 
03:02:42.349 --> 03:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
said they were let me this give it to
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
get yes
 
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's I want to make sure you
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
got it I think J mention presentation
 
03:02:58.550 --> 03:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's terribly important to our budget
