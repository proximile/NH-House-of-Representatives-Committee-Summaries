00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:36.260 align:start position:0%
good morning guys
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh so we rounded everybody up got
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
everybody here that's good
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so we are looking at HB 71 so I'd
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
like to call the work session uh to
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
order and um we had we heard quite a bit
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
of testimony on uh the spell yesterday
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
which I found helpful
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
um just as a reminder there are two
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
components to it uh part one which
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
increases the primathacia presumption of
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
cancer disease and firefighters to all
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of cancer
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
and then the second to set up a
 
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.060 align:start position:0%
commission to study the implementation
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
of optional annual cancer screenings
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
um I'll start the conversation this
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
morning by just saying I've had
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
a few conversations since yesterday
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
particularly about this study commission
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
and there is some concern
 
00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:28.670 align:start position:0%
and there is some concern
um

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the fact that we're going to need
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
to find eight legislators to serve on
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
that and how effective the commission
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
will be if we have to have that many of
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
us on there and not other experts and it
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
should be studied but is it better left
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
studied to other groups of people
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just throw that out there and
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
then allow conversation to ensue Peter
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
which thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
first of all my apologize apologies to
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
everyone uh I somehow when I was in the
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps many many years ago decades
 
00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:05.530 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps many many years ago decades
ago

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.540 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
the whole company would be out there
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
falling out for inspection
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the whole company there will
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
all be a couple of people staggering out
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
of the Barrack store going like what's
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
going on oh we're here out for
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
inspection oh I didn't get the word well
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
I didn't get the word either about
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
yesterday so I wasn't here my apologies
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
but I do have a question and that is uh
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
remind me again that you mentioned eight
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature on this study
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
committee how many of them are proposed
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
to be from the Senate two two
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
so typically as as some of us have
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
experienced in the past the Senate looks
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
at any number that's not one and says
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to convert two or three into
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
one Senator because they don't have the
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
troops to to have a full contingent that
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the house will or the sponsor will set
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
up so uh but this is it everyone else's
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
opinion that that uh six legislature six
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
house members seems like a lot
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
it is it's a lot and the concern is that
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's just not really going to happen
 
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:24.500 align:start position:0%
um exactly because
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's questioning
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
the importance of the study itself or
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't need the information and I
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
understand yeah I understand why they
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
want to do it and I'm actually somewhat
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
in support of why they want to do it
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
um it's just a matter of whether or not
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative responsibility or
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
if there is a better Avenue to do that
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
um is there any is there any thought
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
among the subcommittee that we should
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps reduce the number of of house
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
members from six to three the typical
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
number of house members that are on the
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
study committee so it's not a committee
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's a commission well and so the well
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is is according to statute
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
we need to be in the majority on the
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
committee and so to get the set the
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
seven other people that we that they
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
would like on it to get you know the
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
um kind of breadth of
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
representation that they want we'd have
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
to have eight eight legislators if we
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
reduce us we'll have to reduce them as
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
well and then you really start running
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
into do you have the people on it that
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
you need I take your point entirely
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
um so that that's one section that I'm I
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
would like to personally I would like to
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
see section one go through regardless I
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
I think it's reasonable
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
um which is the Primus Prima fascia
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
presumption that cancer disease
 
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:48.290 align:start position:0%
presumption that cancer disease
um

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
is is caused by the occupational hazard
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I was I'm pretty much okay with that
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
I don't know what other people's
 
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
feelings on it
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
press yeah I'm expecting you to say
 
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.269 align:start position:0%
press yeah I'm expecting you to say
something

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:06.889 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
the commission aside and now we're
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
talking about section one yes
 
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.110 align:start position:0%
talking about section one yes
um

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
ruminating over it last night
 
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
ruminating over it last night
um

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
and some of the tests and trying to
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
compare that with some of the testimony
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
oddly enough I still do have a problem
 
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.470 align:start position:0%
oddly enough I still do have a problem
with

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
it shall just be assumed that all
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
cancers in the world
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
will be workman's comp related
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
so once again for clarification on that
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
because I I don't think that's quite the
 
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.410 align:start position:0%
because I I don't think that's quite the
position

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
if it's reasonable when all of the other
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
considerations are taken into account of
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
Life habits and all of the other things
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
that they take into consideration
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the evidence doesn't strongly point
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
one way or the other and it's in those
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
finely defined cases where they're not
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know it could go it could be
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
occupational it could not be
 
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
occupational it could not be
occupational

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
occupational
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
the presumption is just that it's in
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
favor of the firefighter and not in the
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
favor of the insurance company
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
essentially the workman's comp company
 
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.530 align:start position:0%
essentially the workman's comp company
so

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's not open it's open to any form
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
of cancer but you would still have to
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
make a good case about how that would be
 
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.970 align:start position:0%
make a good case about how that would be
related

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Gerhard thank you
 
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
chairman the only thing I'm concerned
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
about is
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
kind of creating a moral hazard
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
situation where the government's
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the effect of using
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing materials if there was
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
actually a cost associated with using
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
these which is really people's lives
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
instead of just paying them basically
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
blood money to use this stuff wouldn't
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
it kind of be
 
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
important to encourage the creation of
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
something else do you know what I'm
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
trying to get at does that make any
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
sense so that's it that's what I'm kind
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
of dealing with I think I think that
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees with you and there's
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
been a lot of conversation about that
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
obviously we're learning new things and
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we need to come up with new Solutions
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we didn't realize that we're
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing outfits now we're now
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
we're starting to question whether they
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
are they seem to be
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and so we're limiting the use of them
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a solution to that
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
problem and we can't come up with a
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem like today so
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
knowing that we've put them in this
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
position I guess the question is what's
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do knowing that we've
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
put them in this position because uh you
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
know they've been they've been wearing
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
these suits right along and so
 
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.789 align:start position:0%
these suits right along and so
um

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
if they're causing people to have more
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
kinds of cancer
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
those things will are going to pop up
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
and how do we handle the fact that
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're popping up you know like we
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
can't retroactively keep them from
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
wearing the suits understood but what's
 
00:18:57.419 --> 00:18:58.549 align:start position:0%
wearing the suits understood but what's
to

00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
keep this from happening in the future
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
in a sense there's just the hope that
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
eventually somebody say okay I feel bad
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
about the situation occurring I'm going
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
to change or do you know what I'm trying
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
to get at that's what I'm just sure so
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I I think the only
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
information that we have on that is that
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
they are trying to minimize the amount
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
that they're wearing the suits for
 
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
example they do have they do go into
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
detox when they get back
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
um which didn't used to be the case
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
um I would assume that we as legislators
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
have potentially a responsibility to
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
look into it and maybe take action in
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
the future but once again
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not sure that that directly
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
overlaps with whether or not we give
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
them the presumption of cancer now we
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
can always take away the presumption of
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
cancer later if enough that's been
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
mitigated but I doubt that would happen
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
um but you know that's I think that's
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
what we're given consideration to
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
Peter

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
Peter
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so I mean uh we several years
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
ago uh
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
we had a bill about these firefighting
 
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.430 align:start position:0%
we had a bill about these firefighting
foams

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
foams
 
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:10.700 align:start position:0%
which were standard in especially in
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
aviation related fires
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
which are of a very different nature in
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
many cases than the standard building
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
fire and it was discovered that these
 
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.100 align:start position:0%
Foams were
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
loaded with
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh one of the P5 P5 type chemicals uh
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime that particular
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
type of foam has been done away with uh
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and it's they still have some
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams but they are much
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
less uh laced with very dangerous
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals and it and we were told at the
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
time that one of the graduation
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
uh celebrations for firefighters
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
finishing their training was to get
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
doused with uh that that that's a
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
chemical the firefighting foam uh and
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
even that sometimes in the schools they
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
would be playing the kids would play
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
around with the stuff uh and were
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe there are other things
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
that that are cancer-causing that are
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
fun I've not done any experimentation
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
nor do I intend to but but the thing is
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of money there was a lot
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
of money that was spent in
 
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
um in developing new
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams now most fire
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
departments do not
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
use that stuff because it's primarily
 
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:49.580 align:start position:0%
designed for Aviation
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
fires which are you know you're dealing
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
with lots and lots of uh jet fuel
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
which is very flammable and very
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
dangerous and there's a lot of it so
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
that you need that kind you need some
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
kind of foam to fight them effectively
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
so in this particular instance if we're
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
if these guys are suited up in in
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
outfits which they need to survive
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
in that particular instance
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
you can't walk in without being fully
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
suited up
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
and having
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
breathing apparatus all that other kind
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
of stuff so to the degree that they have
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
to wear that or they're going to die on
 
00:22:32.409 --> 00:22:32.419 align:start position:0%
the spot in that fire then we are
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
expecting them to do something which is
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
extremely hazardous and which almost
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
certainly will produce some kind of
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
negative effect
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
later on I I think
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
if you're going to pay the price you get
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the dance so I I'm that's not
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
going to deter me from supporting uh
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
this you know this
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
expansion or extension of the coverage
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay I will I will yes oh sorry go ahead
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative and I I apologize I
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
apologize to the subcommittee but not at
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
all here I go again
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
um and and I I discussed this not in uh
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
I realized that in testimony we heard
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the cost of this
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be minimal
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
because there won't be that many cases
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
of of cancer coming in to workman's comp
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
new cases that's going to drive the cost
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
but that's just a guess nobody knows
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
what's what it's going to cost
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh or if it would be inconsequential or
 
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
uh or if it would be inconsequential or
substantial

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's just not known
 
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.450 align:start position:0%
it's just not known
hmm

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
but saying that
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
it is just assumed that any cancer that
 
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.909 align:start position:0%
it is just assumed that any cancer that
cancer

00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
will be work related
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
as as it states
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
in addition to the ones that are already
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
that we got in the handout listed as
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
these uh work these are workman's comp
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
and we were given uh uh the uh the uh
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
example of I think it was testicular
 
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.310 align:start position:0%
example of I think it was testicular
cancer

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
where that's not covered
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
I I don't remember if it was not proven
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
that it was work related or it was
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
disproven that it was it was disproven
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I believe correct
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
I was just asking for clarification
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
Mr will is in the backseating
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm good at the moment yeah I just
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.909 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
if we pass section one
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
that testicular cancer would be presumed
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
to be work related
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
right uh just for clarification Mr role
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
was is testicular cancer on the list or
 
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's not yes
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
so it would have been presumed it would
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
have been presumed to be work related it
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
was found not to be work related so they
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
denied the claim
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that this was a situation where that
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
is on the list testicular cancer is
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
presumed to be work related unless
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise proven and they proved that it
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't that was the point of that part
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
of the testimony I believe to show that
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
just because it's presumed doesn't mean
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
that they'll get the
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
that they'll get the claim but we'll
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
all right uh section two sorry this is a
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
little tricky because we're basically
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with two different bills in the
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
same bill and we're gonna have to sort
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
that out
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
yes I got
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
today I like it you're you're hopping we
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
get about 15 minutes here before we got
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
to be out of the room just so everybody
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
knows maybe 20.
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason why
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
this information could not be gotten
 
00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:32.149 align:start position:0%
this information could not be gotten
without

00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
um needed information
 
00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
um needed information
uh

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
people can get together and get that
 
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.210 align:start position:0%
people can get together and get that
information

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh compiled I I just think a
 
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
a commission is not needed
 
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.950 align:start position:0%
a commission is not needed
yes

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
I think I mentioned the other day we
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
were talking about this the Wi-Fi and
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
cellular radiation commission that was
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
conducted in 2020
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
they put out a report said this stuff is
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
really bad we need 1500 foot setbacks
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
and nothing's ever happened since so I
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't really know if you need
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
Representatives on a situate on a board
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
like that just to have nothing happen
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
there's the the people who know
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the material already know the material
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
and it's simply a matter of presentation
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
I think that's the whole concept so
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't really see the benefit
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
unless we can guarantee that something
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually will occur upon the execution
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
of the Commission
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.409 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
um so I have an amendment uh
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the commission side cleaning up the
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
language to what it needed to be
 
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.909 align:start position:0%
language to what it needed to be
um

00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
if we decide to to move forward with
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
section two it doesn't sound like most
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee is in favor of that
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
um from what people have said but in
 
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
case that is the case we had to change
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
the effective date we needed to change
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
slightly the um composition of the
 
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.370 align:start position:0%
slightly the um composition of the
commission

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.570 align:start position:0%
commission
um

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
so I do have an amendment that fixes
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
that language
 
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.029 align:start position:0%
that language
um

00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
if we do decide to go in that direction
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
I guess at this point having listened to
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
what everyone has to say I would make
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
the motion I'll have to get an amendment
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
before our exact session if we were
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
going to do this but I would make a a
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
motion to keep part one
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the bill and strike the commission
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
strike part two out of the bill and try
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
to come up with a separate solution to
 
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.610 align:start position:0%
to come up with a separate solution to
that

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
that would that would be more
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
I have a second all right
 
00:28:42.299 --> 00:28:43.730 align:start position:0%
I have a second all right
um

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll just call the role representative
 
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:56.830 align:start position:0%
I'll just call the role representative
Schmidt

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.289 --> 00:28:59.299 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
representative yeah you've got until
 
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580 align:start position:0%
this afternoon representative Schmidt
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I suppose what you were just saying
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
about passing the first part and
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
strike in a second yeah all right
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
so I got 4-0 on that I'll bring that
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
we'll bring that then to the executive
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon and see how
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
everybody else feels about it
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
so I have the amendment so if the full
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
exec session if the full committee
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
decides that they want to keep the
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
commission I have the language to I have
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
clean up that language so we can bring
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
that Amendment forward at that time just
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
so that it's all in order in case it
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
goes forward so
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
all right you got a half an hour we'll
