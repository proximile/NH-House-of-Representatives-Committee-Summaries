00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we need to come up with new Solutions
 

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
so we need to come up with new Solutions
so<00:18:14.640><c> we</c><00:18:14.760><c> didn't</c><00:18:14.940><c> realize</c><00:18:15.179><c> that</c><00:18:15.419><c> we're</c>

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we didn't realize that we're
 

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.830 align:start position:0%
so we didn't realize that we're
cancer-causing<00:18:16.440><c> outfits</c><00:18:17.340><c> now</c><00:18:18.240><c> we're</c><00:18:18.480><c> now</c>

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing outfits now we're now
 

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.029 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing outfits now we're now
we're<00:18:18.960><c> starting</c><00:18:19.140><c> to</c><00:18:19.260><c> question</c><00:18:19.440><c> whether</c><00:18:19.799><c> they</c>

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
we're starting to question whether they
 

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.650 align:start position:0%
we're starting to question whether they
are<00:18:20.220><c> they</c><00:18:20.580><c> seem</c><00:18:20.820><c> to</c><00:18:20.940><c> be</c>

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
are they seem to be
 

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.090 align:start position:0%
are they seem to be
um<00:18:21.720><c> and</c><00:18:21.960><c> so</c><00:18:22.020><c> we're</c><00:18:22.200><c> limiting</c><00:18:22.620><c> the</c><00:18:22.679><c> use</c><00:18:22.860><c> of</c><00:18:22.980><c> them</c>

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and so we're limiting the use of them
 

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.490 align:start position:0%
um and so we're limiting the use of them
but<00:18:23.340><c> we</c><00:18:23.460><c> don't</c><00:18:23.580><c> have</c><00:18:23.880><c> a</c><00:18:24.539><c> solution</c><00:18:25.080><c> to</c><00:18:25.380><c> that</c>

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a solution to that
 

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.810 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a solution to that
problem<00:18:25.679><c> and</c><00:18:25.919><c> we</c><00:18:26.100><c> can't</c><00:18:26.220><c> come</c><00:18:26.400><c> up</c><00:18:26.520><c> with</c><00:18:26.640><c> a</c>

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
problem and we can't come up with a
 

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
problem and we can't come up with a
solution<00:18:27.059><c> to</c><00:18:27.240><c> that</c><00:18:27.419><c> problem</c><00:18:27.799><c> like</c><00:18:28.799><c> today</c><00:18:29.240><c> so</c>

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem like today so
 

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.210 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem like today so
knowing<00:18:30.840><c> that</c><00:18:31.020><c> we've</c><00:18:31.260><c> put</c><00:18:31.500><c> them</c><00:18:31.679><c> in</c><00:18:31.980><c> this</c>

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
knowing that we've put them in this
 

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.250 align:start position:0%
knowing that we've put them in this
position<00:18:32.460><c> I</c><00:18:33.240><c> guess</c><00:18:33.360><c> the</c><00:18:33.600><c> question</c><00:18:33.780><c> is</c><00:18:34.020><c> what's</c>

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
position I guess the question is what's
 

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.810 align:start position:0%
position I guess the question is what's
the<00:18:34.500><c> right</c><00:18:34.620><c> thing</c><00:18:34.740><c> to</c><00:18:34.919><c> do</c><00:18:35.039><c> knowing</c><00:18:35.400><c> that</c><00:18:35.640><c> we've</c>

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do knowing that we've
 

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.510 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do knowing that we've
put<00:18:36.059><c> them</c><00:18:36.179><c> in</c><00:18:36.360><c> this</c><00:18:36.480><c> position</c><00:18:36.660><c> because</c><00:18:37.559><c> uh</c><00:18:38.280><c> you</c>

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
put them in this position because uh you
 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.770 align:start position:0%
put them in this position because uh you
know<00:18:38.580><c> they've</c><00:18:38.760><c> been</c><00:18:38.880><c> they've</c><00:18:39.419><c> been</c><00:18:39.480><c> wearing</c>

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
know they've been they've been wearing
 

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.110 align:start position:0%

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
these suits right along and so
 

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.789 align:start position:0%
these suits right along and so
um

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:45.950 align:start position:0%

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
in a sense there's just the hope that
 

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
in a sense there's just the hope that

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
to get at that's what I'm just sure so
 

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.830 align:start position:0%
to get at that's what I'm just sure so

um and and I I discussed this not in uh
 

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:30.770 align:start position:0%
um and and I I discussed this not in uh
with<00:23:26.640><c> other</c><00:23:26.760><c> people</c><00:23:27.140><c> and</c><00:23:28.140><c> explain</c>

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
I<00:23:31.320><c> realized</c><00:23:31.740><c> that</c><00:23:31.980><c> in</c><00:23:32.280><c> testimony</c><00:23:32.700><c> we</c><00:23:32.940><c> heard</c>

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
I realized that in testimony we heard
 

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
I realized that in testimony we heard
that<00:23:33.419><c> the</c><00:23:33.659><c> cost</c><00:23:33.900><c> of</c><00:23:34.140><c> this</c>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the cost of this
 

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.930 align:start position:0%
that the cost of this
is<00:23:36.600><c> probably</c><00:23:36.900><c> going</c><00:23:37.200><c> to</c><00:23:37.320><c> be</c><00:23:37.440><c> minimal</c>

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be minimal
 

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.690 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be minimal

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
because there won't be that many cases
 

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
because there won't be that many cases

it's not yes
 

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.490 align:start position:0%
it's not yes

so it would have been presumed it would
