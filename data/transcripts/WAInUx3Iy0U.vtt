I I don't understand why
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%

in group one
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
um they haven't been getting coal is I
 
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.100 align:start position:0%
think they got two in the last 19 years
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
and uh they've been falling way behind
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
and this is just an attempt to catch up
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
to everybody else
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
further question uh follow up sure

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement Association
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
um yes group one uh over the over the
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
course of time has gotten considerably
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
more uh colas than group two and the big
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
thing is group two does not receive
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
Social Security so last year
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
um when you when they gave that stipend
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
out of the 11.6 million dollars uh 10.75
 
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
million of that went to group one
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
um the way that the way that uh
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
legislation change because of this
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
committee they they put it so that it
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
was less than thirty thousand dollars
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
the median for uh group two is right
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
around uh 38 to 40 000 so if that that
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill did not help group two at all and
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
over time I have I have the data that
 
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.290 align:start position:0%
over time I have I have the data that
teaches

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
teaches
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
um uh like 13 to 14 percent over uh
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
group two as far as cost of living
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
raises because back in in the 80s and
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
early 90s when their special account was
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
around it it had to do with what money
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
was available in the special account for
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
you to get a cola so if group two didn't
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
get have money in their special account
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
we received nothing but if group one had
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
money they received colas so in the in
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
the 80s and early 90s uh teachers uh
 
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
were getting five percent cost of living
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
raises when group two were getting zero
 
00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:22.019 align:start position:0%
can you share that data with us I can I
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
can share it every time a system should
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
have it too but I I can look through it
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
and I can I can share what uh I have
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
which I did give to uh Marty but he's I
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk has a question uh she didn't
 
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
I have uh Kohler adjustments from July
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
88 to 2007.
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
um teachers received a 69.25 cost living
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
raise in that time frame where
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
did you make that information available
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
to the division I mean the notes on the
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
bottom of this page are my notes the
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
rest of it is from the retirement system
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
but my notes is from the two colas that
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
were granted
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
um in 2010 and 2019 they're both one and
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
a half percent coolest but I can if they
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
want to make copies of this yeah Mr
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hoffman please
 
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.730 align:start position:0%
Hoffman please
thanks

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you but the the major factor is
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
social security that we don't receive so
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh group one got eight point seven
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
percent so security this year police and
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
fire didn't receive that because we
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
don't get Social Security
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire has a question thank
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
um so in general the reason teachers got
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
a bigger part is the last Cola was
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
limited to those with thirty thousand
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
dollar pension or less whereas police
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
and fire are averaging closer to 40
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
right teachers and everybody else are
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
averaging more like 20. so that's that
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
that's why the reason that's why it was
 
00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:09.710 align:start position:0%
that's why the reason that's why it was
skewed

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
skewed
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
um all right so here's my suggestion for
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.650 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
this the reason it's so expensive the 84
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
million is because this is allocating
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
money permanently to this to this group
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
right it's it's it's really a pretty
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
honest bill in the sense that
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
um it creates this this supplement uh
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
forever and and fully pays for it this
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
year okay
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
um in the in the past when we've done
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
colas it's been for the
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
um like well the like the cola we did in
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
the last budget was just a one-time
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
payment it wasn't a forever kind of a
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
payment so
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that's what we need to do
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
with this one is say okay we'll take
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
care of you
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
for this budget season but let let
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
people decide in next budget season and
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
after and after what they're going to do
 
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.130 align:start position:0%
after and after what they're going to do
so

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.909 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
I think Marty's not here and I don't
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
have the detailed numbers but I think if
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
this became a one-time payment it would
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
be something other you know with the
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
same formula I think it would be
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
something under 10 million dollars you
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
know maybe close to 10 8 to 10 or
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
something like that be my guess but I I
 
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:36.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
Melissa could we reach out to the
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board and see if we can get a
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
firm number on representative McGuire's
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes we can and um Marty just
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
emailed me saying he wasn't able to
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
attend this morning but he did send over
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
accounts for who's receiving this so if
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
you want to back into a payment you want
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
to say they got a one-time one thousand
 
00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
dollar payment or we could back into it
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
now that we have the numbers but I also
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
can reach out for that that would be
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
perfect do you recall what the amount
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
was in dollar figures just for the last
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
Cola that
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
less than those people that get
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
something that receive less than 30.
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
sure so they received a 500 payment if
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
they're um
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
retirement allowance was
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
um less than 30 000 and the there was an
 
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740 align:start position:0%
appropriation for
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
11.75 million
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Griffin
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
I wonder why we're dealing with the
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board and I guess this is
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
this is their information correct the
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
top part is the the notes on the bottom
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
of mine but I understand
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting to know
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
which of those increases were one year
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
and which were permanent I can tell you
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
all of them were permanent that's all
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
permanent coal is right there
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
when we had the special account
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
everything was um
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
was permanent there was no one-time I
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say there was one some
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
one-time uh
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
stipends but thought that data is all
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
permanent coales that went into your
 
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.370 align:start position:0%
permanent coales that went into your
base

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
if you could confirm that Melissa with
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
the retirement
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire all right so notice
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
that this chart sort of ends on
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
2007 right 2008 and the the so the the
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
whole reason we have a 5.7 billion
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
dollar debt is because of the special
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
account right because there were there
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
were times when the
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
um retirement
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
um return on investments was higher than
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
the expected return our current expected
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
return is 6.75 percent so there were
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
times when the return was nine percent
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
ten percent like that right and and they
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
put some of that extra into the special
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
account and gave it away in extra
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
benefits right and and so but the
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
problem is the 6.75 percent is an
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
average it's it's not a maximum and so
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's going to be years when it's
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
negative like last year they had a minus
 
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.140 align:start position:0%
six percent return right so
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
so that's how they got in trouble and
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so they they gave away like this
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
list shows they gave away extra benefits
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
that were not part of the you know well
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
anyway they gave away extra benefits and
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
so got into trouble and and so not only
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
are we paying for that trouble now we're
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
asking for even more extra benefits now
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
it's it's a hard thing to to fund I
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
think can I make sure what the committee
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
commitment why I said is somewhat
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
accurate but back back when the special
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
account was set up the uh interest
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
assumption rate was nine percent and
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
anything over nine and a half percent
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
would go into the special account and
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
that really wasn't the reason why that
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
was some of the reason why we ran into
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
problems but the main reason why we
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
rented the problems is when they uh got
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
the Social Security offset for group one
 
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
back in 1988 it was a 200 million dollar
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that wasn't fully
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
funded and if you look back in history
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
and you look at the employer
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
contribution rates after 88 the next
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation that was was set up the group
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
one rates doubled because of the Social
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
Security offset that's when they went
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
decided well we're going to change the
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
methodology to open group aggregate
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
which was going to push the liabilities
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
out further and we've really never paid
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
the liabilities off and then they
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
changed the entrance assumption rate to
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
nine and three quarters percent which
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
saved the cities and towns 72 million
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and the reason why I know these
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
numbers I was on the Retirement Board
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
when all that stuff happened
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so that that was the main driver of
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh the system
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
um not being fully funded plus the the
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
actuary in my opinion was wrong by
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
saying we were 135 percent funded back
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
then and they wrote down 20 percent of
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
the assets to pay for the Social
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
Security offset
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
well the situation where of course now
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
is as a result as representative McGuire
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
stated some of the past practices and
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
now we're just trying to play catch-up
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
or at least try to restore some uh a
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
little credibility to the process and
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
take care of the unfunded liability
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
issue which I think we've done
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
some great stuff with as far as putting
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of that money aside for the
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability in one of the house
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
bills and I agree but as I testified on
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
this bill earlier we over 637 million
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
dollars was in the special account over
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
from 2009 to 2012. that money was all
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
captured and put into the Corpus and
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
what it did is low of contribution rates
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns on the backs of
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
the retirees because that was money that
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
should have been used to fund colas and
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
they took it off us the legislature
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
wrote legislation to take that money
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
capture it and put it in the Corpus of
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
the fund which load employer cost on the
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
backs of the retirees so I did I know
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a balance no
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
disagreement there but I'm just saying
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
the situation we're in now we're trying
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with balancing the budget and
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
trying to be fair to all retirees and
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
the people that are participating in the
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
system and just speaking for myself I
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
just think representative McGuire's
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
suggestion is probably a good one I
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
don't think we afford the 84 million but
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
we could probably afford a one-time cost
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
of living
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
increase as representative McGuire has
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
suggested but I'd like to hear from
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
other members of the division first
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative kimberles yes thank you
 
00:23:47.649 --> 00:23:47.659 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I also agree with that
 
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
opposition and I think I think it's fair
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's what we can afford to do and uh as
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire stated we as a
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
legislature should not be making a
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
policy I think that that's going to run
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
out forever allow the future legislate
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislators to you know take it session
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
by session in regards to
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know remedy given them the ultimate
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
remedy or over the course of many years
 
00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:16.850 align:start position:0%
remedy or over the course of many years
so

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hewitt any
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts there or
 
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.470 align:start position:0%
thoughts there or
Mike

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in we're talking about
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
making a one-time caller now I'm
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
wondering whether any of the ecolas that
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
we're talking about for example on this
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
form uh were one-time colas uh my
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when cost of
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
living increases were given they were
 
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.890 align:start position:0%
living increases were given they were
continuous

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
continuous
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
and you know to now say we're going to
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
give the uh we're going to give the
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
firefighters a one-time
 
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:04.340 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen the next time
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
well that will be up to the next
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislature right and that's been the
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative evil any thoughts
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I would like to see what
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
the cost is for the one-time Cola and
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
then compare it to what would be
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
appropriated under this bill
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we will have that I assume today
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
Melissa you think from Marty I just sent
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
him the email so hopefully we'll get it
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
today as soon as I know I'll let you
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
know all right representative McGuire
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to here's my back of the
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
envelope calculation if you give the the
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
pension fund 84 million dollars they'll
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
think of it that they can generate 84
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
million times 6.75 percent forever
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
right so 84 million times seven percent
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
is roughly 55 5.5 million or something
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
like that right well they'll also think
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
that these are people who are retired 10
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
plus years so they're going to be uh um
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
dying off at some point so therefore we
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
could spend a little more now right so a
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
little more is going to get you into the
 
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.100 align:start position:0%
maybe eight to ten million dollar a year
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
range to start with and then it would
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
Fade Out over time
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um may I ask I want to ask these guys a
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
question if I might sure yeah absolutely
 
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.549 align:start position:0%
question if I might sure yeah absolutely
so

00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
to me this
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
um this payment is a is a kind of a
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
charity right it's it's
 
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.090 align:start position:0%
charity right it's it's
um

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's not something we're obligated to do
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's something we want to do to help out
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
this group of people okay
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
but the way it's written the people who
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
are currently getting the best pension
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
get more than the people getting the
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
least pension right which is sort of the
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
opposite of the way you do charity right
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
with with Charity you you help the
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
people who are worse off more and at
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
least off less so I'm wondering if and
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
the other thing this this particular
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill has is it has kind of a step right
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know if you've been
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
retired nine and a half years nothing if
 
00:27:29.529 --> 00:27:29.539 align:start position:0%
you've been retired 10 and a half years
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
up there and the same thing at the 20
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
year mark right you know if you're if
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
you've been retired 19 and a half years
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
you get half as much as the guy retired
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
20 plus years right so but it'd be cold
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
if I may every cola that's ever been
 
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.890 align:start position:0%
if I may every cola that's ever been
granted

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
has that provision you have to have a
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
start point and unfortunately it's all
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know it's usually been July 1st so
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
if I get on the job June 30th I don't
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
get it you know so it right but that so
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
let me let me continue the thought so
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
first of all we could do it more like a
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
fixed payment to everybody everybody
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
gets two thousand dollars three thousand
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
dollars whatever the number is
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
um and therefore
 
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.330 align:start position:0%
um and therefore
um

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:13.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
therefore it helps the the person with
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
the smallest pension as much as the
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
person with the highest pension right we
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
could also make it capped in some sense
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
so if your pension is already
 
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:27.740 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars or something
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
you don't get you don't get the two
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
thousand or three thousand whatever you
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
see what I mean so would something like
 
00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:36.539 align:start position:0%
that be
 
00:28:36.539 --> 00:28:37.610 align:start position:0%
that be
um

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
what is your thoughts about it's
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
changing the structure I guess it's a
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated than what you think
 
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
because I'll give you a scenario if I if
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
I was a firefighter that had 30 years on
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
the job I retired I took my spouse for a
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of my my pension when uh
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I take a reduction the cover of my
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
spouse for that 100 I pass away now
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
she's collecting 100 of my pension
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
because I took a reduction
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
firefighter B might have worked 20 years
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
only took a 50 percent
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
um pension for his spouse that person
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
dies she's getting 50 so she's going to
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
get she's going to get more money than
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
the person that worked the 30 years
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
because her husband chose only cover her
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
for 50 instead of 100 that the other
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
firefighter covered her for so it it it
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
when you look at the totality it people
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
are giving up money to cover their
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
spouses for a benefit and that's where
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
it gets complicated that there's some
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
members that take a straight pension
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't cover their spouse for anything
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so they're going to get a higher cost
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
of living raise because they chose to
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
take a straight annuity and and not not
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
give up any money to cover their spouse
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
or other members did so that's where the
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
fairness is and I think over the years
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's always been when you give a caller
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's based on actually we just
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
started this probably
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
five years ago in 2019 was the first
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
time we started going on a certain
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
amount it was always based on the
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
person's complete pension and then they
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
decided well we're going to go with 30
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
000 in in two 2019 they booted that up
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
to uh 50 000 I think because of the
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
testimony from group two because we
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't get Social Security we should get
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
a little bit more so they booted it up
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
to 50 000 and then last year it was at
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand but this committee chose
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
to give it to people that make less than
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand which pretty much
 
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
excluded group two so I don't know if I
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
answered your question but it it is a
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
little more difficult than all right let
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
me let me follow up slightly so
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
um you said person X is getting more
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
than person Y what I suggested was
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
everybody get the same so you know but
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
but it's really more
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I guess Police Chief versus you know
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
Beat cop or something or standard
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
officer right police chief has got twice
 
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:01.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
so the police chief that may be making
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
more than 50 is only going to get it on
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
the first fifty thousand right okay
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
um or maybe person who retired in 1980
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
versus person who retired in uh 2000
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
right their their salary in general in
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
2000 was much higher than their salaries
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
in in 1980 right so
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
so the whole point is
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
it to me it just seems fairer to to
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
spread it out more evenly rather than as
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
a percentage because as a percentage
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
already the ones making fifty thousand
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
dollar pensions are getting twice as
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
much as those making twenty five
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar pensions right I know
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
you may not like this answer but what
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
you could do is base your base it on a
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar pension so if it's
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
you know uh five percent of fifty
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
thousand twenty five hundred dollars
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
everybody gets twenty five hundred bucks
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
you can go that route too
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
so that's my question is that's my
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
question would that be objectionable to
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
to you well I think it's been so long
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we've we've haven't had a cola that
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
I applaud anybody on this committee to
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
work to try to get the firefighters
 
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.789 align:start position:0%
work to try to get the firefighters
something

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
um so and uh the frustrating part is I
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
think we still have to go back at some
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
point the legislature is going to have
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
to realize that there's going to be a
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism for ongoing colas that coming
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
back every year like last year when we
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
came back it wasn't a budget year you
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
said don't we can't do anything for you
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
come back this year because it's a
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
budget year so we came back this year
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
and this it's the same answer we don't
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
have the money so come back another year
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
and so at some point they got to
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
recognize that colas were always part of
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
the retirement system from the Inception
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
of 1963. hi 67. the grant Coles were
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
always granted and now all of a sudden
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
they kind of forgot the retirees and
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't had colas in like I said one
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
Kohler and since 2010.
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
well we could that's another discussion
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think all right I'd like to hear from
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative baruti if he has any
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this aspect like like uh Mr
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
Bowden said I think that
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
for this year if we're not going to be
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
able to get what we asked for a one-time
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
shot is better than nothing I think the
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
guys would be happy to get anything
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
because up until now we've got nothing
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I mean the attempt is good you know I
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
applaud you for that but at some point
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can change the rate
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
or whatever representative grassy has
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
more money to invest represent grassy as
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
a question or a statement I yeah I don't
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a question I just wanted to
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
basically agree with representative
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
McGuire this is something that you know
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
when we were doing colas as a city
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
council member we would do colas which I
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
think as representative Hewitt has said
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
usually increases their base pay you
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
know increases the pay of everyone but
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are many times that we were unable
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
to do that and I think that the fairest
 
00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
way we did is we took how much money did
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
we figured out what that would be for a
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
percentage across averaged out across
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
the board and then if it was a thousand
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
dollars or if it was twenty five hundred
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
dollars everybody got that up to a cap
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's people over a certain amount
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't get it but you know most
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
everybody got it so the person at the
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
bottom the person who's struggling the
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
most got the most money and the person
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
at the top who needed it less got least
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
money got the least money but you know
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's what we did we took it at least
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
percentage they didn't get to lose money
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
but they got the least percentage so and
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's a if it's a reasonable a
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea and something we should
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.310 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea and something we should
consider

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you so I was going through my
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
retirement file here that and I see that
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
the there was a period from 20
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
2013 70 uh 17 no colas 11.
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
to 12 no colas
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
08 to 10 there was a fifth 1.5 Cola for
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
the first thirty thousand
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
and then prior to
 
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.810 align:start position:0%
and then prior to
um

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:13.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
2008 and I don't know where these colas
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
came from there's no note on the
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
retirement breakdown but there were
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
coal is small some you know as much as
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
4.5 for everybody going back to 1997. do
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know where those coal is provided by
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
the retirement system or the legislature
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
everything was legislatively we always
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
had to go to the legislative even when
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the special account was was uh enacted
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
they still had to go to the legislature
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
for approval for the cost of living
 
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.730 align:start position:0%
for approval for the cost of living
raise

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
because I remember some talk that um way
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
back that a lot of the colas were coming
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
from the Corpus and not General funds
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the legislature just said okay but
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
it was coming from the Corpus versus a
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation that's true
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's true I would say
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
until 2010 maybe all those colas were
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
coming out of um were coming out of the
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system and they were they
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
were basically billing the local
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
communities for the cost of the cola
 
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.210 align:start position:0%
communities for the cost of the cola
okay

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
so yes Melissa I just want to say that
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
Marty confirmed that all of these colas
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
are permanent have been permanent colas
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
the McGuire proposal we'll call it it
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
seems to be some support for at least a
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
one-time payment which would be in the
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of about 12 million dollars
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
I believe for up to 30.
 
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.630 align:start position:0%
I believe for up to 30.
um

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.490 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:48.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see uh right what polls have
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
been issued since
 
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
been issued since
2007.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah it might be in your file but the
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
sheet that I handed out stops at the end
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
of that that sheet Carries On from the
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
sheet that I gave you
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
Mike do you have that uh could you get
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
this from representative is that oh yeah
 
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:23.180 align:start position:0%
that's the same one okay okay thanks
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure so 2007 2008 was was a kind of a
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
double whammy year because 2008 the
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
stock market dropped significantly and
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
it was also when
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability sort of perked up
 
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
to the the attention of the of the
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
legislature and so
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
um since then I think there's been very
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
few because you know things we've been
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
trying to fix the you know the those
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
past problems that occurred during the
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
the period when these callers were were
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
given so yeah
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
and to add to that I think my memory
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
serves me right when this whole thing
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
became a problem
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature or maybe the
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system somebody wasn't paying
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
attention they were taking the colas out
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
of the Corpus and not realizing the
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
impact that would have long term so
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
there weren't general fund
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that was coming out of
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
and if I may Mr chairman that's that's
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
how it was set up even prior to the
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
special account I was up here from 1980
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
when the session used to be every other
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
year and they would set their budget and
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
give a two-year Cola and it would always
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
come out of the Corpus that would it
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't until just recently
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and that this bill is set up uh to
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
have it come out of the general fund but
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
um there's a bill that was stated
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing that's coming out of
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate that's coming out of the
 
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.690 align:start position:0%
the Senate that's coming out of the
corpus

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
corpus
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know we certainly don't want to make
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability any worse than it
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
is so
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
I think the only place it could come out
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
of realistically would be General funds
 
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.150 align:start position:0%
of realistically would be General funds
might

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's so cheap
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
all right well I don't see any
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
further questions we'll wait for that
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
additional information from the
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system on the um
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
McGuire proposal for a one-time payment
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent evil what what was the
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
Social Security increase this year was
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
it 8.7 percent
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
highest it's been in about 50 years I
 
00:39:35.099 --> 00:39:35.930 align:start position:0%
highest it's been in about 50 years I
believe

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
if I may ask I know you threw some
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
numbers around but what are you going to
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
the total amount you mean to spend yes
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I was thinking 10 million
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
dollars 10 million and and depending on
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
how many firefighters and police
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
officers are in those two groups that
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
would just divide that up essentially
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
yes we might have a cap
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know so that if you're you're
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
current so the way I'm thinking about it
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
the the the the taxpayer the average
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
wage earner in in New Hampshire their
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
salary is 52 000 a year so
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
there's some in this group
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
their pensions are much higher than that
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
right and so that's some that's that's
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
really 95 of the pensioners make less
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
than fifty thousand dollars I understand
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
but there's some yeah but so that's why
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
we cap it at 50 so that yeah we we don't
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
give someone that's making a hundred
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the the you know the
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
well the big pay raise the point is you
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
cap it you cap the base of the
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
calculation at 50 but you don't cap if
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
somebody was had a pension of a hundred
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they would still get
 
00:40:59.690 --> 00:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
the the x times 50 000. and so we could
 
00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:03.859 align:start position:0%
have a cap in the sense of nobody's
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
nobody's total payment is more than a
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars if you see what
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
I mean by adding this money
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you don't really have a dollar amount
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
you're just you're just gonna well we
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
could no no we can we'll get it we can
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
we can work it to make a dollar amount
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay that's what I mean you're gonna
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're coming out with a total dollar
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
amount a total dollar amount and then
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
figure it out and figure out what the
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
amount per person will be yeah exactly
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative grass yeah I think we
 
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
should we should figure out a percentage
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
and then we should figure out a wage
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we wanted like if it's fifty
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and we want to give
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
everybody who makes fifty thousand
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars a five percent raise
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
take whatever that comes out to
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
um then that's the amount of money that
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
we have in the pool and then we just
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
divide it equally amongst all the
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
employees so the guy at the bottom is
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to get probably eight or nine
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
percent raised whereas the guy at the
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
top could get a one or two percent raise
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
or stipend
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll look at a number of different
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
formulas right
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative evil well all I was going
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
to say is I think there's consensus that
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something yeah sure
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if that's helpful but
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's better than right
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
it would appear you know from when I'm
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
listening to a year that will at least
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
make something for those
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
um making 50 000 or less in their
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
pension some kind of a percentage and
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
we'll try to work it so it's a little
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
heavier towards those that are making
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
say 25
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
000 versus 50. that's I think yeah
 
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
I agree I agree
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I would being a math guy uh by
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
default if everybody gets an equal
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
payment the people are on a lower scale
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
are getting a higher percentage raise so
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's it's a no-brainer you
 
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.970 align:start position:0%
you know that's it's a no-brainer you
know

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay well uh be in touch representative
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
or you can come tonight or this
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
if we brought up again this afternoon
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
what's that you say no we're just having
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
a full Committee hearing on different
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
things this afternoon is the public
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
hearing for the budget so it starts at
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
two o'clock in reps Hall but I doubt you
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
would want to go
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go so therefore I like
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
getting a root canal yeah
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
remind me with
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate so if you're trying
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
to figure out percentages colas and
 
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's about seven or eight percent
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
something like that I believe the Social
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
Security was the inflation rate wasn't
 
00:43:58.569 --> 00:43:58.579 align:start position:0%
it 8.75
 
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:02.300 align:start position:0%
inflation rate yeah okay all right
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
yeah right all right thanks
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
all the colas were based on the cpiu so
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's Consumer Price Index Urban
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
cpiu but we don't we're not sure what
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
that was yes Consumer Price Index Urban
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
no no I mean the percentage okay
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
so wondering what the number was
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
so we'll wait and we'll get we'll make a
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
decision this week on this matter we
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
need to thank you very much yeah thanks
 
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.910 align:start position:0%
need to thank you very much yeah thanks
no

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
so uh Melissa Mr Hoffman you had a
 
00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:44.390 align:start position:0%
so uh Melissa Mr Hoffman you had a
handout

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
that you gave us a little update and I
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
think you have more updates for us as
 
00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:52.970 align:start position:0%
think you have more updates for us as
well

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:54.500 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's 70.4 I printed mine out at home
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:08.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:08.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah it should be
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
it will be noted as far as when we exec
 
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.430 align:start position:0%
it will be noted as far as when we exec
it

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
yeah we should talk about that yeah
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you do I think so
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
why is so here's the uh this will be
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
very helpful that you're getting right
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
now it will show everything that we've
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
done is grayed out in those areas it's
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
still under consideration or in white
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
and Mr Hoffman will
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
speak to this as soon as everyone's got
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
a copy so why is House Bill 250 not on
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
this let's do we already decide on it is
 
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.530 align:start position:0%
this let's do we already decide on it is
that

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think he was wrong let's see it was
 
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.870 align:start position:0%
I think he was wrong let's see it was
indeterminable

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
250 what do we do here
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so two 250 is still on our list to
 
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.170 align:start position:0%
yeah so two 250 is still on our list to
discuss

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.890 align:start position:0%
discuss
right

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
we had a work session on the 3rd of
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
March and
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
it was still open
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why it's not on that list
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
though yeah because I don't think its
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
status is really any different than 571
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
well it was indeterminable the amount of
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
money so maybe that's why it's not about
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
oh I see
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is the death benefit of
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
someone's I feel in the line of duty I
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
think it's because the impact occurs
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget so the impact
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
occurs in uh fiscal year 2026 the
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
indeterminable cost for 24 and 25 are
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
related to the pension uh the system
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
changes so they wouldn't be very much
 
00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:55.730 align:start position:0%
changes so they wouldn't be very much
money

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
have we ever asked the the sponsors
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
whether they intended to benefit the 19
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
individuals who are currently in that
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
situation the 19 spouses I think they
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
said yes wasn't that
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
they say it was going to include
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
everyone to a hundred percent off the
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
top of my set head it was retro it was
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
for new from that point forward we do
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
have an email out to them asking the
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
cost if we made it retroactive I see
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
yeah because I think the sponsor's
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
intent was retroactive but I don't know
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I don't remember I think
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they said
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
100 from the 50 that it is now yeah so
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
there therefore it's not a zero it's not
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
a zero but hopefully it never happens
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
except for those that are already
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting the 50 benefit but
 
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.690 align:start position:0%
getting the 50 benefit but
um

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
could we find the book for
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative uh from Rochester the
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill book that bill hatched it must be
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.089 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
because it'd be helpful if he had all
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
so for those of you that can't read the
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
number on the sheet that Mr Hoffman gave
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
out earlier it's 70.4 in that black box
 
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.450 align:start position:0%
out earlier it's 70.4 in that black box
on

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's this sheet here the single sheet
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
that we got a little earlier
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
with the uh it's
 
00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:40.339 align:start position:0%
you know there's a number in the Box 70
 
00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:42.230 align:start position:0%
you know there's a number in the Box 70
0.4

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
0.4
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that's our magic number that we have
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you so is this
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
paper showing that we're actually in in
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
Balance sort of because we have a minus
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
70.4 here but we have pluses
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
oh no it's the 37 is the only real plus
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
right at the end
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
right so we're we're still like 35 under
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be great Mike yeah no I
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
meant the the overall budget right so
 
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:26.900 align:start position:0%
I believe the two key numbers are the
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
70.4 2023 number and the 37.4 the the
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
2025 number right and one is negative
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
and the other is positive so thinking of
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
the budget as a whole
 
00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:43.849 align:start position:0%
the budget as a whole
um

00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
right now we would be effectively taking
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
out 33 million from the rainy day fund
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
if everything on this paper happened you
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
see what I mean
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
aren't both 2024 and 2025 positive
 
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.410 align:start position:0%
aren't both 2024 and 2025 positive
numbers

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
well 2024 is an intermediate number if
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
you look at that 43.7 yeah
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
I believe it goes back to the top of the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
page yes
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
where is it it should go to the top 2023
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
is the only negative number the and the
 
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
other two are positive numbers and look
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
to your point they kind of wash well
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
that see that's a little it's confusing
 
00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
because actually everything in
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
parentheses that's a plus like if you
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
look at it's a plus for us well it's a
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
if you it's a minus for us it in other
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
words generally I know it's a little
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
confusing but that so go to something
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
easy to look at go to House Bill 571
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
they call it see it shows a negative
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
because it's in parentheses but it's
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
actually it's a positive it's impacting
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
the budget or the unfunded liability
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
so you would think oh that's we're
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
taking away but that's an ad all those
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
things in parentheses are ads the
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
numbers that are
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
without parentheses or take away
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
from the number
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know why we always yeah it's like
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
backwards it's not intuitive
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.930 align:start position:0%
you did
Maguire

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:19.940 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
suggested yeah with 10 million instead
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
of the 84. yeah it would be a 10 in
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
there then we're done yeah we're done
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
almost except you know okay we want to
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
make changes so yeah well let's see
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just try to give a little bit of
 
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
I believe not positives so you're
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
starting up top with where the
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
governor's ending balances which is a
 
00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:47.210 align:start position:0%
governor's ending balances which is a
positive

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
94 million and 23 24 is a positive 25 is
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
a positive
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
the next line you come down that's the
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
difference just for general fund and
 
00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:58.460 align:start position:0%
what house Ways and Means
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
revenues came out versus the governor so
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 it was 5.4 million
 
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:04.970 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 it was 5.4 million
less

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
than the governor's budget
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
so you're taking that out the next lines
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
are all the changes to the bills that we
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
currently have acted on same with
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
division two and three and then
 
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
division two and three and then
um

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to get down there's some
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
other adjustments and Appropriations
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
that Mike Kane has noted I don't know
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
what they are exactly for but it's for
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
physical statutory miscellaneous
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
then you have a subtotal of the House
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
Appropriations which is 159 million
 
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.490 align:start position:0%
Appropriations which is 159 million
dollars

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
the variance is 164. I think that's the
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
159 plus the 5.4 leaving the balance in
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
23 is a negative 70.4 if you stop today
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
and just acted today that would be a hit
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
against the rainy day fund in fiscal
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
year 23. so you decrease the rainy day
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
fund at this point today by 70.4 million
 
00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:00.910 align:start position:0%
fund at this point today by 70.4 million
dollars

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
they are negative and then you go up to
 
00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:05.780 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 now here's your new budget
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
same sort of exercise except at the end
 
00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:12.140 align:start position:0%
you can see we're ending 24
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
43.7 and that's actually
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to 25 that's 2.8 million less than
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
what the governor had to spend so you're
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
really even though it's a positive
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
number at the end it's still less than
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
the governor so you actually are short
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
from the governor's budget 2.8 million
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay that's up on the line that says
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
prior your carry forward versus governor
 
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
up if you see that up at the top in 25
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
so it takes that out so you're ending 25
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
in a positive at 37.4 if that's helpful
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it is it it's a little different
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
than like standard accounting yes yes I
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
know you got to go back and forth the
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
positives and the negatives so it's
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
legislative accounting so one one other
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
big error on this I think is look at
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 we lost the 25 million
 
00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:04.069 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 we lost the 25 million
that

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
was in 2024 and I don't think that
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
decision has been made that was just
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
that was just an error in the fiscal
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
note the first time the 25 million is
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
appropriated is in 25. it's in 25 and
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
then in 26 the appropriation starts in
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
25 so it's just a revision to reflect
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.329 align:start position:0%
 
S

00:54:28.329 --> 00:54:28.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
I was just reading your email that you
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
sent this morning to me yeah sorry I
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
know it's confusing um
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
sorry so for the record my K and the LBA
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
Mike will set it all astray because
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see it oh perfect it's
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
legislative accounting here it is and so
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
really what I try to highlight and it
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't really show up so great on the
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
um when I have it in dark but basically
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
based on the spending through last
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
Friday and the decisions on the
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
divisions uh which just a majority
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
happening in one and two uh there would
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
have to be a drawer of 70 million
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
dollars and 23 out of the rainy day fund
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
so that 159.9 balance would come down to
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
about 89.9
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how the year would end the
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
year that's 23 that's going to end on
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
June 30th 23. based on your decisions
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25 the budget that you're
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
developing now in houseboat one and two
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
uh you are in a positive position at the
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium so 25 I heard
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire mentioning that's
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
the important year to keep an eye on uh
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
based on all your decisions you'd end
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
with a positive balance of 37.4 so apps
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
in any other decisions
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
um then 37.4 would go into the rainy day
 
00:55:43.559 --> 00:55:44.510 align:start position:0%
um then 37.4 would go into the rainy day
fund

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
so basically you're 89.9 just add
 
00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:50.099 align:start position:0%
another 37 million to that to bring her
 
00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
up to about
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
130 or so
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
but it would require
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
now if everything passed as is before he
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
went obviously I was just listening to
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
your debate on the cola bill for group
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
two I'm sure that will change I'm sure
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk about some of the
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
large Appropriations in 23 that may
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
change the other divisions are also
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
talking about some of their
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so it's just kind of a
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we're not required to spend
 
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.069 align:start position:0%
and we're not required to spend
everything

00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
well that's that's your model yeah
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
but but I personally I don't like the
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
fact that 436 changed
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
by 25 it looked like it's 25 million
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
easier because really that bill is a 250
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar bill it's just that it
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
shifted by one more year so it's 25
 
00:56:55.849 --> 00:56:55.859 align:start position:0%
million this budget but 50 50 50 50 25
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
like that right that's correct and so
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah until
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct so in some sense
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is less honest than the 571 because
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
571 said we want this and you and right
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
now right
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
um whereas this one they want this but
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
right now it's only that you know what I
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative evil I see a reaching for
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
you well I I don't want to sound like a
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
broken record but let's not forget that
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't repeal the communications
 
00:57:31.809 --> 00:57:31.819 align:start position:0%
tax we've got another
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
30-ish per
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
year is that right well I think Mike
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
you've been including that in this
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
numbers right that it's been repealed
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
right that's correct if you um reverse
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
the repeal you pick up I think it's
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
about 28.9 a year yes so it's about 29 a
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
year yeah
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes so what we're seeing in front of us
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think what Mr Kane has said these
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
numbers include the repeal but if yeah
 
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.309 align:start position:0%
numbers include the repeal but if yeah
okay

00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
I we have an idea along those lines but
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's it's still percolating so I'm not
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
quite ready
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
to propose it right now but yeah I we're
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
well aware about that with the
 
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
I was and I've been telling Mike Melissa
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
division one got a lot of bills you got
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of house filled to Appropriations
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
you have the highest number of agencies
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
that you're going through you're doing a
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
great job uh kind of cutting those off
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of dollars in division
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
one but you know you're going through it
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
I know division three you know they have
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
over half the budget
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
tough decisions they have to make and
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
you can look on this page they have some
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
bills but they're also having some
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
pretty significant debate on where they
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
want that to go
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
keep in mind and again you can only
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
focus on your division we're going to
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
track all the other divisions as they
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
make their decisions uh division three
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
you know may need additional money but
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just continue to update uh the
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
committee as we go forward but right now
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know other than 23 with some big
 
00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.299 align:start position:0%
decisions kind of remaining out there
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
we have excellent help from your office
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
it keeps us on track yes you get two of
 
00:59:25.329 --> 00:59:25.339 align:start position:0%
them so the extra bonus
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
so we need extra help
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I don't see any
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 changes in either of the
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
other two divisions are they
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
like further behind than we are
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
um not behind
 
00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:43.549 align:start position:0%
um not behind
um

00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
oh great I wouldn't say the brand like
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
division two does have one houseboat 560
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
that they're going to move into house
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
um on the education trust fund side
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
which is separate from this sheet
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
because division two is going to focus
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund they did
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
remove 75 million dollars in building
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
Aid uh so the education trust fund uh
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
that they're looking at right now has a
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
balance of about 104 million dollars but
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
I know there are going to be debates in
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
division two relative to education
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
funding uh School building in a couple
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
other requests from the other agencies
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh division three hasn't made any
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
decisions relative to House Bill 2 yet
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
their largest is I think it's about a 35
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation for rate
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
increases that they're going to talk
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
about later this week on how they want
 
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
about later this week on how they want
to

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of divvy those out I think
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
you remember the governor presenting a
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent Medicaid rate increase
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
across the board division threes uh
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
having discussions now and if there
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
should be providers that should receive
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
different amounts
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
but as I've heard right now they've kind
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
of staying within that amount I mean
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
obviously that could change
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and I think division two their
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
biggest decisions left to make on House
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
Bill to or education funding uh building
 
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions for Mr
 
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.150 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions for Mr
Kane

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
Kane
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
Mike and his staff are amazing so I
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
think you guys have already figured that
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
out so
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike thank you we'll continue to
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
update everyone I'll send this update at
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
the end of each day once I talk to Mike
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa and the other analysts based on
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
decisions or even ideas that divisions
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
are considering I can send you a regular
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
update on kind of where you'll end up
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
through the entire division entire
 
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee so you have an idea of kind of
 
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
where you're heading
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so we approved two
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
extra Auditors in um
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
the dra and they they claimed that by
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
doing so we would gain like two and a
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
half million in 2025 is this shown in
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
this paper somewhere uh not yet we just
 
01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
want to get the splits from uh dra I
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
think you approved two multi-state
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
Auditors could have an impact up to two
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
and a half to three million dollars and
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
twenty five uh that would be it's not
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
reflected yet that would be additional
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to make sure that we had
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes tra when they get new waterers
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
May focus on a specific tax a type of
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
tax so once we get their estimates on
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
which fund be it general education trust
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
fund we can update the sheet but
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Mr Kane again
 
01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:29.900 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
sure and feel free to um Mike and
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
Melissa we text regularly they're not
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
talking to their uh friends on there
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and I'm watching as I can
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
between the other divisions but I'm
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
willing to come over anytime if you have
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
well I was
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
I would say on
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
the fast Bill 212 we're still
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
anticipating getting something from Des
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
that would actually
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
change the text of what the fun can be
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
used for and add the 2 million we would
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
lose this two million dollars if that's
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
done it would just yeah we gotta get
 
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
done it would just yeah we gotta get
down

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
yeah it would knock it down I I still
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
um am a little concerned about what we
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
did with the with the prison just
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
because we did give them 10 million but
 
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of that's not enough I
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
don't think to get them going with their
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
designing work
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
I thought they said during the um
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
hearing that it was or during the work
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
session that was 25 million but I didn't
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
know if we could get them to give us a
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you shared that
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
discussion to you
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I mean I realize it's more
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
money yes
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
right they did ask for they did say that
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
designing a prison was more like a 20 or
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
25 million dollar thing than a 10 right
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
so if we wanted to just fully fund the
 
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
design but not the prison we'd have to
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
take the 10 that's
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
not on the sheet but it's in there and
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
make it 20 or something like that so
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
we'd we'd need a
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
to to give back some of this money right
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
so I mean my only thought was that we
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
would get a clearer indication from them
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
I mean he was speaking off the cuff when
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
he was here
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
at least we could consider it I mean
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
honestly my other thought is I might
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
talk to Public Works
 
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.329 align:start position:0%
talk to Public Works
um

01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
2 and see what's happening over there
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times when we're going
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
to take on a big project what we do is
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
we fund the design and Engineering to
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
get things going it probably really
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
should be there it's a capital yeah I
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
mean I think so too but so but the
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
starting point is we should get a good
 
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.109 align:start position:0%
starting point is we should get a good
number

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
did I make a
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
I served a long time at the local level
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
as a as a selectman
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I learned early on
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
what whatever you put in the Warren
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
article is what it's going to cost
 
01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
article is what it's going to cost
and

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
if you're going to raise that figure
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
really have to
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
getting it done
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
that you know at a reasonable price
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
if if you over fund it
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's what it will cost
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I I agree but I think there's
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
something to be said for the number of
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
square feet that's what he was basing it
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
on let's just see what they say yeah
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
because 10 million dollars is still a
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty price tag I know yeah but
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
that being said Mike and Melissa just
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
could reach out to Corrections and
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
it really would be nice if it was around
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
10 million and not anymore
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
should we go back to hospital yes let's
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh we've got the handout that Mr Hoffman
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
gave us that stated 313 that's a shaded
 
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.510 align:start position:0%
gave us that stated 313 that's a shaded
document

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
and you can see that at least on the
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
first page that we've done
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
pretty well there and what we'll do is
 
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.630 align:start position:0%
pretty well there and what we'll do is
just

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
just
um

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
let's see what PCB assistance that's the
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
for I'm sorry you know that's
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
the other top sheets a little less great
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay there we go
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
so 37 weren't we going to get something
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
as far as language Mike or Melissa on
 
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.289 align:start position:0%
as far as language Mike or Melissa on
that

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:00.299 --> 01:07:02.329 align:start position:0%
that
PCB

01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
PCB
 
01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:06.490 align:start position:0%
PCB
assistance

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
I think like I don't know what you were
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to say but maybe what the chair is
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about is that I had asked
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
director wimsat about maybe being able
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
to use some of the PCB money also for
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
pfas but that
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
discussion didn't really proceed because
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
this is really a water issue and not a
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
waste management issue so I I don't
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
think there's anything happening on that
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
at this point I think their inclination
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
was they wanted to leave it for pcbs
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's what you were thinking of it was
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I guess I was thinking of
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire yeah this is if you
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
remember I I spoke to the chair of the
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
resources committee which is if this was
 
01:07:58.089 --> 01:07:58.099 align:start position:0%
a bill that's where it would go
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and he he thinks that number one it's
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
not super urgent it should he thinks it
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be a bill next year because it
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough detail in it
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so so I don't think we should be
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
creating a brand new section in Des
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
or a new fund or whatever this does
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
without the resources committee seeing
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
it as a bill and then sending it on to
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
us so you know my suggestion would be to
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
leave at least leave the 6 million
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
unspent try to come up with you know if
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
you want an earmark or or a thought that
 
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the day we'll have
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
we'll have the 6 million if it comes in
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
as a bill next year this is a problem
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
that there hasn't been more pfas PCB e
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
since 1977 so therefore one more year
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know it makes much of a difference
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
so other other thoughts
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
grassy sake I you weren't here during
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
the discussion I think so what happened
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
was there was a settlement I forget with
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
whom on on the pcbs and in the rush to
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
do the settlement there wasn't a
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
provision in there that said that the
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
money had to be used for PCB remediation
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
and what happened was all the money went
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
into the general fund and I I thought it
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
was 31 million so this what they're
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
saying here is that they want to use
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
some of the money for its intended
 
01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:45.020 align:start position:0%
purpose and that is for PCB mitigation
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
my my problem with all is just that the
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
water person never really had a chance
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about it during the course of
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
the you know to talk about how acute a
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
problem is or or whatever
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little hesitant to wipe it out
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
at this point because I just feel like
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
we haven't had representing policy
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
discussion and I know representative
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I had a discussion about
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
this the other day is that most of the
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
PCB stuff you know yeah there hasn't
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
been any new contaminations over the
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
years but a lot of it is when when
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
construction or other things dredging in
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
particular happen is that these pcbs
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
tend to get
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
brought up from the sludge that's on the
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
bottom of a pond or a river
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
um you know where there is stagnant
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
water and then it ends up Downstream and
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
we've got significant issues
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
particularly in Great Bay where you have
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
shellfish Farms down there and and I
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
know we had a proposal from eversource a
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
couple years ago to lay a line and one
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
of the problems they were finding is as
 
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
they were digging down and dredging
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
areas we were getting PCB contaminations
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
that were occurring uh so and and it's
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
the same thing in other locations as
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
well there was a a
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about removing some old lines
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh old cable that is in Lake
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee and they said don't touch
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
it leave it there because if you touch
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
it you're going to have this issue
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
um this issue is out there
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh when it when it's going to happen we
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know new constructions that's
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
occurring other things that are
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
occurring uh dredging which occurs
 
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.169 align:start position:0%
occurring uh dredging which occurs
regularly

01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
um it's going to raise its head and we
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
should have something ready for it when
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
it does and so I would agree you know
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
the money needs to be left there
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
um whether we we leave it in the budget
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then have resources come in with a
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill next year to establish this this
 
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
bill next year to establish this this
program

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that I don't
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see anything you
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
can't say we're not going to see a
 
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
problem in the next 12 months but the
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
thing is is that
 
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.689 align:start position:0%
thing is is that
um

01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
this you know I would say there's a good
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
chance we aren't going to see a problem
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
in the next 12 months but but you just
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
can't you can't say that because we
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
could have a problem and so the money
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
should be available we should have the
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
ability to react at a at a future date
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
represent cambrells thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
and my recollection was when I asked the
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
question it was not so much this money
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
would be used for mitigation as they
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to use it for research to study
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
other bodies of water that they didn't
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
have a lot of data on because for
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
example the Merrimack River there has
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
been well documented where the issues
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
um but he was they were talking about
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
other bodies of water that they need to
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
try to discover could they be a problem
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
in the future having said that I agree
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
with both representative Grassley and
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
McGuire that this is something we could
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
hold the money until they provide a
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
all right represent Maguire so as I
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand that representative grassy
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
served three terms on resources so
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
perhaps he could submit a bill and take
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
it through the process
 
01:13:03.659 --> 01:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
it through the process
Etc

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
all right Mike and Melissa clear on what
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
right so remove sections whatever this
 
01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:26.510 align:start position:0%
right so remove sections whatever this
is

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
37 38 and 39 but
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
tell our colleagues we we want to
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
um we want at least a Six Million Dollar
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
Plus at the end of the budget for this
 
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.050 align:start position:0%
Plus at the end of the budget for this
purpose

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman when you say tell our
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues will that be part of just
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
informally that would be part of the
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the division one presentation when
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
they when we go through the house bill
 
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
they when we go through the house bill
too

01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
so we'll need an explanation as far as
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
the money will remain but before the
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
money is
 
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:15.980 align:start position:0%
allocated or appropriated to such a fund
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
legislation has to be brought forward
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
with the guidance for the use of that
 
01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.390 align:start position:0%
with the guidance for the use of that
money

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.550 align:start position:0%
money
so

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's it's not particularly
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
easy because if this was a retirement
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
Bill we could always stick money in the
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability and then later pass a
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
bill that uh that increased the unfunded
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
liability in a certain way right and and
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
so we can prepay such bills but in this
 
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:50.540 align:start position:0%
area you really can't so easily
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the rainy day fund
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
exactly or so or on
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
unallocated balance or whatever
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
see I was reading the sections
 
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.410 align:start position:0%
see I was reading the sections
um

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
and the way it's set up it also allows
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
for any gifts donations of money federal
 
01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:10.850 align:start position:0%
for any gifts donations of money federal
grants

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.810 align:start position:0%
grants
um

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
it also it appears to be we might be
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
making this a little more confusing than
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
it has to be but
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
well and
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
there is six million here it didn't have
 
01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
we could leave 37.38 but we could take
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
out the appropriation which is in
 
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.590 align:start position:0%
out the appropriation which is in
uh

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
38 dice
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
see because we there's
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's a creation there's the authority
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner can apply for and
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
accept funds but then you've got 38
 
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
which is the appropriation of 6 million
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and we could just reduce the
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation still like I mean that
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
takes 5 million and it gives them
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
something to start with there could be a
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
solution in the world next session with
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
our understanding that it will be coming
 
01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.669 align:start position:0%
our understanding that it will be coming
asking

01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
all right well everyone's good with that
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
reduce it by 5 million leave the
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
existing language in there which I think
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
is probably good to lead the language
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a little clearer next session yeah
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
we'll put a footnote in representative
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
grassy this will be something new a
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
footnote naming the legislator
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
okay so that we've got those three items
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
do we have a strawberry straw poll on
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
that uh 37.38
 
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
that uh 37.38
um

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I guess 39 okay and they're reducing
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
the appropriation from six to one
 
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.570 align:start position:0%
the appropriation from six to one
million

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
show a hands everyone okay with that
 
01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.090 align:start position:0%
show a hands everyone okay with that
gineanomas

01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
gineanomas
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
new subdivision historic housing
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
preservation tax credit
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sweeney I see was
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
going to look at some of that invest
 
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.770 align:start position:0%
going to look at some of that invest
below

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
oh I know it's we're going to wait for
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means I see the note here yep
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
who is going to do that Ways and Means
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
reach out was that
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
was it
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
I know he was going to do the others
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
with um invest and
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
all right we can we'll skip over that
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
so moving down I guess the next one is
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
83 84. that's a crystal McCall I'm sorry
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
I skipped one here yeah 75 75.
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
we were wondering about the Arca money
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.649 --> 01:18:08.659 align:start position:0%
best New Hampshire
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
Sweeney's work uh Joe is gonna get some
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
information on that we have a handout
 
01:18:15.719 --> 01:18:16.669 align:start position:0%
information on that we have a handout
um

01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
Karen umberger
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
oh and which one
 
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:25.340 align:start position:0%
on the invest New Hampshire okay
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
we could we can wait until Joe you know
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
gets you hopefully he's successful today
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
with this election or tomorrow oh is it
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
I guess so I would just
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I've found that if we talk
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
about an issue we get the handle if we
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't it gets lost you know
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
we have so many papers but you're
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
welcome if you will like it but I found
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
it it generally if we wait
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
um there's just so many papers and it
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
gets lost so I just on the on the invest
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
I mean the other thing is that all this
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
was paid for with arpa before and I
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't know what the intentions are with
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
arpa at this point I don't know if
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's something
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah well I think representative Sweeney
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
was going to try to get the answers to
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff for us
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
if my name is sure
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the thoughts I had
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
driving home I was thinking about this
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
Fund in particular is that the
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
investment New Hampshire money is this
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
under the governor's office and does he
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
have basically the control as far as the
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
council to dispense this money I believe
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
so and so that may be you know we've got
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the political sensitivities there of of
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
moving that money from his Department
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
over to New Hampshire housing if I think
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
that was one of the discussions that
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney and I had talked
 
01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
about to put the administration of the
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
money over there instead of having it in
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and so you know that's something that
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
would we would have to discuss
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh but uh yeah I I thought it was a good
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
idea you know if New Hampshire housing
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
is willing to take on that
 
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility but we'd have to take a
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
look at what their Charter says as well
 
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.810 align:start position:0%
look at what their Charter says as well
so

01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:26.330 --> 01:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
yeah and as representative evil said it
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
was all federal in the past and now it's
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
General so it makes a huge difference to
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
us being General funds of course 55
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars collectively right it
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
was a hundred million before of Arthur
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
right it was all on it right yeah
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
all right I apologize I skipped over uh
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
section 75 that was Granite place that
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
was right you were gonna someone's gonna
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
check on arpa for that which I would
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
um I have an email out to commissioner
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
Caswell on that question if the arpa
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
funds can be used for this
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
all right so then I guess
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
we can go down to 83. yeah and we were
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
so work workers compensation that's one
 
01:21:15.679 --> 01:21:17.390 align:start position:0%
so work workers compensation that's one
15.

01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
15.
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
I heard from
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
former Senate President Bragdon on this
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and if he's watching it's a good time to
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
come and speak to us uh he'd like to
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
talk to us about that workman's comp is
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
should we
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
he's pretty familiar with it and I guess
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
it has to do with a lot of
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
issues of people being disabled and
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
being able to hire those people not
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
being forced to pick up some liability
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
should they be hurt on the job so
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Bragdon would like to speak to us
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
on that representative yeah and I
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back from representative
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
infantine I can make a note to call him
 
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.189 align:start position:0%
infantine I can make a note to call him
again

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay this says representative rule
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
across the labor
 
01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:02.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where that came from
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
you do we know where that was me yes
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
represents representative wall yeah it
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
should be representative McGuire I guess
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
or maybe Mike has maybe I had it wrong
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
Jules Schultz still the wrong name yeah
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
because I know right person wrong name
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%

97
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
State Library so that's different than
 
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
the McAuliffe
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
well that's all resources they're coming
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
in so we want them to make a pitch for

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
I can check but we think it's tomorrow
 
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.370 align:start position:0%
I can check but we think it's tomorrow
okay

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
thanks a snowstorm
 
01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
we're all staying over tonight is that
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
so yeah tomorrow doesn't sound like a
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
good day and you know we we did receive
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
an invitation from the governor to be at
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
his office tomorrow morning at eight
 
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:33.380 align:start position:0%
o'clock or something so
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think that might not yeah
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
you saw the
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
I guess the next one is 139 that was
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities representative Maguire
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
again when you were
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%

01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
ever yeah I really don't think we got to
 
01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
ever yeah I really don't think we got to
this

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
I think I can answer that one yeah
 
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.649 align:start position:0%
I think I can answer that one yeah
energy

01:24:08.649 --> 01:24:08.659 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate they all came in
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
before we had House Bill 2. oh that's
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
right I invited him back I think it was
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
Thursday or Friday last week that you
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
would be interested in discussing how to
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
spill two sections with them that's
 
01:24:24.179 --> 01:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
spill two sections with them that's
right

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll check with Janet see if
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's a I think that was out of that
 
01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.350 align:start position:0%
there's a I think that was out of that
oh

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't that uh impressed by the
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate that I didn't I didn't
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
think these extra positions I mean this
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
is more of a personal thing but it's
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
also with two more positions right yeah
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
he was coming in to talk about that
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
specifically I thought
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's almost fair to talk
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay I mean he did talk about a little
 
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:03.500 align:start position:0%
bit yeah
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
it was to go to Regional meetings or
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll make sure that
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.570 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'll have to look at the
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
these other
 
01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
s these others like 140 surgical
 
01:25:47.219 --> 01:25:56.570 align:start position:0%
s these others like 140 surgical
benefits

01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
so going down to one I think
 
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.530 align:start position:0%
so going down to one I think
181

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
so help us out here Mike or Melissa so
 
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
the break between Department of energy I
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
see 147 179 so 179 budget Appropriations
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
transfer Authority 179 is uh doh
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
language that we see every year
 
01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:45.890 align:start position:0%
language that we see every year
concerning

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
um limitations on transfers from certain
 
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
expenditure classes
 
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh this year they're adding indirect
 
01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
costs bond insurance and Property and
 
01:27:09.649 --> 01:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm drawing a blanket on this one
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
yeah for these particular class lines
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
um agencies can't transfer for other
 
01:27:19.139 --> 01:27:20.570 align:start position:0%
um agencies can't transfer for other
purposes

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
can cannot cannot and they're asking for
 
01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.250 align:start position:0%
can cannot cannot and they're asking for
Ken

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
Ken
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
no this would just keep the language
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
that we see every year it's the section
 
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
that one of the sections that repeats
 
01:27:34.209 --> 01:27:34.219 align:start position:0%
but it adds those three bolded
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
expenditure classes okay
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
so any representing Kimbrell's so is
 
01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:42.980 align:start position:0%
there a financial impact
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
let's make this change uh not really it
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
protects like information technology
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
they have this fairly involved
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
allocation across All State agencies and
 
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.209 align:start position:0%
allocation across All State agencies and
if

01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
if an agency were to transfer money out
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
of there and not have it available it
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
would throw the whole thing out of wax
 
01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.410 align:start position:0%
would throw the whole thing out of wax
so

01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
um similar for indirect costs there's a
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
certain portion you know when an agency
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
receives federal funds
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the state is allowed to set aside a
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
certain amount for indirect costs
 
01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.010 align:start position:0%
certain amount for indirect costs
so

01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
that's restricted you wouldn't want to
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
have that money sitting there and be
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
something else okay so that's kind of
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
the theme for all of these sounds I
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
guess we're good everybody yeah
 
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.209 align:start position:0%
guess we're good everybody yeah
179.

01:28:37.209 --> 01:28:37.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
one so
 
01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:45.410 align:start position:0%
one so
180

01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like that's it's the same
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
language EX
 
01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.709 align:start position:0%
language EX
is

01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
so 180 there's certain classes that
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
this would allow to be for the biennium
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
and not lapse at the end of the first
 
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
and that we've done before right correct
 
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that's right so 180 check that
 
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.370 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that's right so 180 check that
off

01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:21.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
the same language reoccurring and for
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical benefits
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's true except this year they're
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that would have to do with the uh
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
retiree and employee and retiree Health
 
01:29:40.139 --> 01:29:42.770 align:start position:0%
retiree and employee and retiree Health
accounts

01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
because they have that bond to cover
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
claims and administer the benefits
 
01:29:52.689 --> 01:29:52.699 align:start position:0%
we represent McGuire
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
everybody okay
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right so 181 salary adjustment fund
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
salary adjustment fund is always existed
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
this would change
 
01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.330 align:start position:0%
this would change
um

01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
certification of the director of
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
personnel to the commissioner
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
and it specifies at the end legally
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
authorized salaries
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
and requires a report to governor and
 
01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:33.890 align:start position:0%
and requires a report to governor and
Council

01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
Council
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
so a certain General funding agencies
 
01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:38.060 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
have left over money someone may retire
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
and they hire someone at a lower salary
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
um other agencies May hire someone in a
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
higher salary than expected
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
this fund allows those agencies that
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
have extra
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation to contribute and those
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
that need a little bit
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
to draw on
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
it keep it keeps
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
agencies operating and
 
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.390 align:start position:0%
agencies operating and
provides

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:31:16.729 --> 01:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
a way to cover those circumstances but
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
in no in no case does the states spend
 
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
more than it's appropriated for salaries
 
01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:23.780 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
that sounds okay to me is that much
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
different than what's in RSA 98 which is
 
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
because in the fiscal committee we get a
 
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.729 align:start position:0%
because in the fiscal committee we get a
report

01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
01:32:03.659 --> 01:32:07.010 align:start position:0%
similar to
this

01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:11.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
98 does
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to follow up because when we
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 98 it says it's repealed
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
already so interesting so maybe that's
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
why yeah yeah so there's no section so
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's cleaning up the reference yeah
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
all right so this should be I'm okay
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
see that's
 
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
similar to the previous explanation but
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
for the benefit class lines
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
so here's yeah yeah so they're taking
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
out subject to the approval of governor
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
and Council
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
and then just giving an annual
 
01:33:09.659 --> 01:33:15.169 align:start position:0%
and then just giving an annual
information

01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's all right with me
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
the government wants it the governor
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to approve something yeah
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
why not let them we won't be here
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa any reason why we
 
01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
should have somebody look at this I know
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council being taken
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
away from
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be too concerned because the
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement
 
01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.149 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement
s

01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
okay I guess there's no
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
184 is just changing that title
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
budget director to the budget officer
 
01:34:35.410 --> 01:34:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
our officers paid differently than
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
directors right
 
01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
directors right
um

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
well there's a Governor's budget
 
01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.169 align:start position:0%
well there's a Governor's budget
director

01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a position in administrative
 
01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.729 align:start position:0%
and there's a position in administrative
services

01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
budget office that heads up that budget
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
unit and there are two different
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
positions and I I suppose this is just
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
to eliminate any confusion between the
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
two all right so I guess we're
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
good with that and then of course it
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
and there's a
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
change I'm just curious Mike how do and
 
01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.770 align:start position:0%
change I'm just curious Mike how do and
Melissa

01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
Melissa
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
how do they divvy up costs now with this
 
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to make sense the language
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
I mean it looks to me like it's just
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
01:35:32.219 --> 01:35:38.110 align:start position:0%
more specific
yes

01:35:38.110 --> 01:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
right which should sell out yeah I mean
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think it looks everybody okay with
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
that 185 I am
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay a 186 Appropriations Department
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services technology
 
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.770 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services technology
upgrade

01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
Mike of Melissa why wasn't this
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
in their budget and House Bill one or
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
what do they have for
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
could you put your fingers on it quickly
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
because usually upgrades are in the
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
their budget or yeah and we can look
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
into as it's not into their budget but
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
just a reminder of what this was this
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
was to upgrade the state's essential
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
budgeting system I think right now it's
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
held on servers and it was to upgraded
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the newest version and put it in the
 
01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.870 align:start position:0%
to the newest version and put it in the
cloud

01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
cloud
 
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.189 align:start position:0%
cloud
um

01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
but I can find out why it wasn't in
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
their budget but it was a I remember it
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
was a pretty serious ask from the
 
01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.270 align:start position:0%
was a pretty serious ask from the
commissioner

01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:50.900 align:start position:0%
well because it's a 2023 item that's not
 
01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
I mean they did they did talk about how
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
their their computer system was pretty
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
ancient and they you know yeah I kind of
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
just I guess I was assuming they had it
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
I saw a fairly significant line in their
 
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
budget yeah you would have thought so I
 
01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.890 align:start position:0%
budget yeah you would have thought so I
just

01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
could we get a little more detail on
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
that and I thought they had
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
they spoke of the upgrade in their
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
presentation to us so I just
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not like adding too many
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay that's 186.
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll try to get some more
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:50.300 align:start position:0%
so what do we have 188
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
oh this is where they're going to have a
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is where they're having trouble
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
getting people right yeah I think 189 is
 
01:38:13.139 --> 01:38:14.209 align:start position:0%
getting people right yeah I think 189 is
fine

01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
so 189
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.530 align:start position:0%
 
9

01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:35.540 align:start position:0%
9
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
section 190 is removing language that
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
authorize the governor to draw warrant
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
since it's in the operating budget now
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
that language is no longer needed
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.639 --> 01:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
independent agency administratively
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
attached it looks like that 191 we okay
 
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
with that
yeah

01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
and then this one's gonna get duties
 
01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.990 align:start position:0%
and then this one's gonna get duties
yeah

01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.629 align:start position:0%
yeah
192.

01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
192.
 
01:39:17.639 --> 01:39:23.450 align:start position:0%
192.
yeah

01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.709 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:34.689 --> 01:39:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
193 you took care of that representative
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
McGuire let me see
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah with something gave them everything
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted and then some
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
yeah they seem to be seriously yeah they
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
so what are your thoughts on this
 
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.850 align:start position:0%
so what are your thoughts on this
barking

01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
barking
 
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa what type of funding
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
are they talking about what did they
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
have aligned somewhere that
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
funding is appropriated
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
for additional parking we'll have to
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
look through the budget see if we can
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
find an appropriation for that memory I
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
think was somewhere in the neighborhood
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
of twenty twenty five thousand dollars
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it's in it's been in past budgets
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
of course what they don't use will Labs
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
but we'll get an answer on the dollar
 
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.290 align:start position:0%
but we'll get an answer on the dollar
amount

01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:50.699 align:start position:0%
maybe just kind of curious
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount might be it's
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable having a completely open
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I know well you could cap it maybe
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
or something
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
we asked to represent Griffin I'm not
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure I rarely understand what this is
 
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
all about
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
someone give us a summary
 
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
the quick answer is not everyone has a
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
space so they have to park in metered
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
spaces for
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it's probably about
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
300 yards up that way
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
to a residential street without meters
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
and then they have
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
traffic issues up in those areas
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
um especially in the winter when there's
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
snow Banks and kids trying to walk to
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so does this pay for
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
like spaces in the parking Concord
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
parking garage and School Street and
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
things like that is that
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
yeah see they're metered or spots in the
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
garage if they're available a lot of the
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
garage spots are reserved too
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
are these people that might otherwise
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
Park you know like when we don't have
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
session days they can park in the
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislative garage and yes stuff like
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
does all we also pay the city of Concord
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't we uh for that land with a parking
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the terms of that
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
lease are there's a it's like a hundred
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
year lease I think but
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
there is a payment in lieu of taxes to
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
the city for uh all the properties that
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
they aren't able to collect property tax
 
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.010 align:start position:0%
they aren't able to collect property tax
on

01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Griffin
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding on store street is not
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about yeah is that
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
they have the air rates
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the ground rates
 
01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:11.900 align:start position:0%
okay so next we go down to the
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
compensation for state employees that's
 
01:43:15.239 --> 01:43:16.850 align:start position:0%
compensation for state employees that's
a

01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:18.229 align:start position:0%
a
100

01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
roughly 100 million dollars for the
 
01:43:20.639 --> 01:43:23.390 align:start position:0%
roughly 100 million dollars for the
biennium

01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
do we ever get anything from the
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the breakdown for classified and
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
non-classified I know they were hoping
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
to come in right maybe today yes I had
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
invited them in for 10 o'clock today and
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
I didn't get a confirmation on that but
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
I just sent them after 10 o'clock
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
another email saying can you let me know
 
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
what's a good time to come in because
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to work out the details a
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more and discuss what they
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
had had so far on that breakdown between
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
unclassified and classified in the
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
different branches and the cost okay
 
01:43:59.770 --> 01:43:59.780 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold on that and it takes us
 
01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:01.570 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold on that and it takes us
through

01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:01.580 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
267 I believe that's agriculture
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so Melissa when you ask a question
 
01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:17.219 align:start position:0%
um they said something about these
 
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
tables being having diagonals right that
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
that like a GG Step One is the same
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
thing as a eff step two or something you
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
know something like that but I don't
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
really see that
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
so would you ask him about that sure and
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
oh I see what you're saying
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
yes I will ask about that it typically
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
did working in the executive branch it
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
used to be a diagonal line to that so I
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
will ask on that thank you thanks
 
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.709 align:start position:0%
will ask on that thank you thanks
Melissa

01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
Melissa
 
01:44:51.729 --> 01:44:51.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
267. I believe is the next what does it
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
beat me
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
it's what's that what page page number
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
eight 58.
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
oh the repealed Department of oh yeah he
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
remember he explained that that was all
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
covid related and unnecessary now and
 
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.169 align:start position:0%
covid related and unnecessary now and
say

01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
well thanks for catching that let's see
 
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.890 align:start position:0%
well thanks for catching that let's see
258.

01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
258.
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
what about 267.
 
01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:34.139 align:start position:0%
we got to go to 250. the clerk backed us
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
up the sound of something
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to agree on 258. these were
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
the things that he said were covet
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
related and no longer applicable yeah so
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
on page 83
 
01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.129 align:start position:0%
on page 83
258.

01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
so I guess if we don't need them anymore
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
we can get rid of 250 checkoff 250a
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
so 259 I have a note um
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
says Carol on here so I must have
 
01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.910 align:start position:0%
says Carol on here so I must have
okay

01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
so Carolyn Melissa have been working on
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
all the oplc stuff and I think tomorrow
 
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
if we have time is
 
01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
she could come in and discuss it all
 
01:46:42.179 --> 01:46:43.310 align:start position:0%
she could come in and discuss it all
right

01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
you want to set that up I think you're
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
spending some time with her right
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
assuming we're in tomorrow oh yeah yeah
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'll probably be in
 
01:46:58.450 --> 01:46:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
in New London
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
so Friday yeah
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
two or three inches
 
01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
plus rain maybe
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
all right so then then I guess Friday
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to arrange that yeah so so
 
01:47:15.239 --> 01:47:16.689 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to arrange that yeah so so
she'll

01:47:16.689 --> 01:47:16.699 align:start position:0%
she'll
 
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
they've have extensive Amendment for
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill too and and uh they'll have a
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
highlight sheet of what the changes are
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
um so if we need to ask her about this
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
we could do it at the same time
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right we'll mention it to Janet she
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
can put it on the calendar for uh Friday
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
9 30 okay Jan
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
yeah 9 30. I think so
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire the other
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative I'll check just to make
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
sure but yeah okay
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll text thank you it actually
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
looks really simple they're just
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
it just says to
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
which shall include but not be limited
 
01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
which shall include but not be limited
to

01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
all right you want to wait yeah okay now
 
01:48:14.090 --> 01:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
we already have Friday at 9 30 but maybe
 
01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
it just was it's just general work
 
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
so Workforce Development 216. oh no so
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
it would have to be Friday afternoon
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
there's jail car Friday morning
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay so um Friday one o'clock
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I do have that from
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:16.609 align:start position:0%
 
262.

01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.619 --> 01:49:19.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.109 --> 01:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
are these just simple changes Melissa
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
looks so good
 
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
yes when they created the department of
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
energy there were certain
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
pieces of the office of a strategic
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
initiatives that land in other places
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
and this cleans up the language to the
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
current structure
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
tax on meals and rooms population
 
01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:03.590 align:start position:0%
tax on meals and rooms population
figures

01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:09.890 align:start position:0%
 
264.

01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
next one's an appropriation okay so this
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
that Department's still
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
we can still do to come in yeah we can
 
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
so resource is it coming in later this
 
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
week so we can talk to them about the
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation they're scheduled to come
 
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
in tomorrow at 9 30.
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
I guess you are spending the night here
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative I think I can make it but
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
I live close so yeah
 
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.930 align:start position:0%
I live close so yeah
okay

01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:01.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
so to the agricultural Advisory Board
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with that
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think the commissioner
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture mentioned that
 
01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
271

01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
.
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
a lot this when the Attorney General
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
was in he talked about some Physicians
 
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:00.500 align:start position:0%
medical examiner type positions that
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
they had contracted before and now are
 
01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
State positions
 
01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:12.260 align:start position:0%
271 takes an existing position and
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
it will use whatever Appropriations are
 
01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.209 align:start position:0%
it will use whatever Appropriations are
there

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
the salary will be determined by review
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
and then the person in the position will
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
be offered that
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
the incumbent will be offered if they're
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
qualified will be up for the new
 
01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.609 align:start position:0%
qualified will be up for the new
position

01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
are we okay with those
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:08.209 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the the one thing in the
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that I thought
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
were possibly overspending on and
 
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're doing it deliberately it was the
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
Cold Case area oh that's right yeah yeah
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
they were hiring what one more person
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
for Cold Case something like that yeah
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to be to me to be a
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
low low benefit for you know operation
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
but who knows Melissa Mr Hoffman we've
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
never acted on the Attorney General's
 
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
additional request the f I had one or
 
01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:46.580 align:start position:0%
two more folks yes
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
yep I have another when we get to that I
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
have a list of all the additional
 
01:53:51.239 --> 01:53:54.229 align:start position:0%
have a list of all the additional
requests

01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
well we could take up I do recall
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire in the Cold Case unit
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
had some concerns but that's not this no
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
no but it reminded him of the okay
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
so she's certainly won 272. I think
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
that looks like clean up to me when the
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was in and
 
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
um going over that handout with the
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
organizational chart he talked about the
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
solicitor general being
 
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.850 align:start position:0%
solicitor general being
um

01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
placed in the division to you know for
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
the for the the boundaries between the
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
Legal Services they provide
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
seem to recall some of that are we okay
 
01:54:53.649 --> 01:54:53.659 align:start position:0%
with 273 and then moving on to 274
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
division of legal counsel amended so
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
yeah they're renaming the transportation
 
01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:03.050 align:start position:0%
yeah they're renaming the transportation
Construction

01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:09.050 align:start position:0%
okay
275

01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
in Department of Justice name change
 
01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:15.530 align:start position:0%
in Department of Justice name change
check

01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
so I had a question Mr Hoffman a
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
question mark next to 276 why would that
 
01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:22.850 align:start position:0%
question mark next to 276 why would that
be

01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:26.390 align:start position:0%
be
foreign

01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
as I understand it it's a function that
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
they've chosen to reap to put in uh
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
instead of Justice
 
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it was did we ever do we know that
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the Department of Health and
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
Human Services is okay with maybe that
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
was my question I've uh made Kevin
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
Ripple aware of this so when he works
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
with division three
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
um okay well the two of us will know
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
whether everybody's in agreement and
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
will represent McGuire if I had to make
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
a guess I would think that HHS often has
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
access to matching funds for things
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
Federal matching funds and this could be
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
I guess we can check it off as Mike is
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
reached out to Mr Ripple there's a
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
problem we can come back to it but we're
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
a news section charitable Trust 277.
 
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:39.169 align:start position:0%
a news section charitable Trust 277.
[Music]

01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
so 277 when you receive a payment like a
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
credit card or debit card payment the
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
providers charge you a little fee this
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
would allow the state the Attorney
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
well I think it's moving part of an
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
but why were they
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
I mean why did they need it because
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
well actually it may be yeah I think it
 
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.729 align:start position:0%
well actually it may be yeah I think it
is

01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
be for uh any registration annual report
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
notice and document
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay they wanted to think they want
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
the three percent yeah yeah right for
 
01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:40.460 align:start position:0%
the credit card
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state does it
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
registry does
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
it right I think that's all right
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
all right so we're okay with that
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
gonna break it in
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
section 278 cleans up old language
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
because they no longer require people to
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:08.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
so 279 no more than 30 percent of the
 
01:58:18.599 --> 01:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
so 279 no more than 30 percent of the
money

01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that would obviously mean less money
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the folks
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
seeking assistance I think we need an
 
01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:47.089 align:start position:0%
seeking assistance I think we need an
argument

01:58:47.089 --> 01:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
we want to eliminate it or get more
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
information let them make a case okay
 
01:58:59.689 --> 01:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
and once again I
 
01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.179 align:start position:0%
is this a case where they're they're
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
like hiring Consultants or something I
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
mean wouldn't all the people doing the
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
assistance doing the administration
 
01:59:09.599 --> 01:59:10.990 align:start position:0%
assistance doing the administration
already

01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
they also get
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
receipt funds from other sources
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is I believe Mike Melissa correct
 
01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
certainly correct me if I'm wrong I
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
should just let you describe it but this
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
is within the Attorney General's office
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
right as someone's a victim of a crime
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
there's money given to them towards
 
01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
there's money given to them towards
their

01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
the ability to raise more money there is
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
money that comes in but Mike you
 
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
probably do so the victims assistance
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
fund uh receives money from certain uh
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment or or court fees
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
um a portion of that money goes into
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
victims assistance fund
 
02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
victims assistance fund
um

02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
and then like you said it goes out to
 
02:00:19.729 --> 02:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
help victims of crimes
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
so this would just allow them to cover
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
more of their costs up to 30 percent
 
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
instead of up to 15 but we can follow up
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
and get some numbers
 
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah because certainly the victims that
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to have will be losing
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
funds this happens not necessarily
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's the thing you've got to see
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
where's the diminishing returns which
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
means that they're saying they're not
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
getting all the funds that you're
 
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:45.970 align:start position:0%
getting all the funds that you're
getting

02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:45.980 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
but they're not being able to spend the
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
time together get it and so they're not
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
they're not recouping as much money as
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
they should towards the fund that's what
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've got to find out and I think they
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
also provide an annual report so I'll
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
see if I can get a copy of that yeah
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah so
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
but my point is it if everyone who works
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
for the Attorney General's office is
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
already in the budget and already gets a
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
salary from the general fund what sort
 
02:01:16.129 --> 02:01:16.139 align:start position:0%
of and there's somebody who this is
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
their job right to work this area
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
how would they spend this money right I
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
mean when it says used for the costs
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
aren't the costs sort of already in the
 
02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
aren't the costs sort of already in the
budget

02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
02:01:33.169 --> 02:01:33.179 align:start position:0%
yes and I'm sure that they somehow
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
allocate the person's time between
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
programs and maybe they've just
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
determined yeah so maybe it's in the
 
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
budget as other funds right this is
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
another type item yeah we'll get the
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
details yeah thank you thanks Michael
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
so 280
 
02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.750 align:start position:0%
so 280
um

02:01:58.750 --> 02:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
administration of benefit payments to
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
existing benefits yes representative
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
the point is if we took this out that
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
might raise general fund Appropriations
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
right it's because if the budget already
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
says this guy's getting a salary from
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
other and we take this out now he's got
 
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be paid from the general fund right
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right so 280. let's get nervous when
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
I suck my stuff but it's just 40 000. so
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
there was a a benefit provided to uh
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
surviving spouses
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
that was uh repealed in 2014
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
but there are still two spouses alive oh
 
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
and this benefit this would fund
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
all right any questions
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
on there are we okay with that small
 
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman any thoughts
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
they've come in before for this too if
 
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
they are increasing this before there's
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
a the threshold cap on certain
 
02:03:55.729 --> 02:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
state-backed borrowing
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I believe this was like the peace
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
Development Authority used some of this
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
um environmentally Authority when they
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
redeveloped and then they paid the state
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
back so this increases it from
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
115 million to 200 million
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
any problem with that
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know let's all set everybody
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
it's not my favorite I know I was I saw
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
you sat back on this one getting away
 
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
from the mic yeah I mean I don't think
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
we should have these kind of programs
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's mine this is like
 
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
didn't the balsams go after some of this
 
02:04:48.169 --> 02:04:48.179 align:start position:0%
money wasn't when that
 
02:04:48.179 --> 02:04:49.129 align:start position:0%
money wasn't when that
um

02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:52.129 --> 02:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
gentleman was in
 
02:04:52.139 --> 02:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
gentleman was in
anyway

02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
but changing but the budget is not the
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
place to discuss that right I mean the
 
02:04:59.689 --> 02:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
police discussing this with a bill a
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead I think the blossoms did
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
seek some sort of State backed
 
02:05:09.179 --> 02:05:11.930 align:start position:0%
seek some sort of State backed
um borrowing

02:05:11.930 --> 02:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
I think they didn't get it because it
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
was yeah I don't remember all the
 
02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:19.550 align:start position:0%
was yeah I don't remember all the
details

02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is money that's helped a number of
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
communities attract businesses you know
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
when we took a look at saffron
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
um in Rochester we would competed with
 
02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
North Carolina
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
and the business Finance Authority was
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
one place that we were able to get some
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
loans to help them build their facility
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh its loans they're going to get paid
 
02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:37.609 align:start position:0%
uh its loans they're going to get paid
back

02:05:37.609 --> 02:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and it's not like some of these other
 
02:05:40.729 --> 02:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
loans we talked about where yeah maybe
 
02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
we'll get it one of these days you're
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to get it back uh and it was out
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
helped us attract them to the state of
 
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire instead of going to North
 
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:49.010 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire instead of going to North
Carolina

02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
Carolina
 
02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
um you know we used Tax incentives and
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
business loans once we've got these
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
things in place that was the package
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that they they accepted to come to New
 
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.950 align:start position:0%
that they they accepted to come to New
Hampshire

02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman could we get something from
 
02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:02.390 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman could we get something from
them

02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.410 align:start position:0%
them
um

02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
how much they have outstanding in loans
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
and what their interest rate their
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
present interest rate is that would be
 
02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
helpful I think Miss representative
 
02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
gliders have some good points as does
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
represent a grassy but I think we need
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
in 200 million dollars is a lot of money
 
02:06:34.450 --> 02:06:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
my children
 
02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
but it's still a guarantee it possibly
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
affects the state's credit running
 
02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
so maybe a comment from the treasurer
 
02:06:56.089 --> 02:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
would be in order it said it it does it
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
indebtedness of the state the state
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
backs this the state backing of this
 
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.810 align:start position:0%
backs this the state backing of this
available

02:07:05.810 --> 02:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.169 --> 02:07:09.179 align:start position:0%
you okay with that yeah can we could we
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
ask the state treasurer to comment on
 
02:07:17.290 --> 02:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
professional licensure we know where
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
that is Friday
 
02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:24.380 align:start position:0%
be there or be square
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
new sections or ad dive
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
Down The House bill 300.
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so what this was when we took our
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
vote to include it in the budget we have
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment and it had an
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
expense associated with it so that would
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
be included in the amendment
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
and that was like what 90 somewhat
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
thousand a year for that
 
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
to prove that we're gonna check that off
 
02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:55.070 align:start position:0%
to prove that we're gonna check that off
so

02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
News section new section Mike and
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
Melissa the the 300 well of an amendment
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes so we have the uh
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh the white yeah there's a another
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
request related to 300 that we haven't
 
02:08:16.129 --> 02:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
received back yet uh same but not that
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
they're late we just asked for it Friday
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
evening so right we'll sing for the next
 
02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
evening so right we'll sing for the next
one

02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
no but this is a different one yeah this
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
was the other one this was the pool boys
 
02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:40.250 align:start position:0%
was the other one this was the pool boys
band

02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
band
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
because to administer it they needed the
 
02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.450 align:start position:0%
because to administer it they needed the
money

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
these are how it's one new position
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
these are house bills we've already
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
talked about decided to accept by
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
putting them into the budget right right
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
so the bills themselves will be retained
 
02:08:58.970 --> 02:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
right and then and then next to your itl
 
02:09:01.129 --> 02:09:01.139 align:start position:0%
because it's they're no longer
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
right so that's it that's right
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and we just we just call them new
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a section number
 
02:09:09.649 --> 02:09:09.659 align:start position:0%
for the bill right we just got to get
 
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
I saw this on the back page seven
 
02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's two that we're just waiting for
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
an amendment on the first two
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
do we have the Lynn Oprah Amendment mic
 
02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
that I was under my name for the liquor
 
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner we want to
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't have it back in drafting yet
 
02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
so just for those that you may be
 
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
familiar it's always been an issue
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
with the division and the fiscal
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
committee about the closure of liquor
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
stores representative Ober when she was
 
02:09:46.970 --> 02:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
chair ahead of
 
02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:47.689 align:start position:0%
chair ahead of
um

02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
section in the budget that the Senate
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
removed two years ago to require the
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to come to both a
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and the governed
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
Council for the closure and that's what
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
this amendment is with my name on the
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
bottom is the same language to have them
 
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
at least notify Us in advance so there
 
02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:10.340 align:start position:0%
can be some public discussion about
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
closure versus right now they're
 
02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
required to come to the fiscal committee
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
after the fact to let us know which
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative umberger was also very
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
supportive of notification again so the
 
02:10:27.169 --> 02:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
public is aware of a closing
 
02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it oh just
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
a budget or am I streaming that I think
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's it was in the capital wasn't it
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
Mike it is in capital I know but I
 
02:10:49.609 --> 02:10:49.619 align:start position:0%
thought you saw it in okay I think when
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
Governor presented to house finance the
 
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
whole committee he mentioned the liquor
 
02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:56.629 align:start position:0%
whole committee he mentioned the liquor
store

02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:10:56.639 --> 02:10:57.410 align:start position:0%
store
um

02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
I know it's in it is I just didn't want
 
02:11:01.129 --> 02:11:01.139 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure there wasn't
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
duplication no duplication it is in the
 
02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
02:11:05.699 --> 02:11:13.790 align:start position:0%
capital budget
yes

02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
so do we know from retirement when we
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
might see them as far as
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 571 that was discussed this
 
02:11:28.129 --> 02:11:28.139 align:start position:0%
morning they give us any indication when
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
they might have some numbers
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
we don't have an exact answer I know
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
he's working it I did a quick
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
calculation while we were in here
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
because he gave the breakdown just if
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
everybody was at the maximum so that
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
five percent of fifty thousand and the
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
10 of 50 000 based on the years so that
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
I think the maximum amount if it was a
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
one-time payment would be
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
13.25 million so
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
it will be under that amount okay based
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
on it just to give you a rough ballpark
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
of where you're at thanks so much that's
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
very helpful Melissa you're welcome so
 
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing fairly well here I
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
break and come back at one
 
02:12:15.599 --> 02:12:16.609 align:start position:0%
break and come back at one
um

02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot left of course we
 
02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
have the full public hearing at two
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock so
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
was there any reason for us to come back
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
Mike other than we might get something
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
from somebody
 
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'll reach out to um
 
02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
Mr bragged until I'll give him a call
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%

which is a company that specializes in
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
helping self-insured companies and small
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
companies form groups uh in the area of
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
workers compensation we represent or we
 
03:41:08.809 --> 03:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
have in our trust uh over 400 New
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies uh in three
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
different trusts manufacturers
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
um Healthcare and Human Services and
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
lumber which is our longest standing one
 
03:41:19.969 --> 03:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
so anyone involved in Industries in
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
those ways are involved more than 400
 
03:41:24.170 --> 03:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
companies with uh yesterday until they
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
told me there were 28 000 employees in
 
03:41:28.849 --> 03:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
these companies that are covered by our
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp programs and today they
 
03:41:31.790 --> 03:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
told me they just brought in another one
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
with six employees so now we're at
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
twenty eight thousand and six employees
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh these are self-insured which means
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
that and by the way also in the back is
 
03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
Dan Bennett with New Hampshire auto
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
dealers if there's any questions later
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
on uh they also have uh hundreds of
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
companies and thousands of employees
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
that they cover through their
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
self-insured workers comp trust and I've
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
also spoken with New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:41:54.769 --> 03:41:54.779 align:start position:0%
Association uh all town cities school
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
districts in the state are self-insured
 
03:41:58.130 --> 03:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
for workers compensation through primex
 
03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:00.779 align:start position:0%
also very concerned about the repeal of
 
03:42:03.290 --> 03:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
the second injury fund uh basically
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
under especially a self-insured model
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
the companies pulled together not only
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
to pull their resources but to take a
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
proactive approach to safety if you join
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
one of the trusts that my client runs uh
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
you were forced to have the loss control
 
03:42:18.650 --> 03:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
people from the company come visit you
 
03:42:20.690 --> 03:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
and work with you to find ways to reduce
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
your claims a typical insurance company
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
may not be as concerned about that
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
because they make their money from the
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
premiums no matter what the premiums are
 
03:42:30.170 --> 03:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
as long as they win the bid if you're a
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
member of a self-insured trust you have
 
03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
a self-interest in lowering those claims
 
03:42:35.690 --> 03:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
not only because you get money back for
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
some of the the claims but your claims
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
and your premiums in the future are
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
based on your experience what's happened
 
03:42:43.969 --> 03:42:43.979 align:start position:0%
in the past so the example was giving me
 
03:42:45.170 --> 03:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
the day of someone who blows out their
 
03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
knee let's say uh at work blow with the
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
knee it costs a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
to repair it you know for lack of a
 
03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
better term repair it under the second
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
injury fund if you had blown out your
 
03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
knee somewhere else previously and they
 
03:42:57.889 --> 03:42:57.899 align:start position:0%
do all the calculations and they
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
determine that okay the the new employer
 
03:43:01.490 --> 03:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
is responsible for fifteen thousand
 
03:43:03.410 --> 03:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
dollars of that hundred the eighty five
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
thousand but balance gets covered by the
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
second injury fund but the bigger term
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
impact of that is further down the road
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that company that employed that person
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
they're only charged on the workers comp
 
03:43:16.729 --> 03:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
experience calculations a fifteen
 
03:43:18.290 --> 03:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar loss rather than a
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar loss so the
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
employee is made whole and I should
 
03:43:22.910 --> 03:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
point out by the way that strangely
 
03:43:25.490 --> 03:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
enough the uh the trial lawyers or the
 
03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
association for justice uh usually are
 
03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
adversary in any workers comp situation
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
they represent the employee we represent
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
the employer they agree with us that
 
03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the second injury fund is
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
a bad idea yeah and I guess I'll also
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
point out this is a major policy issue
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be tucked into the budget
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
in fact if you look at the summary page
 
03:43:44.090 --> 03:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the budget where it lists out all the
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
things in the budget it doesn't say the
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
second injury fund is in there so we
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
didn't find out until I think Friday of
 
03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
last week that it was in there
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
the bullet point says uh let's see the
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
bullet point says that a redirects
 
03:43:57.889 --> 03:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
workers comp funds from the general fund
 
03:43:59.090 --> 03:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Labor restricted
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
fund that makes sense and makes changes
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
to the employer insurance carrier
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursement process it doesn't say get
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
rid of the second injury fund so uh big
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
picture this is a huge policy issue it
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
really deserves its own bill with a
 
03:44:15.170 --> 03:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
substantive policy debate on both sides
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
but in reality this saves New Hampshire
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
employers a lot of money both in the
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
short term on the claims that happen as
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
they happen but when your mods start
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
they call it the mod your experience
 
03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
rating and workers comp starts going up
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
you pay for that for years so again we
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
represent twenty eight thousand and six
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire employees and over 400
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
companies and uh some of our board
 
03:44:40.010 --> 03:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
members for our manufacturers you'll
 
03:44:41.150 --> 03:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
recognize some of these names because I
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
look to see what township folks are from
 
03:44:45.410 --> 03:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh so Gilbert block from Laconia Lakes
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
Region community services from Laconia
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
um a nadnock paper from Bennington when
 
03:44:52.130 --> 03:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
I was in the Senate the folks from
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
Milford Lumber and Wilkins Lumber and PJ
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
Courier Lumber all involved with this
 
03:44:59.870 --> 03:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
they all want to see this retained Kelly
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
Trucking up in Gorham Boys and Girls
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
Clubs uh the All the Boys and Girls
 
03:45:05.570 --> 03:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
Clubs in the state are covered by
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
self-insured trust so I think it's in
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
all our interests to see this preserved
 
03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
but at least have a substantive policy
 
03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
debate about the merits and I think I
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
can wrap it up with with that I'd be
 
03:45:18.889 --> 03:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I used to
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
work for this company back before I as
 
03:45:22.370 --> 03:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
soon as when I was in the Senate so
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
probably uh 15 to 20 years ago when I
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
first started in the Senate so I
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
remember enough to be dangerous but if
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions I'll try to
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
answer it or the folks behind me might
 
03:45:33.410 --> 03:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
be able to questions for Mr Bragdon
 
03:45:36.170 --> 03:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin well
 
03:45:38.570 --> 03:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
you're telling us Rings true to me
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
because I served before I was in the
 
03:45:43.849 --> 03:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
legislature I served as a Chief
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer for a number of
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
companies and I know how important
 
03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
the broad rate is
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
to the premium
 
03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:45:58.190 --> 03:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
I did work for one company that was a
 
03:46:00.610 --> 03:46:00.620 align:start position:0%
major Lumber wholesaler
 
03:46:04.849 --> 03:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
so it was out of state but
 
03:46:04.859 --> 03:46:05.570 align:start position:0%
so it was out of state but
um

03:46:05.570 --> 03:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:07.490 --> 03:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything you've said
 
03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:08.570 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything you've said
basically

03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:46:11.570 --> 03:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
well I won't say anything else don't
 
03:46:15.290 --> 03:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
chairman then thank you for coming
 
03:46:19.979 --> 03:46:20.650 align:start position:0%
chairman then thank you for coming
um

03:46:20.650 --> 03:46:20.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:20.660 --> 03:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:46:22.309 --> 03:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
you said that this will save people a
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
lot of money if we keep it right but I
 
03:46:33.290 --> 03:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't see how because isn't Insurance
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
um what's would save money is if there
 
03:46:37.490 --> 03:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
were fewer injuries right where there's
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to be injuries there's going to be
 
03:46:41.330 --> 03:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
expenses for for
 
03:46:43.490 --> 03:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
um dealing with those injuries and
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's also going to be administrative
 
03:46:48.110 --> 03:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
expenses to determine you know the size
 
03:46:49.429 --> 03:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
of the injury whether it should be
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
funded all this sort of stuff but in a
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
sense doesn't this fund have expenses
 
03:46:59.450 --> 03:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
right and so if you look at the big
 
03:46:59.460 --> 03:47:01.309 align:start position:0%
right and so if you look at the big
picture

03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
um by getting rid of it we get rid of
 
03:47:05.090 --> 03:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
those particular expenses but we haven't
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
changed the number of injuries we
 
03:47:10.130 --> 03:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
haven't changed that so so overall I
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't see how this saves any money to
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
keep it oh thank you for the question
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so yeah overall
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
big picture wise the amount of money
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
coming in and out uh is unchanged uh the
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
the second injury fund is funded I
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
Believe by an assessment on all workers
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
comp carries in the state a small
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and then for those with
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
second injuries it's almost like a high
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
risk pool in the health insurance Market
 
03:47:34.429 --> 03:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and so especially when you're dealing
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
with a lot of smaller companies I think
 
03:47:37.849 --> 03:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
in the testimony the Department of Labor
 
03:47:40.130 --> 03:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
said that uh the New Hampshire the
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
Americans with disability Billy's acts
 
03:47:43.610 --> 03:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
has kicked in since this was started and
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need this as much anymore
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
but that only applies to companies with
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
more than 15 employees so a lot of these
 
03:47:50.210 --> 03:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
small companies lumber companies
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
trucking companies uh have less than 15
 
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
employees they're small companies so one
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
catastrophic workers comp claim can shut
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
the company down so by spreading the
 
03:48:02.090 --> 03:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
risk amongst all workers comp it
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually benefits uh it really benefits
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
everybody but especially those smaller
 
03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
companies and those that are
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
self-insured and the purpose the reason
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
for enjoying self-insured is they want
 
03:48:12.650 --> 03:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
to drive down that's how we help them
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
save money we work with them to drive
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
down the the cost of insurance by by
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
driving down the accident rates by
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
getting our loss control people in there
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
to recommend you should be lifting this
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
way you should be doing this you should
 
03:48:25.370 --> 03:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
be doing that and to be a member of the
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
trust you have to follow those
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
directions or I don't say you get booted
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
out but uh it's uh you know less likely
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
to want you hanging around because
 
03:48:34.130 --> 03:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to drive up everybody
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from Mr
 
03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:41.150 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from Mr
Bragg

03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
Bragg
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh the division's pleasure
 
03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh the division's pleasure
representative

03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:50.809 --> 03:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
I think it is a policy issue
 
03:48:53.330 --> 03:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
and it should get back kicked back to a
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
policy committee I don't think it has
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
any business here or in HP
 
03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:00.170 align:start position:0%
any business here or in HP
two

03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:49:03.170 --> 03:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
so representative Griffin is suggesting
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
through a motion that we eliminate
 
03:49:07.969 --> 03:49:07.979 align:start position:0%
section 115.
 
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
and we'll just we'll just have a show of
 
03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
hands if that's all right with the
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
division all those for removing
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thanks Mr Bragdon thank you
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
all used to be a time I got a vote when
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
I was in one of these rooms but that's
 
03:49:27.550 --> 03:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
that was a long time ago
 
03:49:30.769 --> 03:49:30.779 align:start position:0%
oh yeah represent McGuire is a comic if
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
you would like to introduce legislation
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
I I would say surely the governor has
 
03:49:37.849 --> 03:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
some friends in the legislature who
 
03:49:40.849 --> 03:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
could carry such legislation forward so
 
03:49:40.859 --> 03:49:42.130 align:start position:0%
could carry such legislation forward so
yeah

03:49:42.130 --> 03:49:42.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:49:46.250 --> 03:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thank you for coming
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
all right another one off-road list
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire had a good
 
03:49:59.929 --> 03:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
suggestion since we don't have a lot of
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
time before we have to be across the
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
street but just to touch on the bills
 
03:50:05.819 --> 03:50:07.370 align:start position:0%
street but just to touch on the bills
and

03:50:07.370 --> 03:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
all of you should have gotten a copy of
 
03:50:09.720 --> 03:50:10.729 align:start position:0%
all of you should have gotten a copy of
the

03:50:10.729 --> 03:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:13.250 --> 03:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
house bills before financing as you can
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
see division one is probably
 
03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
more than blessed with the majority but
 
03:50:20.809 --> 03:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
we've gotten through just about all of
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
them but they're only five being taken
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
up Wednesday
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
the first one being
 
03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:34.190 --> 03:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:50:37.370 --> 03:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is cast to speak
 
03:50:39.290 --> 03:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
to that as he made the motion of ought
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
to pass that's amended yeah so on this
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
one my suggestion would to the whole
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
committee will be so so I've already
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
we've already written the blurb we've
 
03:50:50.809 --> 03:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
already decided off to pass with
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment the amendment changes the bill
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
significantly in the sense that it
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
um adds money to the unfunded liability
 
03:51:03.290 --> 03:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
rather than sending it back to towns
 
03:51:06.010 --> 03:51:06.020 align:start position:0%
specifically so the same people
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
effectively are being helped in the
 
03:51:09.769 --> 03:51:09.779 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
03:51:09.779 --> 03:51:10.429 align:start position:0%
sense that
um

03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:12.170 --> 03:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
by adding money to the unfunded
 
03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
liability you're going to reduce the
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
long-term cost to towns in the similar
 
03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
proportion to what the bill does but it
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
spreads it out and and does it in a way
 
03:51:25.610 --> 03:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
03:51:28.330 --> 03:51:28.340 align:start position:0%
um encourage them to hire
 
03:51:31.090 --> 03:51:31.100 align:start position:0%
faster than they would otherwise
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
but because it's such a big change you
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
know so so essentially we're rewriting
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
the bill we're spending the same amount
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
of money in the same general way but but
 
03:51:43.370 --> 03:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
we're rewriting how it's done so my my
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
feeling is we should say hopefully get
 
03:51:48.290 --> 03:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
the whole committee to say ought to pass
 
03:51:50.929 --> 03:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
we send it to the house hopefully get
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
their approval and then at that point
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
table the bill before it goes to the
 
03:51:58.849 --> 03:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
Senate and and add it to the budget
 
03:51:58.859 --> 03:52:00.590 align:start position:0%
Senate and and add it to the budget
so

03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:02.090 --> 03:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
um I think that this should eventually
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
be in the budget in house bill 2.
 
03:52:05.640 --> 03:52:06.170 align:start position:0%
be in the budget in house bill 2.
um

03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:09.469 --> 03:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
but we should really get the approval of
 
03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
the whole house for this change for the
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
for for the the change of policy if you
 
03:52:18.889 --> 03:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.769 --> 03:52:21.779 align:start position:0%
can you representative Griffin
 
03:52:21.779 --> 03:52:23.170 align:start position:0%
can you representative Griffin
foreign

03:52:23.170 --> 03:52:23.180 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
basically saying it's not generic I
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
think it is generic Germaine Jermaine
 
03:52:33.530 --> 03:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh no it's not
 
03:52:36.170 --> 03:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
well right now it's carried in 2023
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
because we have sufficient funds
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so we'll have to be careful and
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
consider moving it into the budget
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
because right now it's being carried for
 
03:52:49.190 --> 03:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
it funding in 23 and we have the funding
 
03:52:53.330 --> 03:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
right so the the reason I'm I'm
 
03:52:58.969 --> 03:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
suggesting tabling it after passing in
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
the house is to have more leverage to
 
03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
get our way
 
03:53:07.490 --> 03:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
with the Senate and the governor right
 
03:53:10.190 --> 03:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
because if we simply let it go right you
 
03:53:12.729 --> 03:53:12.739 align:start position:0%
know we say off the pass
 
03:53:15.050 --> 03:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
I see a point you see what I mean yeah
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
but they could go to the Senate and they
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
could just itl they could say itl now
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
they've got 50 million to spend on
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
something else yeah no I see it right
 
03:53:25.370 --> 03:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
but this is what we want to spend 50
 
03:53:29.090 --> 03:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
million on and therefore you know we're
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
all converted I think yeah yeah well I
 
03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
was just going to say in the Senate
 
03:53:35.150 --> 03:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
isn't that how they do a lot of these
 
03:53:37.130 --> 03:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
things they actually table things and
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
then roll them into the budget
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely so you just have to make sure
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
that people
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
believe that if we table it we will put
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
it in the budget
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:52.370 --> 03:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
well at least get it through the
 
03:53:57.010 --> 03:53:57.020 align:start position:0%
committee Wednesday yeah I mean
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's on our sheet yeah it will be in the
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
budget so I mean we could just just so
 
03:54:04.969 --> 03:54:04.979 align:start position:0%
the other option is just to say retain
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:54:09.969 --> 03:54:09.979 align:start position:0%
right and put it in the budget right but
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think if you yeah you say this is the
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.610 --> 03:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's that's what I think so
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
awesome it's a much better solution than
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
the original bill yeah because it could
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's the continues to help those
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
cities and towns over a period of years
 
03:54:34.130 --> 03:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
it helps everybody the pension is
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
everybody and it's specifically going to
 
03:54:39.769 --> 03:54:39.779 align:start position:0%
the retirement fund versus you know for
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
some other project in a community so
 
03:54:45.650 --> 03:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
all right so next that the committee
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
will be taking up
 
03:54:49.550 --> 03:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
311 which we've already held on that's
 
03:54:52.750 --> 03:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
already in the budget so that's easy
 
03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
those are the so-called Buco bucks
 
03:55:03.530 --> 03:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah question on that one I I noticed
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
on the sheet it was changed from 25
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
million to 22 and a half
 
03:55:18.530 --> 03:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
was there some did we get better
 
03:55:20.929 --> 03:55:20.939 align:start position:0%
information no the reason that that is
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
we're taking 2.5 million from the
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislative budget
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
this is if there's more than 10 million
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
there so I see I mean are we reviewing
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget if they can't
 
03:55:37.969 --> 03:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
come in until after the 24th oh yeah we
 
03:55:42.610 --> 03:55:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
so the clerk needs to catch up yeah
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:53.809 --> 03:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
so next we have 506 that's the uh rail
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
chill box tunnel on exit 4A that was
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire
 
03:56:00.180 --> 03:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire
oh

03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:05.389 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
so originally that was
 
03:56:08.220 --> 03:56:11.809 align:start position:0%
so originally that was
um

03:56:11.809 --> 03:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
I guess that's just going to be itl
 
03:56:16.250 --> 03:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
so but if we send it back to the house
 
03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
as an Ito and they turn us down and go
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
back to octopic I guess I don't see that
 
03:56:27.290 --> 03:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
happening now the vote was eight to zero
 
03:56:30.410 --> 03:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
it was my handwritten notes here okay
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
all right so it could even be on consent
 
03:56:32.100 --> 03:56:33.410 align:start position:0%
all right so it could even be on consent
Maybe

03:56:33.410 --> 03:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
03:56:35.450 --> 03:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
although Pearson probably take it off so
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:38.710 align:start position:0%
I don't know
[Laughter]

03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
no I did McGuire and uh he did yeah yeah
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
all right so I was just thinking that if
 
03:56:53.689 --> 03:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
it should pass
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
the money should move to 2023. yeah
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
um but and so we maybe should have a
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment but but I think it's so
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
low low probability we don't have to
 
03:57:06.889 --> 03:57:06.899 align:start position:0%
worry about it yeah depending on what
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee does Wednesday I
 
03:57:11.450 --> 03:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
would think they'd probably follow our
 
03:57:14.450 --> 03:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
advice it would not be on consent
 
03:57:18.950 --> 03:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:18.960 --> 03:57:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:57:21.650 --> 03:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.610 --> 03:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
bought to pass I don't have who
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
was eight to zero I'll have to check
 
03:57:39.010 --> 03:57:39.020 align:start position:0%
this he was speaking to that
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
Janet's not feeling well so he'll we'll
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
get that probably uh
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
bright and early Wednesday who do you
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
have a record of who's I think I'm a
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor so I feel like it was
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.010 --> 03:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm really feeling it yeah we're
 
03:58:02.830 --> 03:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
all feeling it yeah
 
03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
I mean this is an easy one yeah that's
 
03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
it it probably actually has no effect
 
03:58:10.250 --> 03:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
on the budget this year not this year
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's a threshold
 
03:58:12.120 --> 03:58:14.030 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's a threshold
yeah

03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
all right so that's it for what we have
 
03:58:19.729 --> 03:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
as a division for Wednesday
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
and the others will be forthcoming
 
03:58:24.769 --> 03:58:24.779 align:start position:0%
should we talk about the other division
 
03:58:24.779 --> 03:58:35.689 align:start position:0%
should we talk about the other division
one

03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.250 --> 03:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
we talked about the other division one
 
03:58:39.290 --> 03:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
films because that it feels to me like
 
03:58:41.210 --> 03:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
we could maybe we can't because we're
 
03:58:43.010 --> 03:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
not in the calendar we can't act on them
 
03:58:43.020 --> 03:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
not in the calendar we can't act on them
but

03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:58:46.130 --> 03:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
no we it's you know they have to be
 
03:58:48.170 --> 03:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
noticed if there's a house bill but if
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
it was strictly a budget but we can
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about anything we've got
 
03:58:54.769 --> 03:58:54.779 align:start position:0%
a few minutes left just go over our list
 
03:58:58.849 --> 03:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so the first one is 46 that was
 
03:59:01.370 --> 03:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
ought to pass McGuire making the motion
 
03:59:04.729 --> 03:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.739 --> 03:59:10.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.170 --> 03:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
right because they took out the finance
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.309 --> 03:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've already talked about 50.
 
03:59:25.130 --> 03:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
74. unearned
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
that was itl representative Kimbrell I
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
think you've already given us a
 
03:59:39.849 --> 03:59:39.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:39.859 --> 03:59:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
212

03:59:41.570 --> 03:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
212
 
03:59:41.580 --> 03:59:44.269 align:start position:0%
212
FIFA

03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
FIFA
 
03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
see what's happening we're still waiting
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
now I thought we acted on
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
2 30.
 
04:00:01.130 --> 04:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
no it's not noted on the sheet here
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
right I believe that was ought to pass
 
04:00:06.950 --> 04:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
well no it's retained
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is going to go in the back yeah
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah it's got a hospital two
 
04:00:15.530 --> 04:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
amendment to add that you know
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
yes so do we know who made that
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
I don't recall not that it's that
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
important since we're putting it in the
 
04:00:25.610 --> 04:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
budget but we'll should update the sheet
 
04:00:28.150 --> 04:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits
 
04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
I had a note it was itl by McGuire
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I wrote that in there
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
what it was it was without
 
04:00:43.969 --> 04:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
recommendation so and I was gonna but
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's right but I'm gonna do the OTP
 
04:00:48.290 --> 04:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
right she'll write a blurb and I'll
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
write a blurb okay it has verbs will do
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
battle yeah exactly and it has no
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
physical impact
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
so it's just going to go back to the
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
house no limitation yes or whatever the
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
our committee ends up doing oh so evil
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
is going to do the I
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
so the next one 269 250. oh I'm sorry
 
04:01:19.199 --> 04:01:21.050 align:start position:0%
so the next one 269 250. oh I'm sorry
skip

04:01:21.050 --> 04:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
skip
 
04:01:23.150 --> 04:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
we were asking for more that's right
 
04:01:27.530 --> 04:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.729 --> 04:01:30.739 align:start position:0%
and then um now we can do
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
269 that was Sweeney ought to pass this
 
04:01:35.929 --> 04:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
amendment I think he's already given me
 
04:01:42.170 --> 04:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
the mitigation so and that retain is a
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
real live routine that's a real live
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
retained seven to zero I had my choir
 
04:01:51.239 --> 04:01:56.570 align:start position:0%
retained seven to zero I had my choir
that's

04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
well we're going to study we're going to
 
04:01:58.800 --> 04:02:02.269 align:start position:0%
well we're going to study we're going to
study

04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.279 --> 04:02:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
ing

04:02:07.849 --> 04:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.859 --> 04:02:15.050 align:start position:0%
 
something

04:02:15.050 --> 04:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:25.910 --> 04:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
is that where we had the chairman come
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
in from public works that's right yeah
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
when DDS was here actually yeah
 
04:02:36.170 --> 04:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
the problem is it's it's a really badly
 
04:02:38.090 --> 04:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
written you know maybe a worthwhile
 
04:02:40.849 --> 04:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
policy but the bill itself needs needs
 
04:02:40.859 --> 04:02:43.010 align:start position:0%
policy but the bill itself needs needs
help

04:02:43.010 --> 04:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:02:44.929 --> 04:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be an amendment to
 
04:02:52.560 --> 04:02:53.809 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be an amendment to
add

04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
add
 
04:02:53.819 --> 04:02:55.610 align:start position:0%
add
two

04:02:55.610 --> 04:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
position in there with about 90 some 1
 
04:03:06.290 --> 04:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.889 --> 04:03:11.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
recruitment incentive program that was
 
04:03:17.570 --> 04:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass or the representative
 
04:03:17.580 --> 04:03:21.170 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass or the representative
Weiler

04:03:21.170 --> 04:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right he yeah he did write
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
something up
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.239 --> 04:03:32.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.330 --> 04:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
already in the budget
 
04:03:38.340 --> 04:03:40.910 align:start position:0%
already in the budget
okay

04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:03:43.809 --> 04:03:43.819 align:start position:0%
it's 2000 years
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
so therefore we can just pass the bill
 
04:03:54.170 --> 04:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.370 --> 04:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
it should probably go together okay so
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.239 --> 04:04:12.610 align:start position:0%
 
hb2

04:04:12.610 --> 04:04:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:22.610 --> 04:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
not to pass represent Maguire
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah this one can just go back to that
 
04:04:24.540 --> 04:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
yeah this one can just go back to that
yeah

04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
it didn't really have a
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
347 that was
 
04:04:34.130 --> 04:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
goes to House Bill 2 and it was in the
 
04:04:34.140 --> 04:04:35.750 align:start position:0%
goes to House Bill 2 and it was in the
court

04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:04:38.570 --> 04:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
operating budget for an additional judge
 
04:04:38.580 --> 04:04:42.910 align:start position:0%
operating budget for an additional judge
yeah

04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.370 --> 04:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's a retained yeah
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
but where are we do we have a specific
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
language Melissa or Mike that we're
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
going to add for that to make it very
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
clear that was going to be a land use
 
04:05:02.210 --> 04:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.220 --> 04:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
language

04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
and what was missing from hospital two
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
was the change of a number of Judges
 
04:05:09.720 --> 04:05:24.650 align:start position:0%
was the change of a number of Judges
okay

04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.929 --> 04:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
so you're going to take all that 347
 
04:05:28.969 --> 04:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
land use language and put it in the
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
so our action is retained
 
04:05:38.809 --> 04:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
yep did we vote on that
 
04:05:41.330 --> 04:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
we did it I had just hb2 but I don't
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
think we did actually have a bow
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
we did accept the judicial branch budget
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
which included the additional judge
 
04:05:54.170 --> 04:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
so should I move that would make you
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
happy absolutely all right I'll move
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
retain on House Bill 347 with the
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
intention of putting all the language
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
into the um into how skeletons seconded
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
by representative Griffin show of hands
 
04:06:12.050 --> 04:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay so I don't you know what I
 
04:06:16.849 --> 04:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
don't remember much about this one the
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
next one 379.
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
Indigent tenants
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
eviction it was must not have been any
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
money there what like uh is that could
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
anybody have any recollection of that
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
since since I voted for it yeah I know
 
04:06:38.809 --> 04:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
yeah while nine to zero that just adds
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
language to the eviction notice
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
that says that service is from
 
04:06:46.319 --> 04:06:47.929 align:start position:0%
that says that service is from
um

04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
I think it's New Hampshire civil Legal
 
04:06:49.859 --> 04:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
I think it's New Hampshire civil Legal
Services

04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
legal services are available to the
 
04:06:55.370 --> 04:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
tenants when they're evicted and it
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
states that in the notice
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no cost
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this note here is isn't
 
04:07:07.610 --> 04:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
very informative
 
04:07:10.670 --> 04:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
on this because really this is when
 
04:07:13.370 --> 04:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
you're someone's being evicted this adds
 
04:07:15.410 --> 04:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
a sentence to the eviction notice saying
 
04:07:17.889 --> 04:07:17.899 align:start position:0%
Legal Services may be available
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
right that's right yeah you made the
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
question why are we encouraging more
 
04:07:23.929 --> 04:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
businesses yeah right because it's
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
expensive right yeah that's right but
 
04:07:28.849 --> 04:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
anyways that's what it is okay thanks
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
next one is representative evil I've
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
already seen her very good blurb
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
now are you going to speak against that
 
04:07:36.180 --> 04:07:37.550 align:start position:0%
now are you going to speak against that
representative

04:07:37.550 --> 04:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:39.650 --> 04:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
McGuire I know you were the one yeah
 
04:07:43.309 --> 04:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
maybe if it's not you know when you see
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
my blur twenty four to one if it's 24 to
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
1 and I'll let it go but it's 24 to 23-2
 
04:07:54.670 --> 04:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.030 --> 04:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
I vote first so I'm going to vote again
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
and really I don't know why I vote first
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know it's my world
 
04:08:06.530 --> 04:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
well here no it's not yeah but over
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
there somehow yeah well your division
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
one well it will be it will be the most
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
senior Republican voting first but
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
usually right now
 
04:08:20.210 --> 04:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
yeah which I well that's right it will
 
04:08:25.130 --> 04:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's a vice chair and full
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
committee and then it's the most senior
 
04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
Republican after the Vice chair I think
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
that but they seem to skip Earth and go
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
to me so oh we ought to change that yeah
 
04:08:37.739 --> 04:08:42.590 align:start position:0%
to me so oh we ought to change that yeah
but

04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.600 --> 04:08:43.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:08:43.809 --> 04:08:43.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.330 --> 04:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
the transition okay 436 which we're
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
still reviewing anybody want to talk
 
04:09:00.050 --> 04:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
so again just a reminder we're waiting
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
for retirement to get some more
 
04:09:06.610 --> 04:09:06.620 align:start position:0%
information back to us especially the
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
municipal impacts of this proposed
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is also is those of you
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
recall that an amendment was given to us
 
04:09:18.189 --> 04:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
Friday so that's still unfold
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
we approved that member we approved the
 
04:09:21.000 --> 04:09:23.210 align:start position:0%
we approved that member we approved the
amendments

04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:09:23.220 --> 04:09:25.429 align:start position:0%
amendments
yes

04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
right but so we still need to make a
 
04:09:30.650 --> 04:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
decision whether we're gonna
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
funded or because it's a significant
 
04:09:35.689 --> 04:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
amount of money so I'm not going to talk
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
about that our strategy right with house
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
bill 436.
 
04:09:40.020 --> 04:09:41.570 align:start position:0%
bill 436.
so

04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's we're retaining it because
 
04:09:48.410 --> 04:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's murky whether it affects towns and
 
04:09:49.729 --> 04:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
if so how
 
04:09:49.739 --> 04:09:51.349 align:start position:0%
if so how
okay

04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:52.729 --> 04:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
it passed the house super strongly like
 
04:10:01.130 --> 04:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
like 280 to 80 or something right so
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
um so therefore we really ought to do
 
04:10:05.689 --> 04:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
something with it now it's possible that
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
everybody who voted for it didn't
 
04:10:09.410 --> 04:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
realize that this is a 250 million
 
04:10:17.110 --> 04:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
well we just said we're going to hold on
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
we're going to recommend to the
 
04:10:24.290 --> 04:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
information I mean this is my plan so
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
is to recommend to the full committee
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we retain it but also that we add
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
the money for it to the unfunded
 
04:10:33.600 --> 04:10:34.910 align:start position:0%
the money for it to the unfunded
liability

04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:10:37.849 --> 04:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
to prove that we're in Earnest about
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
doing something in this area and
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
therefore if next year it comes out of
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
retain with an ought to pass in some
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
form we don't have to appropriate money
 
04:10:52.610 --> 04:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
for it it'll be already spent in the in
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and and so
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and if worse comes to worse we've
 
04:11:00.130 --> 04:11:00.140 align:start position:0%
spent money in the you know we've we've
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
we've put money towards the unfunded
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
liability so what's wrong with that
 
04:11:05.450 --> 04:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:11:05.460 --> 04:11:11.210 align:start position:0%
right so
anyway

04:11:11.210 --> 04:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
my Approach on this is
 
04:11:16.010 --> 04:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to it
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's very complex and the amendment
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything to make it easier
 
04:11:24.170 --> 04:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
is going to need a study committee
 
04:11:28.010 --> 04:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know long before the budget it's the
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
it's the house
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
I mean long it's it's going to take a
 
04:11:36.729 --> 04:11:36.739 align:start position:0%
long time to figure this one out
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
the problem is the people affected are
 
04:11:42.830 --> 04:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
starting to retire or getting close to
 
04:11:42.840 --> 04:11:43.969 align:start position:0%
starting to retire or getting close to
retirement

04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:11:46.969 --> 04:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
so I I tend to think we can be the
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
finance committee or maybe division one
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
can be the summer study committee for
 
04:11:53.170 --> 04:11:53.180 align:start position:0%
this that's sort of what retain does
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
right and
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
and the way it's currently set up the
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill itself doesn't spend any money
 
04:12:03.769 --> 04:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
until 2025. so it's okay to have it come
 
04:12:06.290 --> 04:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
out in January
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
with some kind of recommendation yeah
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're on the same page okay that's an e
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
DNA done a lot of work on this already
 
04:12:16.729 --> 04:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
or no well it did come to us from that
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee but I thought they had done
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work
 
04:12:23.689 --> 04:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
yeah although but not on the Amendments
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
right well not on the amendment but not
 
04:12:28.189 --> 04:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
on the money just significant which
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
nobody had a clue
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a financial commitment that once
 
04:12:37.849 --> 04:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
started it goes to 2033 I think yeah so
 
04:12:40.250 --> 04:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it's I'm
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on Earth you look at the
 
04:12:45.070 --> 04:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
policy is fine you're trying to write
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
you know that what some people view as
 
04:12:51.229 --> 04:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
an injustice and in the process of
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
correcting that
 
04:12:55.210 --> 04:12:55.220 align:start position:0%
Injustice and their quotes
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh you you solve a problem of retaining
 
04:13:00.239 --> 04:13:01.309 align:start position:0%
uh you you solve a problem of retaining
people

04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and recruiting people
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
and and from a policy committee why
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
be unanimous
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
but when you get down to the
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty what it costs and what it
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
does in terms of unfunded liability it's
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:23.450 --> 04:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
and represent Griffin is a good point
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
because there are so many priorities
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to retain people
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
as a three percent ask for those people
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
providing Home Services only three
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
percent in
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking even in this division we
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
have any money that we can give division
 
04:13:41.809 --> 04:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
three to maybe up that a little bit so
 
04:13:44.330 --> 04:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
four percent five percent but if you put
 
04:13:46.670 --> 04:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
25 million here you're not going to be
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
able to help people presently
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
on that end of this budget scale so yeah
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
but it's it's 250 million yeah over the
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
life of the you could do a lot of
 
04:14:02.689 --> 04:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
retaining with 250 yeah that's true you
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
could help build a prison yeah well
 
04:14:08.809 --> 04:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's retaining people too you know
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
so anyway so hopefully we're gonna hear
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
something by Friday on 436 hopefully we
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
can make a informed decision
 
04:14:25.570 --> 04:14:25.580 align:start position:0%
so we're all set with Karen on uh
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
462 right yeah that was in the budget
 
04:14:32.689 --> 04:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah ought to pass was seven to one
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
again it's going to be retained for
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals yeah
 
04:14:38.929 --> 04:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
04:14:41.210 --> 04:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
next one so then we have 504
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
Adult Parole Board that was ought to
 
04:14:45.889 --> 04:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
pass representative Hewitt that was
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
seven to two
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
and same thing right that goes in the
 
04:14:56.929 --> 04:14:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
so at some time representative Hewitt
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
you'll have to have a little blurb for
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
us when we go to the full committee
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
and that was uh 504
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
not re
 
04:15:09.769 --> 04:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
I think that's actually going to be
 
04:15:11.570 --> 04:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
retained right we're going to put that
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
in hospital we will still have to talk
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
to the committee but not necessarily
 
04:15:16.260 --> 04:15:18.469 align:start position:0%
to the committee but not necessarily
right

04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:20.450 --> 04:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
or be ready to speak to it I guess
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I should say yeah yes we we
 
04:15:26.450 --> 04:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
did not have a request to put 504 in the
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
budget but we can we can get an
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment for that right I think that's
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
the way the division is headed
 
04:15:35.450 --> 04:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
does that make sense Melissa Mr Hoffman
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
or what should it be standalone
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes right you know it is okay
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah because everybody was getting a
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
payment I think the chair the vice chair
 
04:15:55.729 --> 04:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
and wait that was the issue yeah I
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
remember your comments about that wow
 
04:16:01.849 --> 04:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
like a 50 pay raise you know
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
they went with the police there and
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
again to be Spirit chairman
 
04:16:11.809 --> 04:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
Commissioners new position but I don't
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
think you can move as much
 
04:16:16.490 --> 04:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
because all the other
 
04:16:16.500 --> 04:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
because all the other
things

04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I think it should be a standalone
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.849 --> 04:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
well I thought you were suggesting we
 
04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
put it in hb2
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
because it's it's ongoing expenses from
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
now until
 
04:16:43.080 --> 04:16:44.210 align:start position:0%
now until
eternity

04:16:44.210 --> 04:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
eternity
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
for for salaries right so why don't we
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
highlight it I mean you can't in a
 
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
budget year you can put all budget bills
 
04:16:56.450 --> 04:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
in the house bill one or two or you
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
don't have to a bill could be Standalone
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
if you want it to be then you could have
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
a debate on the floor that maybe you
 
04:17:05.090 --> 04:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
would like to have about the bill or
 
04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
anybody for that matter but if it goes
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget it will be lost in the
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
budget candid
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
so the pleasure of the division would
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
you like it to stand alone
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.490 --> 04:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay well then you'll definitely need a
 
04:17:22.500 --> 04:17:23.630 align:start position:0%
okay well then you'll definitely need a
blurb

04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
blurb
 
04:17:26.090 --> 04:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
and again I think that's probably a fair
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
way to do it because it yeah and there's
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
some disagreement on the division so
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we've got that real box
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
tunnel which again will be coming up
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that was itl
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh the chief security officer
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
04:18:01.010 --> 04:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
policy is that going into our hb2
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
Melissa I don't believe so there's no
 
04:18:05.090 --> 04:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on this bill it was just
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
putting into law so we just had it
 
04:18:09.550 --> 04:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
passed as is okay but wasn't this just
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
confirming the position yeah I mean this
 
04:18:16.370 --> 04:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
could be a bill yeah
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
so that was you representative Maguire
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
as you saw that could be consent
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't it that could speak in sync I
 
04:18:22.800 --> 04:18:27.229 align:start position:0%
couldn't it that could speak in sync I
guess

04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
then we
 
04:18:31.969 --> 04:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
and relative to assistance for natural
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
disasters that was
 
04:18:34.800 --> 04:18:37.429 align:start position:0%
disasters that was
itl

04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:18:40.490 --> 04:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think that's a committee report from
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
then down to 555 to discuss that already
 
04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
then five
 
04:18:53.880 --> 04:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
then five
71

04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
71
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
and then down to 576 administration of
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
commercial property that was represented
 
04:19:13.969 --> 04:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
as sweetie working with mangaputi
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
I think that was
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
he's already got a blurb for that that's
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
not on our agenda yet does that not
 
04:19:24.729 --> 04:19:24.739 align:start position:0%
oh there's no General funds
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay so that can just go on its own I
 
04:19:28.140 --> 04:19:28.849 align:start position:0%
okay so that can just go on its own I
think

04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that is it they're like 26 guys have
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
done a great job and we really we're in
 
04:19:37.849 --> 04:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
a good place we have great leadership I
 
04:19:40.090 --> 04:19:40.100 align:start position:0%
don't know about the leaders
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
we have a good members I'm very
 
04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
means with what we've done and
 
04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
especially with our staff so we're
 
04:19:50.450 --> 04:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
getting there representative Griffin
 
04:19:54.290 --> 04:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
I just heard today that the
 
04:19:54.300 --> 04:19:55.969 align:start position:0%
I just heard today that the
Senate

04:19:55.969 --> 04:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh made
 
04:20:00.170 --> 04:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
me thinking about putting the
 
04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
communications tax back in
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
and replacing and replacing it by
 
04:20:07.969 --> 04:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
repealing the
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
utility tax estate the path that goes to
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:20:12.359 --> 04:20:14.809 align:start position:0%
the state
huh

04:20:14.809 --> 04:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
huh
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
well yeah I mean
 
04:20:19.130 --> 04:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
should just talk about yeah I mean we
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I think representative McGuire has
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
some good ideas right okay so so here's
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking about
 
04:20:25.800 --> 04:20:28.790 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking about
um

04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.849 --> 04:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
so we have a problem in the house
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
getting the budget through period right
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
because normally
 
04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
at least in my experience it's a hundred
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
percent partisan the majority votes for
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
the budget the minority votes against
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
the budget and you know it passes I mean
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but there is no majority this year
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
essentially right and so
 
04:20:54.479 --> 04:20:55.389 align:start position:0%
essentially right and so
um

04:20:55.389 --> 04:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:59.090 --> 04:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
on any given day it varies and I can
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
tell you for sure there are some
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
Republicans even if we are in the
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
majority on that particular day that
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
don't like the budget right there's the
 
04:21:07.849 --> 04:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to vote against
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
it because it's you know taxation is
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so therefore we gotta have if if
 
04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass a budget and it
 
04:21:23.210 --> 04:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter even that you know if
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass a budget in in April
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
or we're going to pass a budget in June
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
you've got to have votes from both sides
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
and we need to pass a budget so we have
 
04:21:34.969 --> 04:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
a position at the table yes to
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
participate with the Senate yeah and and
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think if we do pass a budget in April
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
we will have super strong bargaining
 
04:21:46.729 --> 04:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
position with the Senate because we're
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
going to say look you know just because
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have their votes that day who's gonna
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
know what votes we have in June 30th
 
04:21:57.889 --> 04:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
right so you better not change too much
 
04:22:00.290 --> 04:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
or you better have super good you know
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
justification for changes because if
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
they say you know wholesale all kinds of
 
04:22:04.920 --> 04:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
they say you know wholesale all kinds of
changes

04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
that may change the whole you know
 
04:22:12.050 --> 04:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
calculus and dynamics of the whole thing
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
right so okay
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
so then yeah go ahead the reason I
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
brought it up was just so we don't get
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
blindsided okay so so the question is
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
04:22:23.640 --> 04:22:25.189 align:start position:0%
what can we do
that

04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:27.769 --> 04:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
um will attract votes from both sides
 
04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
right from the holdouts kind of or or
 
04:22:34.210 --> 04:22:34.220 align:start position:0%
whatever and so maybe there's some
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
non-budget things that will attract some
 
04:22:40.910 --> 04:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
votes right and we can talk about that
 
04:22:43.849 --> 04:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
separately but in terms of money things
 
04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
and the communication tax
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
um what I think would it would attract
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
votes is to change around what tax is
 
04:22:58.849 --> 04:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
cut okay currently the interest in
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
is scheduled to Sunset
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2027.
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay which is
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
another cycle away
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
if we change it to January 1st 2025
 
04:23:20.150 --> 04:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right that's
 
04:23:22.969 --> 04:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
um just before the next legislature
 
04:23:25.490 --> 04:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
takes if takes office
 
04:23:28.490 --> 04:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
right so it's within our our fine our
 
04:23:30.769 --> 04:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
budget right because there's another six
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
months of our budget to go right at that
 
04:23:33.300 --> 04:23:34.670 align:start position:0%
months of our budget to go right at that
moment

04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially two years earlier
 
04:23:39.170 --> 04:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
right so if we Sunset the interest in
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
dividends tax two years earlier that
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
will attract Republican votes because
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
this is a big deal to to really clean up
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
not having an interest not having it an
 
04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
income tax right because this is we're
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
always on a list of people with income
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
tax we have an asterisk because we have
 
04:24:01.090 --> 04:24:01.100 align:start position:0%
this tax right so so that two years
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
would say it's finally gone you're still
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
six months away from the next budget
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
right so it's harder to bring back Etc
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be very attractive I
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
think to Republicans
 
04:24:17.210 --> 04:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
and and to Democrats it says well
 
04:24:21.290 --> 04:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
compared to current law you're only
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
um losing two years worth of income from
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
this tax at the declining rate so you're
 
04:24:30.650 --> 04:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
talking about a year at two percent and
 
04:24:32.210 --> 04:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
a year at one percent kind of thing
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
right or more or less so but to get to
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
attract Democrat votes what if we don't
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of the communication tax
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
right so the idea is
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay ongoing long term there's another
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
tax there right because it because the
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
way the budget is written now there's
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
two taxes going away right the interest
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
in dividend taxes going away and the
 
04:25:01.010 --> 04:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
communication tax is going away but if
 
04:25:03.729 --> 04:25:03.739 align:start position:0%
we say let's keep the communication tax
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
to offset the Lost revenue from the
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax then there's
 
04:25:13.010 --> 04:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
a long-term
 
04:25:17.210 --> 04:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
um uh Revenue source which presumably
 
04:25:18.889 --> 04:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
would be attractive
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
to Democrat votes right so is that just
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil so
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
you know well but I know but you
 
04:25:30.530 --> 04:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
complained today what about the
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
communication tax right so yeah so
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
you see whatever you wish for it do you
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
see what I mean so so we'd be trading
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
off sort of a certainty on the interest
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax going away versus
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
um a long-term Revenue Source in the
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
communication tact so
 
04:25:53.460 --> 04:25:54.010 align:start position:0%
communication tact so
um

04:25:54.010 --> 04:25:54.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's an idea that that we have
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
to possibly get more votes for the
 
04:26:03.170 --> 04:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
budget in general okay do do we have any
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
idea what the IND would be in 26 and 27
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
I wonder
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
he's working yeah so
 
04:26:14.050 --> 04:26:14.060 align:start position:0%
um I think doing what I just described
 
04:26:18.050 --> 04:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and if we don't change the rate of
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
the interest and dividends tax
 
04:26:23.090 --> 04:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
in the second year so clearly we're
 
04:26:25.330 --> 04:26:25.340 align:start position:0%
currently in the interest in dividends X
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
2023 the rate is four percent
 
04:26:32.330 --> 04:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
20 calendar year 2023 because it's a
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's a January to December type tax
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
right so it's currently four percent
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
right scheduled to be three percent and
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
two percent like that so if we don't
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
change the three percent next year
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
cutting it off six months early is
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
roughly a 35 million dollar hole okay
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
but if we leave the communications tax
 
04:27:02.510 --> 04:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
in it's that's a 56 million dollar thing
 
04:27:05.450 --> 04:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
right so we're actually gaining money in
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
if I if we do what I just described okay
 
04:27:13.130 --> 04:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
we are hurting the next budget
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
by roughly I think it's about 40 or so
 
04:27:19.849 --> 04:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
we can calculate that but but again the
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
next budget is currently scheduled to
 
04:27:24.889 --> 04:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
only be in the two percent one percent
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
group right so
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so it's minimal it's more minimal
 
04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
anyways and then long term there's an
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
extra 56 million or whatever the the
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
communications tax actually is declining
 
04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
right so it because it's naturally
 
04:27:43.859 --> 04:27:47.269 align:start position:0%
right so it because it's naturally
declined

04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:27:51.490 --> 04:27:51.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
04:27:56.050 --> 04:27:56.060 align:start position:0%
please bring your name place with you
 
04:28:23.050 --> 04:28:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
think about
 
04:28:27.649 --> 04:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
are there non-budget things
 
04:28:38.410 --> 04:28:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.490 --> 04:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
but I think they're you know there may
 
04:28:41.809 --> 04:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
be some other discussions to put in
 
04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
place and I'm not so adversity you know
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
posting it for people to be able to get
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the schedule over Democrats on this
 
04:28:51.170 --> 04:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
budget okay I don't know what other
 
04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
direction so we haven't talked to the
 
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
other patients about what we've all done
 
04:28:54.540 --> 04:28:56.779 align:start position:0%
other patients about what we've all done
is
