00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're on definition of a child with a disability for purposes of special education.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The prime sponsor of that bill is whom?

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Representative, are you here?

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes, you're welcome.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.500
So let's call you up and get marching on the bill.

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Do we have all the green cards in?

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Green cards.

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Wake up, Rick.

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Maybe green ought let's go instead of red.

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Yeah, the department is here for technical assistance.

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Okay, so, okay.

18
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Representative Boyd, welcome.

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Thank you, Mr.

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Chairman.

21
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:08.500
And through you to my esteemed colleagues of the general court, my name is Bill Boyd, and I represent Hillsborough District 21 in Merrimack.

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:26.000
And I come before you today asking for an ought to pass recommendation on House Bill 1513, which modifies the definition of a child with a disability to include persons through 21 years of age.

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This language change to RSA 186C colon 2 would codify the federal definition into state statute.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Current federal law 34 CFR 300.101 paragraph A states in brief that a, quote, free appropriate public education must be available to all children residing in the state between the ages of 3 and 21 inclusive including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school as provided for in 300.530 paragraph D as you can see in the proposed bill the minor language change made RSA 186 C colon to uses that federal language verbatim I'm very grateful to two of my Merrimack constituents, Attorney Bob Bevel and the Honorable Nancy Murphy, for bringing this issue to my attention.

25
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I have brought along copies of their testimonies.

26
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They've been emailed to the committee as well.

27
00:02:33.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I do ask that they be entered into the public record, as these has, as I just said, have been submitted through the legislature's online portal both are parents of children with disabilities and both are actively engaged with this with this bill which has previously been been before this committee having been filed in 2020 is house bill 1558 I hope you'll take the opportunity to when evaluating 155858 and 1513, that you'll take the opportunity to review their comments in that context.

28
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.500
As some of you may know, 1558 passed the Education Committee by a 20-0 vote.

29
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:37.500
While I am a new legislator, yet somewhat familiar to the legislative process, I know it can be quite uncommon for bills to have a unanimous bipartisan support and committee.

30
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.000
The fact that this occurred two years ago speaks loudly to the appropriateness and the rationality of this bill.

31
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Today, I'm hoping that behind me are some parents that believe that the New Hampshire Department of Education should follow the federal special education law and that children with disabilities should be entitled to the same level of access to public education services in our state regardless of the school district providing these services.

32
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.500
Currently there exists an inconsistency amongst New Hampshire school districts in the interpretation of both federal and state law.

33
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:37.500
Consequently, access to special education services in our public schools for 20 to 21-year-old students has become confusing and, in some cases, frustrating for parents and their children.

34
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:46.000
There are many compelling reasons why children with disabilities who are aging out need House Bill 1513.

35
00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:00.500
In the testimony today and the testimony that you have received online, I am confident that you will hear many stories from those in support of House Bill 1513.

36
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.000
For me, there are two compelling and salient reasons.

37
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
One, equitable treatment.

38
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:25.000
By codifying federal law with state law, the definition of access to services across the state of New Hampshire would be consistent, and the varied interpretation of state statute by our school districts would be eliminated.

39
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:49.500
While each student's IEP would most certainly drive their access to services, the determination of when special education support services end for our special needs students would become clearer and finite in being in control of the parents and the people that are helping the parents with these children.

40
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.000
And two, continuum of care.

41
00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Diagnosis, rehabilitation, and maintenance are key components of the continuum that guide and monitor the child and his or her development with the special education IEP.

42
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:27.000
As the child approaches that age out phase, parents of special education students would be able to work closely with their IEP team to create a smooth transition from public school to adult life, while building a future framework for their child's adult years.

43
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Being new to the world of special education, there's been a bit of a learning curve for me.

44
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:57.000
One of the things that I've learned is I know that special education rules in 2015 and 2016 process during my process of learning was emotional for many people involved with the process due to the ambiguity between federal and state law.

45
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I certainly apologize for any redundancy.

46
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000
However, I want to reiterate that I see this bill as a great opportunity to align federal and state law.

47
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:22.000
This bill will clarify the law, create guidance to special education administrators and teachers, and make consistent policies and best practices in special education.

48
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:35.000
As a quick aside, I have been made aware of a letter written by Attorney Gerald Zellin to the committee in opposition to House Bill 1513.

49
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.500
I also want to acknowledge Karen Rosenberg and Mike Skibby of the Disability Rights Center.

50
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:50.500
I did have an ex parte conversation with them regarding the usage of the word inclusive.

51
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.000
Merriam-Webster defines inclusive in three different ways.

52
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.500
One, covering or including everything.

53
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.000
Two, open to everyone, not limited to certain people.

54
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:36.500
and three, which is the term that that the federal law uses which is what i'm seeking to include in the law is including the stated limits and everything in between as in a program for children three to twenty one years of age inclusive meaning children ages three to twenty and the age of twenty one using the language suggested by attorney Zellin in his letter would create further ambiguity.

55
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:45.500
Using the language as proposed and what is utilized by the federal law is clear, simple, and unambiguous.

56
00:08:45.500 --> 00:09:00.500
Ultimately, New Hampshire students would not be granted more services than what is mandated by federal law, but passing House Bill 1513 would ensure that they do not receive fewer.

57
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:20.000
When students with disabilities leave high school better prepared to navigate the world and engage in successful social and professional relationships, maybe transition to post-secondary education, employment, or independent living, we are setting them up for success in society.

58
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:35.500
8th House Bill 1513 has great bipartisan support, both publicly and legislatively, and I would urge my esteemed colleagues to vote favorably on House Bill 1530 and vote ought to pass.

59
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:54.500
And the one last thing that I would add as it relates to the bill itself and the analysis, it uses the language up to 21, which I feel is somewhat contradictory to the body of the bill.

60
00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:10.000
And I would urge that if there is an opt to pass recommendation, that that analysis be addressed in your report as being extemporaneous to the language of the proposed law.

61
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Thank you very much for your time, and I certainly would be very gracious to entertain any questions.

62
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.500
Thank you very much, Representative.

63
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
Are there any questions?

64
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500
Yes, Representative Cordelli.

65
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.500
Yes, if you're not going to be testifying.

66
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.000
Thank you, Representative Boyd, for being here.

67
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:51.500
Maybe you know the answer to this, but when I was doing my research on the age question, it seemed to me that it was over half the states do align with the federal 21 inclusive language.

68
00:10:51.500 --> 00:11:20.000
I don't remember the exact number, and I wish I had brought it with me, but one of the questions also in relation to that is when they turn 22, if it's in the middle of the school year, do they continue through the rest of the school year, or are their services ended at that point?

69
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And it seemed to me that my recollection of the article I read is that there's a split in those states that do 21 inclusive and some states provide for the rest of the school years and some do not.

70
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.500
Do you have any information or maybe the department would be a better source for that answer?

71
00:11:48.500 --> 00:12:00.000
I would defer to the Department of Education, but I would strongly suggest to you that you can go one of two ways.

72
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You can stop services when that child turns 22 or if they're in the middle of the school year, allow that child to wrap up the year and be able to complete the school session with his or her peers.

73
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.500
I certainly think that's appropriate.

74
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.500
Thank you.

75
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.000
Thank you for the question.

76
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Thank you very much.

77
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Are there further questions?

78
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Yes, Representative Litchfield.

79
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Thank you.

80
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.500
Thank you for bringing this bill toward.

81
00:12:38.500 --> 00:13:42.000
In our particular district, we do cover the children at age 21 so I just assumed everyone did my question to you is I noticed that it needs to be put into this would be effective within 60 days my thought process is so that the budgeting happens kind of 18 months in advance would would we want to consider possibly making this although I think it's important important that it be effective immediately I don't know what that would do to school budgets so thank you very much for the question being a former town counselor and being very familiar with the budgeting process at the local level I think your suggestion is appropriate I don't think we should be blindsiding communities with the new law.

82
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
That could dramatically impact budget discussions, depending whether you're an SB1 town or an SB2 town.

83
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.500
You want to make sure that it gets vetted and that the budgets get vetted appropriately amongst the voters.

84
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:28.000
So I think it's a salient point, and I would hope that the committee might address that so that we're giving our municipalities the opportunity to, should the law be passed and signed into law, be given opportunity to prepare for that thank you for the question thank you very much further representative mullin thank you mr.

85
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:54.500
chair and thank you representative boyd i'm over here on the other side of the speaker good to see representative mullin yes thank you you as well um as you know this bill is near and dear to me House Bill 1558 was Representative Murphy's bill, and I was a co-sponsor on that.

86
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.500
Thank you.

87
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:14.500
The last time that we dealt with this issue, one of the concerns that some of the school personnel had was about this aspect of the end of the school year versus the actual birth date.

88
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:22.500
I mean, we heard arguments about pushing it out a year isn't going to accomplish anything.

89
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.500
It's going to be another disrupted school year either way.

90
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:42.000
And we also heard a lot about school districts, some school districts, allowing students to stay in school until the end of the year in which they turn 21.

91
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Would you object to that being taken into consideration as opposed to going to the age of 22?

92
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
No, I wouldn't object.

93
00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I think it's important that we recognize for children with disabilities, and I alluded to this previously as it relates to addressing Representative Litchfield's question, I think it's important that we give municipalities the flexibility to be able to design how that student is going to wrap up their curriculum career at the high school level.

94
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So I think while that's something I had not contemplated, sitting here and listening to this for the first time, it certainly is not an unreasonable thing to consider if it's the desire of the Education Committee to address the issue, but add further language in there to clarify and, again, to use the word flexibility to give municipalities the flexibility to be able to plan and prepare for it.

95
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Thank you.

96
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Thank you.

97
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Thank you.

98
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Are there further questions?

99
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Not seeing any hands.

100
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Thank you very much.

101
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Mr.

102
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Chairman, thank you and to the committee for your time.

103
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I appreciate it.

104
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Thank you.

105
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:34.500
The next person to be called is Chris Biso, and I am here as a member of the NHA-SEA Legislative Committee, which is the New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators.

106
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:42.000
I also serve as a special education director for the Mascoma Valley Regional School District.

107
00:17:42.000 --> 00:19:20.500
I previously served in this capacity as well for the claremont school district i am here in in opposition of h bill 1513 as it's currently proposed and i think listening to um um the the gentleman previously here i think that we're all in agreement that I really the spirit of the law I think we all want more services for kids I think we all want what's best for kids and as Representative Litchfield brought up, sort of the main barrier at this point is sort of cleaning up some of the language and and and at this time if this goes into effect what the impact will be directly on school districts across the state in terms of the current budget cycle that we're that we're in and school district budgets are created in the fall and they go through a process and then they get to the to the town vote in in early March that process has already happened for next year so if this if this bill goes into effect it will have for some districts it will have a a significant impact on unbudgeted items that we haven't considered yet.

108
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:39.500
So that's really sort of the other piece, I think, is as we work with kids and we get them ready for transition, there is a lot of groundwork that happens between the school district and area agencies.

109
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:52.000
And there's a cross-section of work that happens in getting those kids ready to sort of transition into adult life where area agencies take over.

110
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So I think there should be, as we're looking at this, a better clarity as to sort of what that intersection is between when school districts are working with area agencies and how area agencies are actually budgeting for kiddos when they turn 21 and area agencies sort of take over that.

111
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And I'm not an expert in area agencies and how their budgets work, but I would like there to be a little bit more clarity in terms of what that might look like, especially if the majority of services that are happening at the area agency level at that point are Medicaid-driven.

112
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So I think that there should be a – if we look a little bit closer at that.

113
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.500
There are a couple of other things.

114
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:52.500
As we look at – we're not only talking about sort of kids who – if you look at the ramifications for kids who are in out-of-district placements, and if there's a huge significant impact on school budgets for next year for those kids who would ultimately stay in those out-of-district placements which can range anywhere from 350 to 500 thousand dollars per child and and then you're only you're only talking about those kids you're talking about kids who who are not in out-of-district placements, but who are still retained and educated in their local school, ages 18 to 21, and how to appropriately budget for them for the extra year.

115
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.000
There will be transportation costs.

116
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
There's OT, PT-related services, all of those things.

117
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.500
So, again, I think that we're all in agreement with the spirit of the law.

118
00:22:06.500 --> 00:23:25.500
It's how we at least get out ahead of it so we have enough appropriate time to be able to budget for it and again those those budgeting things have already happened for 22 23 so um it would put some school district my particular school district i think we'd be able to figure it out we'd be okay i think i would only be impacted maybe by about a hundred thousand or so um some other school districts that i work very closely with several kids kids in out of district placements where it would well run them a significant amount of money because they didn't have enough leeway to be able to better prepare for this um i can leave my testimony you know i had a written statement but i just really wanted to come and just kind of speak from the heart of how this will – we all want more services for kids.

119
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.000
There's no doubt about it.

120
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:42.500
But I think I'd like to see a little bit more preparation so districts are well prepared to sort of be able to handle the budget impact on that.

121
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.000
And I'd be happy to take that.

122
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.500
Thank you very much for coming today.

123
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.500
I do have a question then.

124
00:23:52.500 --> 00:24:04.000
Are you then thinking that it may be wise to put the effective date of this off for FY24, effective July 1, 2023?

125
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
I think, yes, I think so for sure.

126
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Because, again, the budget season has already passed for all school districts.

127
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Everything's been done.

128
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.500
Committees have voted on it.

129
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.000
It goes to town votes in March.

130
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And so there's really not enough time to sort of unwind, if you will, to include that for...

131
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Thank you.

132
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Are there other questions from the committee here right now?

133
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.500
Representative Luno, did you have...

134
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.500
Sure.

135
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

136
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.500
Chair, and thank you very much, Chris, for taking my question.

137
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.500
Would the effective date also impact the state's appropriation for the special education grant?

138
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.500
It probably would, yes.

139
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.500
Yeah, for sure.

140
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.500
How specifically?

141
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:12.000
I would want a little bit more guidance from the New Hampshire Department of Education on that.

142
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Yeah, for sure.

143
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:28.500
There's only a finite pool of money that is – and it would get further distributed after we start to include this group of kiddos in for another year.

144
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.000
And again, I think it's probably within our culture.

145
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
We've got enough money to sort of spread it around.

146
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
It's how it ultimately gets allocated and at what level and who is responsible.

147
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So I don't want people to think that this is not about getting services for kids.

148
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I think we're all in agreement that we want services for kids.

149
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:16.000
But things will be impacted, and probably in a negative way, if this goes into effect for this July 1st, without giving us a proper notification to be able to budget for such things.

150
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.500
So just a quick follow-up on that.

151
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:51.000
So pushing this to FY24, as the Chair has suggested, would also push the beginning of this policy into the next, the's next budget cycle which would then be able to consider the additional resources necessary within the special education grant which is formerly known as the catastrophic program and these are specifically for some of the student counts that you were referencing.

152
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
That is correct.

153
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Okay.

154
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Thank you very much.

155
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Thank you very much.

156
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Representative Mullen.

157
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Thank you, Mr.

158
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.500
Chair, and thank you, Chris, for taking my question.

159
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.000
My question has to do with the budgeting process.

160
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:43.000
When you are budgeting for students that have a large amount of tuition money designated to them when you're budgeting can I assume or am I correct in assuming that you take into account the entire year's tuition or residential costs when you're budgeting let me let me clarify it for you okay so if a student is turning 21 Thank you.

161
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:58.000
So if a student is turning 21 in November, when you're budgeting for that upcoming school year, are you budgeting for that student until November or through that school year?

162
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.500
If they're in an out-of-district place, we are budgeting until November.

163
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500
Okay.

164
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:14.000
So there would be, regardless of whether it's 21 or 22, you're budgeting to the birth date.

165
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
To the birth date.

166
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Okay.

167
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Thank you very much.

168
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Thank you.

169
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Representative Ford.

170
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Morning, Mr.

171
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Ford.

172
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.500
Got to remember that thing.

173
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:44.000
I wonder if the eligibility question might be resolved by redefining it to make the student eligible throughout the school year in which the student turns 21.

174
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.500
Therefore, the eligibility is clear.

175
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.500
It runs the whole school year.

176
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:55.500
And then you don't get into this question of money or whatever.

177
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500
Thank you.

178
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.000
Therefore, the eligibility is clear.

179
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
It runs the whole school year.

180
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And then you don't get into this question of money or whatever.

181
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.500
And it enforces the issue, I admit.

182
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.500
But is that a possible resolution?

183
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.500
Could be.

184
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:23.000
It would have further budget implications for school districts, for sure.

185
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Sure.

186
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
But it would be written in there, right?

187
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
You're eligible throughout the year, so you don't exit until graduation day.

188
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Again, that could have a significant impact on a school district's budget where they're currently budgeting to their birth date.

189
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.500
Again, when you look at an out-of-district placement, that is not a court-placed residential placement.

190
00:29:52.500 --> 00:30:21.000
So if a school district is, let's say, footing the entire bill for that, where it's not a shared cost, it's not a 402 kid, the average cost these days for not a district placement if you can find one anywhere in this pandemic right now, is anywhere from $350 to half a million dollars per kid.

191
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:31.500
And so those budgets, when you're creating them, they are currently being budgeted for until their birthday, until they turn 21.

192
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:49.500
If you extend that out for the entire school year, somebody who turns, let's say, 22 now in October, you're budgeting for them for almost another year for them to be in an out-of-district placement too.

193
00:30:49.500 --> 00:31:15.000
So I think there needs to be some language clarity around what that ultimately looks like and ultimately what kind of an impact that we'll have on a small community who for one or two kids who are in an out-of-district placement will have a significant impact on a small community.

194
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Thank you.

195
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Are there further questions?

196
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
I thank you for making the trip here today and providing us that insight.

197
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.500
We will call next from the Disability Rights Center.

198
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:41.000
We have Mike Skibbe and Karen Rosenberg is now stepping in in a transitional mode, so both will come forward together.

199
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Thank you.

200
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Here we go.

201
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Thank you.

202
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Good morning.

203
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.500
As Representative Ladd said, I'm Karen Rosenberg, new policy director at the Disability Rights Center.

204
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:04.000
I'm with Mike Skibbe, my soon-to-be predecessor, to testify in support of House Bill 1558.

205
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Excuse me, 1513.

206
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.500
I've got the wrong one in front of me.

207
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500
Thank you.

208
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.500
This is why I need him.

209
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:35.000
So, as Representative Boyle explained, this would be a change in our current law to extend eligibility for students with disabilities who are not able to obtain a diploma until throughout their 21st year, so until their 22nd birthday.

210
00:32:35.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And as you've also heard, this would bring New Hampshire's law in line with federal requirements under the individuals with disabilities Education Act I've provided one of my handouts for you the third one is a summary of how how ideas law applies in New Hampshire which I hope you find helpful.

211
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:13.500
So as you are also aware, this committee unanimously passed a similar, actually identical, bill two years ago, or voted that it ought to pass.

212
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.500
And unfortunately, it didn't make it to the finish line.

213
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:52.500
And it's unfortunate because extending eligibility to comply with our federal requirement is really important to a significant but small number of students with significant disabilities who need these services in order to perhaps earn they need the extended services to perhaps earn a high school diploma and definitely to be able to achieve as much as they can to be independent, fully participating members of our community.

214
00:33:52.500 --> 00:34:36.500
So, I mean, the kinds of cases that I've seen as a staff attorney at Disability Rights Center include kids getting kicked out of school before they've had an opportunity to really do things like job coaching and have employment internships and really get through programs that would help them to live more independently like cleaning and cooking some people who could really improve on their communication skills and that extra year can be very meaningful and to their success as adults when they are done with school.

215
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:51.500
And I think it was perhaps, I can't remember, maybe it was Representative Ladd or maybe Cordelli who asked about the schools, the states and what other state laws are.

216
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.500
I think it was Representative Cordelli.

217
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
So the answer is...

218
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:04.500
or maybe Cordelli who asked about the schools, the states, and what other state laws are.

219
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.000
I think it was you, Representative Cordelli.

220
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:20.000
So the answer to your question is that there are about 30 states that have already done this, and that includes states like Alaska.

221
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Let's see if I can leave a little list here Hawaii, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana North Carolina, Maine as far as the question about end of the school year and what that means some states have extended the eligibility to include the end of the school year in which a student turns 22.

222
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Some have not.

223
00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Some have created sort of a permissive policy where states that want to make that an option for school districts can so that those students could stay in school through the end of the school year in which they're 22.

224
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.500
A couple states, interestingly, West Virginia and Michigan actually extended eligibility to ages 23 and 25, respectively.

225
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.500
I don't see us doing that anytime soon.

226
00:36:20.500 --> 00:37:00.500
But the point is that extending eligibility to comport with our federal requirements would be extremely beneficial, but it also doesn't require students who have not earned their diplomas to stay in school until they turn 22 so for students who are really attached to the school building and the school culture they might it might be meaningful for them to graduate before they turn 22 to have that experience of graduation at the same time that other students graduate.

227
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:16.000
But what we see with a lot of older students who are not going to earn a high school diploma, these students are not necessarily as attached to the brick-and-mortar school.

228
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.500
Their programs are more in the community.

229
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:30.500
They are doing job shadowing and internships and learning how to go grocery shopping and navigate public transportation, those kinds of things.

230
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:40.500
So it's just not as meaningful to them necessarily to be in school through the end of the school year.

231
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.500
Doing what this bill says would provide an option for those students.

232
00:37:46.500 --> 00:38:28.500
So if they really could benefit from extended occupational therapy and job coaching and all of those things, they'd be able to do it until they turn 22 if they're more attached to the school and it's more meaningful for them to graduate or exit school earlier they could do that it's not mandatory um there there is a cost here um but it's it's it's not huge when you consider that most students with disabilities will graduate with a regular high school diploma.

233
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:35.000
The overwhelming majority will, and they'll do it way before they turn 21.

234
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:47.000
There is special ed aid, formerly known as CAT aid, available to school districts when they have really high-cost placements that they're dealing with.

235
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:56.500
So that runs through the Department of Education when costs exceed three-and-a-half times the average cost of an education.

236
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.500
So that's available.

237
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:13.000
There's also Medicaid to schools funding that helps for students that are Medicaid-eligible for schools to defray the cost of services like physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language services.

238
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:25.000
So for all these reasons, I really hope that the committee will vote ought to pass unanimously like it did before on this bill.

239
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I'm happy to take any questions.

240
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Thank you very much.

241
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Are there questions from the committee?

242
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Yes, one question.

243
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Thank you.

244
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.500
Do you know what happens now without the 21 inclusive language at birth date 21?

245
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:55.500
Do most districts end services for that child when they turn 21, or is it a mix of ending or continuing services?

246
00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.500
So I don't think that I have not done a scientific survey of this.

247
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:08.000
And unfortunately, people only call my office when they're unhappy, right?

248
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.500
No one wants to talk to a lawyer to say everything's going swimmingly.

249
00:40:14.500 --> 00:42:15.500
So I, over the course of my 16 years or so representing students, have had a number of cases where students are going're going to be 21 and they're they're booted out and it doesn't matter if it's october april i think i had one recently who um his birthday was in either it was either may or the beginning of june um a couple weeks ahead of the end so my my survey is very unscientific but i would say it happens regularly thank thank you very much and we do have the department here uh and we can get that type of information because hhs start stepping in we have medicaid uh and of course that medicaid of schools is administered through hhs via well directly to the school so that's a question which we can ask a lawyer along with the DD wait list and all that so with that are there's no more questions we'll take the next person and that would be technical assistance from the Department of Education I know there have been several questions raised so could we have that assistance then we have one more testifier after that to start with could you just introduce your name thank you chairman my name is Rebecca Fredette I'm the state director of special education thank you very much Rebecca Rebecca could you just give a brief capsule what happens when the Thank you very much, Rebecca.

250
00:42:15.500 --> 00:43:13.500
Rebecca, could you just give a brief capsule of what happens when the students do transition into life from school regarding maybe what you do with HHS to capture the services that are being provided within the school district and transition into the rest of their lives sure so transition can happen anytime from the age of 18 up to 21 at this point so there are students who will leave at the age of 18 they graduate with their class they move on with their class and but before that districts are working with area agencies to develop plans to develop procedures that would happen after the student graduates so that those things Thank you.

251
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:28.000
But before that, districts are working with area agencies to develop plans, to develop procedures that would happen after the student graduates so that those things are in place.

252
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:44.500
Having worked with DHHS, I know they have a – when they budget, they need an entire year to be able to budget for a student once they have exited the school system.

253
00:43:44.500 --> 00:44:08.500
So our work has been, over the last two years, to work with DHHS and the districts to say, please work with these students and the area agencies a year ahead of time to get all of the things they're going to need when they leave in place.

254
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:16.500
So at any point between 18 and 21, those things are going on in the schools.

255
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.000
They should be going on.

256
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Districts are meeting with area agencies.

257
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Parents are meeting with area agencies.

258
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.500
They're making a transition plan.

259
00:44:27.500 --> 00:45:25.000
they're developing services for transitioning out and then dhhs is starting to plan for them stepping into those services thank you and i have one more before i'll release to the committee um there's a fiscal note attached to this and i i assume that came from DOE the it says for the informational purposes department is provided that an approved private provider of special education ranges from 22 grand to 140 I'm just rounding the numbers up thousand dollars is that just the state money I know that when we're talking CAD aid, the total package can be, as we've heard earlier, $350,000 and higher, and a lot of smaller towns have seen that.

260
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.500
So are we just talking state money here and not locally appropriated dollars?

261
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.500
Right.

262
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:41.000
So those numbers are for our New Hampshire-approved special education, private providers of special education.

263
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:53.500
Currently, all of the New Hampshire programs have a tuition rate between those numbers that you just quoted, I believe, $22,000 and $140,000 per year.

264
00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:06.000
However, if you have a student that goes out of state, those costs increase, and there are schools that go up into the $400,000 range.

265
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:18.000
In-state right now, we only go up to about $140,000 per year for a student in one of the private providers of special education.

266
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.500
So to follow up, is that the money which is on top of other words?

267
00:46:25.500 --> 00:47:36.000
We pay our three-and-a-half times per student, and then we go into the 80% range and then 100% when you get 10 10 times are you talking about the total package of the state but excluding the dollars that are appropriated locally for their share up to that 10 times per average student cost so that so what the 22 to the 140 is the educational rate that we set for private providers aside from that when we do special education aid the district could come to us and say we are looking for the 140 000 that you that we paid for the student to go to one of these schools we're looking for the paraprofessional that we had to pay for to go to this school we're looking for the transportation we needed to provide the occupational therapy so.

268
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:50.500
So then you total that, and that's when we get into the three times and the ten times the amount that we're going to pay for special education aid.

269
00:47:50.500 --> 00:48:03.000
So we would take all of those, and we would make sure that they're all qualifying costs, and then the district would pay their portion.

270
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Then we would reimburse up to that 10%, and then we would pay the full bill after that.

271
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.500
So it's all of those costs kind of lumped together, and then we total it.

272
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.000
Yeah, it's a cumulative cost.

273
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Thank you.

274
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Questions from the committee?

275
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Yes, Representative Ford.

276
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Thank you, Mr.

277
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Chair.

278
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:45.500
I'm wondering about the circumstance in which a family moves into a town, and they have several children, one of whom fits this category we're discussing now.

279
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:52.000
What happens when you haven't had all that lead time to hook up?

280
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
How do you handle the trouble?

281
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Sometimes districts, there's a couple of ways that districts have handled that.

282
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.500
Some of them will adjust their budgets to pay for it through their local budgets.

283
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:13.000
Some of them will apply for special education aid.

284
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.500
And we will allow districts to write on their IDEA grants.

285
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:26.500
So each year we allot an amount from IDEA that we receive from the federal government.

286
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:41.000
And so on cases like that, we would allow them a one-time of writing on that grant to pay for that because they weren't able to budget for it.

287
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
So there are a couple of options that they have.

288
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It still is an impact on the district because it wasn't something that they budgeted for, Thank you.

289
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:11.000
There is also, and I don't know the bill, the law, but there is a provision that they could also apply to the Department of Education for, I believe it's emergency funds.

290
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:32.500
It was in one of the bills we did last year, and I just can't remember the number of the bill, where they could apply to us for emergency funds, and if we have it available, we could also assist them that way.

291
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.500
Thank you.

292
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.500
You're welcome.

293
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.500
Thank you very much.

294
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.000
Are there further questions, technical type questions?

295
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Not seeing any.

296
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Thank you very much.

297
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:55.500
And I just did want to clarify one question someone had asked about the impact on special education aid.

298
00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:05.500
There would be an impact on special education aid because currently we only provide special education aid up to 21.

299
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:13.500
So once a student has turned 21, any costs after that, because we're following state law.

300
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:23.000
So if the law were to change, we would then need to provide special education aid up to 22.

301
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So in follow-up to that, so then changing the effective date of this legislation would better prepare you to put these costs in your operational request?

302
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Yeah.

303
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Thank you.

304
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Thank you.

305
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Mariah Ryan.

306
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Good morning, Mr.

307
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Chairman and fellow Education Committee members.

308
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.500
My name is Maura Ryan, and I'm a parent.

309
00:51:53.500 --> 00:52:08.500
Originally, Darlene Cody Gildersleeve was supposed to come in and speak to this bill, but she's not feeling well, so I'm just going to make a couple of statements here.

310
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:14.000
Right now, the federal law is up to the 22nd birthday.

311
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.000
This is taught both by Wright's Law and the Parent Information Center.

312
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:35.500
When parents go and try to enforce their rights and get their child to stay in school to attain college and career-ready skills, they're denied by citations of the state law.

313
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:46.500
Once again, under the Supremacy Clause, if the federal law gives the greater benefit, that's the one that's supposed to be followed.

314
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:53.000
This was actually taken to the New England District Court, the federal court.

315
00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:11.500
It was a Rhode Island court case in which Judge Leipzig said that we cannot have multiple states defining what public education, when public education should end, otherwise we will have to different interpretations of the law.

316
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:19.500
He reinforced the fact that school districts are supposed to retain students through their 22nd birthday.

317
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:30.000
That court case actually came out in 2018, and schools have known about this since 2018 because it was widely publicized.

318
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:42.500
Right now, any special education student who remains in school would still be eligible for IDEA funding, would still be eligible for Medicaid to schools.

319
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.000
Those things are based off their attendance in school.

320
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:59.500
The number of children also who stay in school past the age of 21 is less than 3% of the total of all IEP kids.

321
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.000
And it does have a financial impact.

322
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.500
However, it's less than a rounding error in a school district budget in some cases.

323
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:19.000
And in many cases, the cost of AstroTurf is higher than the cost of the child's education.

324
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.500
My personal opinion is that life is more important than AstroTurf, but not everybody feels that way.

325
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:53.000
It also affects the future of the student and the future of our state, because if kids are not college or career ready, and they're not ready to live independently, which is what the crux of IDEA is supposed to support, then they're not able to contribute in our society effectively.

326
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.500
They won't be paying taxes.

327
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.500
They won't be working.

328
00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:04.500
They won't be doing much of anything because they don't have the skills yet.

329
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:17.500
And unless their parents can afford to pay for a private place for them to get that training, which most can't, you know, it's a problem.

330
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:30.000
In many cases, this comes down to what, you know, right now schools, they have ESSER funds coming in, they have ARP funds coming in.

331
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
20% of that is supposed to be designated for students with disabilities.

332
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000
And yet, no plan is in place in a number of districts.

333
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.500
What it comes down to for school districts is risk management.

334
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.000
Can the parents sue us?

335
00:55:50.000 --> 00:57:03.500
If they can't sue us, then we don't have to act act but I ask you to act because the federal law says it is through the 22nd birthday and those kids deserve to have the opportunity to have meaningful lives so I'm here to support this bill there are other parents who support this bill there are many children who've been denied staying through their 22nd birthday well not many but some who really needed the help so I am here to support and I would be willing to take any questions thank you very much are there questions for Mariah Ryan not seeing any hands thank you very much for coming today with that we have no more pink cards up here so I'm going to close this hearing and we will reopen the next hearing at 10 o'clock yes yep thank you Thank you.

336
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.500
They claim...

337
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.500
Thank you.

338
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.500
Thank you.

339
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.500
Thank you.

340
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.500
Thank you.

341
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.500
Thank you.

342
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.500
Thank you.

343
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.500
Thank you.

344
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.500
Thank you.

345
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.500
Thank you.

346
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.500
Thank you.

347
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500
Thank you.

348
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.500
Thank you, Mr.

349
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.500
Chairman and members of the committee.

350
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:39.000
I'm introducing this bill 1421 relative to lead in the school drinking water.

351
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.500
The prime sponsor is not here, so this is just done to start the roll.

352
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.500
Thank you.

353
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.500
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.

354
00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.500
I'm Brandon Kernan.

355
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.500
I work for the Department of Environmental Services.

356
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:15.000
I'm the administrator of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau, who right now administers the aspects of the Safe Drinking Water Act that require schools and child care facilities to test for lead.

357
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:38.500
I'm here today with a couple of colleagues from DES that actually manage the program day to day, Leon Atwell and Cindy Clevens, and as well as there's colleagues from Department of Education and Health and Human Services who are involved with schools and child care facilities.

358
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.500
We have questions, detailed questions on those things.

359
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:54.000
I did hand out a letter, and we submitted one electronically yesterday, and our letter just wants to make a few key points.

360
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
This bill would add provisions to Thank you.

361
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:09.500
I did hand out a letter, and we submitted one electronically yesterday, and our letter just wants to make a few key points.

362
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:25.000
This bill would add provisions to the Safe Drinking Water Act that would clarify some notification requirements to parents when child care facilities and schools have exceedances of standards for lead.

363
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
It also adds language to the existing statute that would have enforcement.

364
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
We provide enforcement capabilities.

365
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.500
Our letter just wants to provide the committee with some considerations as they look at this bill.

366
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:53.500
And the considerations that we offer in this letter have already been incorporated to a very similar bill in the Senate, Senate Bill 452.

367
00:59:53.500 --> 01:00:13.000
So we were successful in working with the prime sponsor to put some changes to the initial proposal into that bill, but we were not able to connect with the prime sponsor for this bill to do the same.

368
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So some of the considerations that we offer are, one, to change the statute that's referenced in the proposed language for enforcement.

369
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.500
Right now it's talking about polluting a water supply.

370
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:45.500
There's a more applicable reference that could be used that is typical of how we enforce the Safe Drinking Water Act that would provide finding authority for not falling through with the requirements statute.

371
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:53.500
I will say while that finding authority exists in statute, at the department we do enforcement.

372
01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:01.500
We do a lot of outreach, a lot of letters of warning, deficiency, timeframes to comply.

373
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:15.500
Finding's a very rare event at the agency, but at the end it is a red line that we can use if someone's going to simply not comply.

374
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500
That's one consideration.

375
01:01:17.500 --> 01:02:01.500
Another is that we suggest the statute include language such as some spill 452 to require that the facilities submit the results des just not collect the samples but actually submit the results it would help us administer the provisions better having that requirement and also where a facility finds an exceedance of a of a of a lead standard and they mitigate that fixture to resolve the issue that they have to sample and provide results after they mitigate that fixture so we know that it works.

376
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Another suggestion we provide in our letter is changing the timeframe that the three rounds of sampling has to occur.

377
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:21.000
The agency has in hand substantial grants from EPA for specifically addressing lead in schools and child care facilities.

378
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
At this time, the grant dollars have to be used by sometime in 2024.

379
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's possible that's going to change.

380
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:53.500
We originally were led to believe there's no additional funding coming down the pipeline from EPA, but we now know that there has been funding authorized in the infrastructure bill for additional sampling of school and child care facilities, but it hasn't been appropriated yet.

381
01:02:53.500 --> 01:03:06.500
That would be in the regular federal budget, which is under continuing resolutions right now, but it looks like there will be money in the future.

382
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:24.000
So we do propose a time frame now based on the money we know we have that we can give the schools to help comply with the sampling requirements to pay for the sampling costs.

383
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:36.500
And it may be at some point in the future we could even tweak that if we get additional funding to give schools more time.

384
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.000
There is a fiscal note attached to the bill.

385
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Obviously, there's a lot of effort to administer the requirements.

386
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:58.000
There's about 1,500 facilities that have to complete the sampling, and it's a fixture, it's just not their water source coming into the building.

387
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Again, we have federal grants for a couple years that we'll be able to cover the position at DES to administer it.

388
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:25.000
After two years, as I just explained, we don't know if we'll have funding or not, but that might be cleared up later this year when the federal budget is presumably passed.

389
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.500
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

390
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500
Thank you, Barry.

391
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:37.000
I have one question, and then we'll turn it over to the committee.

392
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I've been a water commissioner up in Haverhill, and we've had notices from DES that we've had to clean it up every now and then, or we're dropping below a limit we should be.

393
01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:04.000
A notification goes out to the community, all those on the line, that here's what you got in your water.

394
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Now addressing our schools, and as a school administrator, I've been to districts where we have had water which is not at the level we wanted.

395
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
It was in another state, however.

396
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm curious to know how does that occur?

397
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.500
How is it identified in this state?

398
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.000
Is it up to the local school?

399
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Or is it contracted out with somebody that has the certification to do that?

400
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And then how is the results of that communicated to all the parents and to the public in that school district's area?

401
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.500
So there's a couple situations.

402
01:05:51.500 --> 01:06:15.500
If the school is a customer of a water system, like connected to a town water system, and the town water system has unacceptable results, the water system has to provide the school notices and extra copies of the notices to distribute to the community at the school.

403
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:26.500
And I've seen that in practice where it goes out to parents in newsletters or emails and to staff in their mailboxes.

404
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:37.500
If the school has its own standalone water system with its own well, that has to be operated by a certified operator.

405
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:47.000
And that could be somebody that district employs that sends away for the training and they pass the test.

406
01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:06.500
Or they can contract that out to a certified operator, and that could be somebody that district employs that sends away for the training and they pass the test, or they can contract that out to a contract operator.

407
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:29.000
And if they have exceedances, they have to notify the people in the school that are drinking the water and also post it in an obvious place where you put notices about the water quality violation and steps that are being taken to mitigate it.

408
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Thank you.

409
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:54.500
Questions from the committee representative mullin thank you mr chair and thank you for taking my question i'm looking at the added language at the end of the bill that indicates that penalties would be levied under rsa 485 17 for failure to comply with the testing.

410
01:07:54.500 --> 01:08:07.500
And I'm looking at 485.17 where Section 1 talks about something being considered to be a misdemeanor if there's unintentional dumping of lead materials or whatever.

411
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.000
Section B is a Class B felony.

412
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Is there someplace where, am I missing something, is there some place where penalties are spelled out, what the penalties would be for this?

413
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:37.500
One of our recommendations in our letter, the third paragraph, and I know I just handed it out to you, suggests swapping out that proposed reference with RSA 4558.

414
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
That's more applicable.

415
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:48.000
And that essentially gets you to fines if you fail to comply after several iterations of warning.

416
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.500
So we don't think that's an appropriate reference as proposed, but this change would be...

417
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
Terrific.

418
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.000
So this would need to be amended?

419
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.500
Yes, we would recommend that.

420
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
Okay.

421
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
Thank you very much.

422
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Further question?

423
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
Representative Ford?

424
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:16.000
At one point in my life, I studied geology.

425
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:27.500
And I'm wondering when I read this bill and its specificity, given that that's laudable, there are other contaminants for which you check.

426
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:38.000
And I'm wondering if the language of this bill needs to be expanded in a way to cover all the contaminants.

427
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You're exactly right.

428
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:51.500
There's several dozen contaminants that we regulate at DES for public water systems, and we regulate them at different points in the system.

429
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.000
Many contaminants are environmental contaminants.

430
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.500
They do not come from plumbing systems or the distribution system.

431
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:07.000
And in those cases, we can sample the water at the source, at the well.

432
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:26.000
When you come to lead, though, that can be a localized source of contamination, a plumbing system in the building or the fixture itself, such that you need to actually test every place someone could get drinking water.

433
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:46.500
So you're right, there are other contaminants, they are addressed, but it's at the source, and it's a lot more feasible than going to every fixture, and there's no reason to, because some contaminants just wouldn't emanate from the plumbing system.

434
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500
Thank you.

435
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.000
Further questions for Representative Luno?

436
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

437
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
Chair.

438
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Thank you for being with us this morning.

439
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:11.000
Could you just speak really briefly to the difference in harm or the degree of harm caused by lead versus, let's say, arsenic?

440
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Wow, that's a tough one to pick because arsenic is quite toxic as well.

441
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Right, and prevalent in New Hampshire.

442
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Right.

443
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.500
Probably, I think both are serious concerns.

444
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.500
Long-term exposure to arsenic is more a concern than short-term.

445
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:40.500
The short-term exposure to lead can definitely adversely affect a child, and there's no safe level of lead.

446
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.000
And so it's really important.

447
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:51.500
And lead is more feasible to address down to very low levels than arsenic is as well.

448
01:11:51.500 --> 01:12:10.500
And so, you know, our standard for arsenic in New Hampshire is lower than most of the nation, five parts per billion instead of ten, and that's because it's a real concern with kidney cancer and other cancers.

449
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:18.500
Lead is equally as big of a concern, and that's why we are on parallel paths.

450
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.000
So it's not a hierarchy really there.

451
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.500
We're treating each one appropriately.

452
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:34.000
But you did actually indicate short-term versus long-term exposure gradient being sort of a difference between lead and arsenic.

453
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:47.500
Yes, we regulate arsenic based on a long-term exposure concern, and lead certainly could have an impact with a high-level exposure in a short period of time.

454
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500
Thank you.

455
01:12:49.500 --> 01:13:02.000
Arsenic based on a long-term exposure concern and lead certainly could have an impact with a high level exposure in a short period of time.

456
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Are there further questions?

457
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Thank you very much.

458
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Thank you.

459
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And we have Nancy Vaughn from the American Heart Association.

460
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Yes, thank you.

461
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Good morning, everyone.

462
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Nancy Vaughn, Government Relations Director for the American Heart Association.

463
01:13:22.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I've signed in neutral to the bill, but what I wanted to do was maybe provide some food for thought regarding remediation of contaminants and school drinking water one of the policies that we do support around the country and in New Hampshire we do have a bill in the Senate for this are the installations of fixtures known as water bottle filling stations and predominantly we are behind those because of the fact that it encourages children to drink more water which of course we want to do lead can be one of those issues that makes that a problem for schools to be able to provide children with with adequate water supplies so it's really just kind of a consideration I don't know if it's something that is already figured into a remediation plan for lead, but these devices, these units can actually filter out lead particles as well as other contaminants in water.

464
01:14:40.000 --> 01:15:00.500
So, again, just wanted to throw that out there as an idea of whether that could be something that helps with the remediation efforts should a school find that it has too much lead and other contaminants in their drinking water.

465
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.500
I'm happy to answer that question.

466
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Representative Porter.

467
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
Yes.

468
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
Thank you, Mr.

469
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.500
Chair, and thank you for taking this question.

470
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:28.500
Actually, I think you answered it in part of your – I know in Hillsboro, the town I represent, for years had a problem with lead in the drinking water.

471
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:38.000
At the elementary school, we had to run faucets before the kids came and all that sort of thing.

472
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Installing the water bottles, filling stations, I'm sure it's still there, it must be still there, because they haven't replaced the pipes.

473
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So those filling stations would eliminate the lead in their water if it was in there.

474
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I'm not a specialist or an expert in this area, and I don't know if it depends upon how much lead particles are in the drinking water, but it is something that definitely can filter out lead particles.

475
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Thank you.

476
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's helpful.

477
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.500
Thank you for your question.

478
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.500
Thank you very much.

479
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.000
Are there further questions from the committee?

480
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Not seeing any hints.

481
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Thank you very much thank you all right is there any are there any folks out there that wanted to talk that haven't that we're at the bottom of these particular cards right now not seeing anybody thank you very much we will close this hearing Thank you.

482
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:13.500
the well and into the aquifer and we had the truckloads of water to the school I was going to say thank you I've got to get a hold of his communication to us this is it right here.

483
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.500
Thank you.

484
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500
Thank you.

485
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500
Chairman?

486
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
Mm-hmm.

487
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.000
1671, the attic received bill.

488
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Yeah.

489
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
That's been...

490
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:37.500
Well, it was scheduled, and then that's gone, and we put it off because of Frank not writing around.

491
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.500
And the date yes Thank you.

492
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.500
Thank you.

493
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.500
Thank you.

494
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500
Thank you.

495
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500
Thank you.

496
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500
Thank you.

497
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.500
Thank you.

498
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.500
Thank you.

499
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.500
Thank you.

500
01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.500
Thank you.

501
01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.500
Thank you.

502
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.500
Thank you.

503
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Thank you.

504
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.500
Thank you.

505
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
Thank you.

506
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.500
Thank you.

507
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Thank you.

508
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
Thank you.

509
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500
Thank you.

510
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
Thank you.

511
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.500
Thank you.

512
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
Thank you.

513
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.500
Thank you.

514
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.500
Thank you.

515
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.500
Thank you.

516
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.500
Thank you.

517
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.500
Thank you.

518
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.500
Thank you.

519
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500
Thank you.

520
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.500
Thank you, Mr.

521
01:18:38.500 --> 01:19:16.000
Chairman and members of the Education Committee I my name for the record is Erica Leon and I represent Rockingham 6 which is dairy dairy is one of 10 sending schools to public academies in New Hampshire which is a large part of why this came to my attention so right right now, we have requirements for public academies for the chairperson of the trustees of an approved public academy to certify this financial report.

522
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.500
And we have penalties if it is not filed.

523
01:19:20.500 --> 01:20:30.500
But in the beginning of this this paragraph it doesn't specifically say that approved public academies need to file this it was an oversight in the language and this is just a simple housekeeping measure as it stands the current law says a financial report for each city school district and chartered public school shall be filed following the summary of receipts and expenditures according to classifications and then it puts that responsibility this amendment simply adds approved public academies into that first line which clarifies several other statutes throughout the the school money section it also adds the chair person of the board of trustees of a chartered public school because currently chartered public schools are required to fill this information out, but they don't have anybody who is the one who needs to sign under penalties of perjury.

524
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:37.000
So I apologize that I didn't bring this to everybody's attention last year.

525
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:46.500
Last year we passed HB 442, which added the requirement that there's some penalties if these are not filed.

526
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.000
It would have been a lot easier.

527
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:59.000
It wouldn't have taken as much time, and then you would have had one fewer bill this year.

528
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:13.500
But hopefully this will be a nice and easy correction to the statutes to make sure that it's consistent and clear and it provides more transparency to the taxpayers.

529
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:31.500
One of the challenges we face in Derry and in other sending schools is that they tell us the price of a stripped-down Corolla with roll-down windows, but fortunately, that is not the education we get.

530
01:21:31.500 --> 01:22:22.000
We get a much more robust education than just the very simple level that is priced out on that base education we have a tremendous number of special education students we have a tremendous number of great programs at Pinkerton and the same at the Co Brown and it would do a far better justice to our school board who needs to speak to the cost of Pinkerton and to our taxpayers to understand that yes, it might be $400 more expensive than Lendendary High School, but if we think that's worth it, and a lot of us do, that's good.

531
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.000
This simply brings transparency about where taxpayer money goes in order to pay for students' education.

532
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I'm happy to take any questions.

533
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Thank you.

534
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Are there any questions?

535
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yes, Representative Luno.

536
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

537
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:47.500
Chair, and thank you very much, Representative Leon, for bringing this forward.

538
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.000
Is this report also known as the DOE 25?

539
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Yes, it is.

540
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Thank you.

541
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You're welcome.

542
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Are there further questions?

543
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.500
I just have one just to make sure it's not required.

544
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:13.500
We have approved academies that are not in this state which New Hampshire students are attending.

545
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:19.000
The way it's written right now, it says an approved academy.

546
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
St.

547
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Johnsbury Academy is approved.

548
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.500
Is this applicable to them?

549
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:29.000
I can't see how it could be.

550
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:40.000
You know, they're not going to send a financial report to Concord, but to Mount Pillar, but it is an approved academy.

551
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.500
It says approved public academy.

552
01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:55.500
I would be happy to bring an amendment or have you bring an amendment to specify the statute which defines a public academy in our laws.

553
01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:02.500
It's clearly spelled out as the private institution which is contracted for these students.

554
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.500
And it's a very clear and tight definition.

555
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:13.000
So if that clarity would help this, I think that would be fantastic.

556
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It may help satisfy some people at the other end.

557
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:31.500
I know when we've dealt with that before, we have, from this state, approximately $1.5 million annually goes over to that academy by way of tuition students.

558
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:40.000
And it's important that we still have the availability to our New Hampshire students up that way.

559
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.500
And we don't want to mess up the system.

560
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500
Absolutely.

561
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:58.000
Would you like me to figure out that exact reference, write that down while the next person is testifying and then propose that?

562
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
What you could do, I don't know if it's necessary.

563
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It might be something we ask first to our own department to find out.

564
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.500
I just don't want any confusion here.

565
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:25.500
If it is necessary, perhaps we can just have something written real quickly and it can be handed off to somebody in the committee.

566
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500
That sounds fantastic.

567
01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:30.000
I'll figure out the line.

568
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And I've spoken with the Department of Education about this.

569
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.500
They believe that it looks to be required, but this clarification is something they support.

570
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:52.500
And I'll just make sure that we get it as specific as we can so that we aren't catching St.

571
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.000
Johnsbury Academy or any others in this.

572
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:08.500
I think right now the way it is, it's not going to be applicable to the academy up there, but there will be that fear.

573
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:16.000
When we're trying to clean things up, we should clean it up, so thank you.

574
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Thank you very much.

575
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Representative Luno.

576
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Thanks again, Mr.

577
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Chair, and thanks again for taking my question, but your discussion here opens up a couple of questions as well.

578
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So in the case where a school district has contracted with a non-public school, is that school district required to complete a DOE 25?

579
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:53.500
The school district completes the DOE 25, which ends up including the students that are sent to other ones.

580
01:26:53.500 --> 01:27:03.000
The Derry Cooperative School District is a K-8 school district, so they have their DOE 25 for the K-8.

581
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
They do not themselves educate any students in the 9-12.

582
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:36.500
They send students to special education placements, they send to next charter school, and they they send to pinkerton but because they do not have that information they they cannot and do not file for the 9 through 12s so follow up on on that specific with with dairy's contract with pinkerton for the 9 through 12.

583
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:50.000
so does that mean that the department does not receive data associated with the cost of education for dairy's student dairy's students in grades 9 through 12.

584
01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:12.500
when you look on the department of education website that part says non-applicable and i have no information no information that is within the department standards i was on fiscal advisory committee, and we actually have a school board member here as well to speak.

585
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:28.000
But that simply is the price that we get from Pinkerton, so we can back it out, but we can't report it in any consistent format with the Department of Education.

586
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And I guess a final, well, actually, are we going to hear from the department on this one?

587
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Well, the – Yeah, I do have a technical question on that.

588
01:28:43.000 --> 01:29:09.500
So just along the same lines as the Derry School District contracting with Pinkerton and not being able to complete a DOE 25 for students in grades 9 through 12, how would then a school district that contracts with a non-public school be able to complete a DOE 25 for the similar reasons?

589
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.000
That's a very good question.

590
01:29:12.000 --> 01:30:31.000
As I've gone through, I haven't found other ones that list NA for the high school years school years right right so i'm i'd like to direct that that question to um to um this event so thanks thank you okay are there any further questions of uh represent leon thank you very much thank you yep uh next uh card we have is Lynn Perkins good morning to all of you and thank you for entertaining this amendment I haven't been engaged with the education committee in about the last three years I was the chairman of the dairy school board at the time and through all the pandemic issues and whatnot I think it's probably taken it off of my specific radar I serve on the high school committee with the dairy cooperative school board or the school district school board and this has become something that's really become significant in in our to deal with.

591
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The significance of this bill has been that it's a contract requirement with Pinkerton as a sending district that they disclose and break down their budget in specificity.

592
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
It has been a rarity that Pinkerton has done this.

593
01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:24.500
They've only it on two occasions and on one of the occasions they didn't make the information relevant or acceptable accessible to our school board or our district that was in 2003 and the reason that information became highlighted was because during an annual audit, it was insisted that that information from Pinkerton be released, and it was information specific to bond payments interests in principle on bond payments.

594
01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:50.000
They released the information, but they released it directly to the auditors because they didn't want the public to see the information they released it directly the auditors because they didn't want the public to see the information it was released again in two thousand thirteen fourteen by the accountant uh...

595
01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:09.500
in our district did receive that information it has not been released again this is a contract year for dairy we negotiate every five years with pinkerton Pinkerton to decide whether or not to continue our agreement with Pinkerton.

596
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:35.500
this has been a couple of things that have been asked a couple of questions are significant to this contract which we're asking for now but one of them is release of the bond payments principle outstanding balances of all their bonds so that we can see where our costs are going.

597
01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:41.500
This is a private entity that has untapped access to public dollars.

598
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:52.000
And that's significant for dairy because we're finding that every year we are asking for information about long-range planning with Pinkerton.

599
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Their costs and improvements continue to grow while the student population continues to diminish.

600
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:15.500
And when we are trying to do our own long-range planning, perhaps looking ahead at what's down the road, what we should be looking at for expenditures, we can't get that information either.

601
01:33:15.500 --> 01:34:18.500
Specific to this bill would be that release of principal payments, interest payments on bonds, so that we can at least, if they're not going to give us a long-range plan, we can at least say, well, they've got this much money that they're going to have to be paying every year to justify their tuition costs to us but we can't even do that so in our contract year this year we are requiring that they give us that information to which point they are refusing to divulge those bond payments and interest on in principle on all their bonds I I think that the most part gives you an overview of why this is significant to dairy and also Chester, Auburn, Hampstead, and Hooksett.

602
01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.000
All are faced with the same circumstances.

603
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.500
So I'm willing to take any questions.

604
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:37.500
I may have lost my track of what I wanted to say in specificity, but I'm willing to take questions if I can help.

605
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

606
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Perkins.

607
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Are there questions?

608
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Yes, Representative Luno.

609
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Sure.

610
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Thanks very much, Mr.

611
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Chair.

612
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

613
01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.500
Perkins, for joining us this morning.

614
01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.500
You were formerly with the board.

615
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.500
Currently am, yes.

616
01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:08.500
I'm actually in my last, I have three scheduled meetings before re-elect.

617
01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500
Okay, all right, fantastic.

618
01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.500
Well, thank you for your service.

619
01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500
Thank you.

620
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:23.000
Do you receive any financial reports from Pinkerton, such as 990s or anything like that?

621
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.500
I can't speak to the specific form.

622
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:33.500
I can give you an example of what it is that we do receive.

623
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:38.500
I can actually leave it with you if you'd like.

624
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:58.000
But it just basically runs down what their costs are, what the CT program is, passes, resource rooms, NECC programs, which are, you know, NECC is probably specific to us, but it's an autistic-related program that supports a district.

625
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
We have general administration operations and maintenance instruction, instructional costs.

626
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:21.000
But like I said, the one form that I'm looking at right now is from 2013-14, and it says costs of new facilities, and it says board expense, bond principal and interest, land and building improvements.

627
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.500
We don't receive that last category broken down in that regard.

628
01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:39.500
So we have no idea what the actual amount of money is that they're having to borrow, and in fact charging back to the sending districts.

629
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:46.000
And it's been a frustration that all of the sending districts Thank you.

630
01:36:46.000 --> 01:37:17.500
is that they're having to borrow and in fact charging back to the sending districts and it's been a frustration that all of the sending districts have expressed in some level that's in at different times great thank you very much thank you further questions not seeing any thank you very much thank you very much for entertaining this do we have any?

631
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
So that's it.

632
01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:27.000
So we have no further cards on this, so we are going to close this.

633
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Go ahead.

634
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Oh, I thought you had done.

635
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Yeah, that's fine.

636
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Oh, okay.

637
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
You have additional.

638
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Representative Fenton, or Representative Senator, no, Attorney Fenton.

639
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.500
Today you're going to go all the way up the ramp.

640
01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Governor next, that's right.

641
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
Oh my gosh.

642
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:55.000
Representative Mullen, you just slow down there.

643
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.500
So I will have to get back to you.

644
01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500
No, that's fine.

645
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:12.500
I've got just a couple more along the lines of maybe what a public academy like Pinkerton and Coe Brown does file.

646
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:23.000
So I think I'd be interested, maybe the committee would be interested in learning more about what financial forms public academies.

647
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And I would go on to say non-public schools as well, certainly non-public schools that contract with school districts, what sort of financial reports they do need to file, both with the state and also with the Internal Revenue Service.

648
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:55.500
So why don't I type that up, and then you and I can talk during the break, and then we can get you that information.

649
01:38:55.500 --> 01:39:04.000
I just want to make sure that I have the information, the content that you're looking for.

650
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Great, great.

651
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
No, no, thanks.

652
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
And this is not an early bill, right?

653
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.500
It's not an early bill.

654
01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Yeah, so we've got a little bit of time to.

655
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.000
So are we talking here?

656
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.500
So my question is to the attorney, governor attorney.

657
01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:31.000
You're going to get me in so much trouble.

658
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.500
We have tuition programs allow K-8s to tuition to various types of schools.

659
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.000
We before tuition to Kimball Union, a private school.

660
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Is it your understanding that if we were to follow through on this request, we would be looking for everything that's on the DOE 25, that's assets, expenditures, and revenues?

661
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:04.500
That's my understanding of the bill, that it would make the DOE 25 equally applicable.

662
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.500
Thank you.

663
01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:14.000
That's my understanding of the bill, that it would make the DOE 25 equally applicable.

664
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.500
But that's a cursory understanding.

665
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:21.000
I don't have the bill in front of me.

666
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
So this would actually be good information, too.

667
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.500
So let's take KUA as an example.

668
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:38.500
Obviously, the number of students from public school districts probably is very small compared to the overall enrollment at KUA.

669
01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:54.000
So would they be completing a DOE 25 form only with respect to the students from school districts under contract, or would they be completing it for their entire student body?

670
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And I think that's important from New Hampshire's standpoint because we're interested in, obviously, the information about our students in public schools.

671
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Right.

672
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.500
I can understand the committee's question there.

673
01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:36.500
So, again, why don't I work on crafting that and then I can touch base during the break and get that information to the committee thank you fantastic thanks thank you are the further questions of attorney Fenton thank you very much thank you with that I'm going to close this hearing.

674
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:38.500
Ten minutes.

675
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:51.000
you know the the information you're giving to the, there is a closed date that's still going right now on submitting that list to us.

676
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So what we've got to do is clarify that report and say, as of this time.

677
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.500
What was the numbers on this one?

678
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:07.000
Four in support, zero in opposition, zero in neutral.

679
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.500
I do have a question.

680
01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.500
That's just the online registration, right?

681
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.500
Yes.

682
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.500
We have the blue sheets, too.

683
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:23.500
So, yeah, I'm just saying that we would need that plus that.

684
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500
Yes.

685
01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:30.500
In some committees, they read the blue sheets as well.

686
01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:36.500
Just wondered whether you were giving me the total or a piece.

687
01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.500
That's all.

688
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.500
Thank you.

689
01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:49.000
I'm not too excited about going in and auditing Holderness Academy or Holderness School or Kimball Union.

690
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
We're going to screw a lot of people.

691
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Thank you.

692
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.500
Anybody else has the information?

693
01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:04.500
They claim that it has to educate a big goal as $15,000 a year.

694
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:10.000
And they claim that it's $5,000 a month than other schools.

695
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But when you bring it in, it's about more than a month.

696
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So if you're doing an out-of-stout comparison, sure, we have a way better school.

697
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.500
And that's a convincing argument.

698
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:41.500
But when you're misleading people about the price, then that sets the towns up with other issues, and the school districts have a lot of issues, and just the lack of transparency.

699
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
I really subsidize that.

700
01:43:43.500 --> 01:44:11.500
My concern is important, especially because there's already accountability well yeah and so when they build a justification is lost but if they want to pay for it what was an explanation Pinkerton looks like a college if we weren't at a point of contraction of college yes very nice I didn't get involved Thank you.

701
01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:16.500
If we weren't at a point of contraction of health.

702
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.500
Yes.

703
01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.500
Very nice.

704
01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.000
I didn't get involved until we had a fight.

705
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I worked with the daughter of my husband.

706
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I was in the last one.

707
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I was in the last one.

708
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I was in the last one.

709
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I was in the last one.

710
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I was in the last one.

711
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I was in the last one.

712
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I was in the last one.

713
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I was in the last one.

714
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I was in the last one.

715
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I was in the last one.

716
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I was in the last one.

717
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I was in the last one.

718
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I was in the last one.

719
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I was in the last one.

720
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I was in the last one.

721
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I was in the last one.

722
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I was in the last one.

723
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I was in the last one.

724
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
.

725
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Thank you.

726
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
students enrollment, kids they're sending to some fines, they're paying over $30,000.

727
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
You didn't use it right now.

728
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.500
You think they sent it to you?

729
01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500
Wow.

730
01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
Wow.

731
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:50.000
I think in two years, maybe now, but it's a 20 year contract.

732
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
We have the department review it.

733
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Right now, unincorporated to elementary school.

734
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.500
They don't have elementary kids.

735
01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:02.500
They haven't sent any elementary kids here before.

736
01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.500
They want $25,000 for those two kids for elementary school.

737
01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:11.500
That's like a better business than I realized.

738
01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Yeah, right.

739
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500
I talked to people.

740
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:23.000
I wanted to start a charter school, but that's not getting those kinds of problems.

741
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I have a non-adventure.

742
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Next year, I'll talk to you.

743
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.500
I know that you remain versus shadow.

744
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
Thank you.

745
01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500
Yes.

746
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
Perfect.

747
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.500
And so we should be able to change from there.

748
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:52.000
And then the moment when I spoke with the HSO DA, I was just refining it a little bit.

749
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.500
So I'll give the reminders to you.

750
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500
Thank you.

751
01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:02.500
So the sponsors are from a bunch of different .

752
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:07.000
There was lots of support from all this .

753
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Thank you very much.

754
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Good to see you.

755
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
.

756
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
.

757
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
.

758
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Thank you.

759
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's felt the best.

760
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Thank you.

761
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I could use sausage, bacon, pancakes, everything right about now.

762
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Take out her?

763
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:49.500
Okay, we're ready to go ahead here with our next hearing for today, HB 1355, Requiring the scholarship organization to refer suspected cases of misuse of funds or fraud in the Education Freedom Account program to the Attorney General.

764
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.500
Welcome, Representative Luno.

765
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.500
Terrific.

766
01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

767
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Chair and members of the committee.

768
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.500
For the record, my name is Dave Luno, representing the people of Hopkinton and Concord.

769
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:13.500
House Bill 1355 is a straightforward bill, but it's a lot more than housekeeping.

770
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:21.000
It adds a word, it deletes a few words, but as we know, words matter.

771
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Truth matters, and children matter, and taxpayers expect that we are making sure that their taxpayer dollars matter and are used as intended by state law.

772
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:42.000
There's no doubt that the Education Freedom Account program laid out in RSA 194F was contentious.

773
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I didn't support it when we had it as part of House Bill 20.

774
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.000
In fact, thousands of people registered their objections, far outstripping those who registered support.

775
01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:12.000
And following public budget hearings where no one spoke in support of the EFA program, not one, over hundreds who spoke in opposition, it was hastily baked into the state budget anyways.

776
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So I'm here this morning not to repeal the program, at least not yet.

777
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Thanks for your laughter, Representative Cordelli.

778
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:30.500
I'm here to make this program better than it is today, and I really do mean that.

779
01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:46.500
I'm here to offer improvements to the EFA program for you to consider, and there will be more, but for right now, it's an improvement to address fraudulent use of EFA funds.

780
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:56.000
According to the DOE, the average EFA student is funded by the state to just about $5,000 every year.

781
01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:05.500
It's not quite enough to cover private school tuition in most cases, at least not without other financial assistance.

782
01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:15.000
And it's a good amount of money to help cover materials and other expenses for students and home schools.

783
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:28.500
And when the EFA money is spent on products and services as listed in the statute, things like tuition, textbooks, computers, and other education expenses, that's good.

784
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:34.500
But when the EFA money is used for other purposes, that's bad.

785
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:47.000
It's bad for the EFA student, it's bad for taxpayers who fund the EFA program, and it's bad for the reputation of the program itself.

786
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And there's another word for it.

787
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It's fraud.

788
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.500
And whether we believe it or not, it happens.

789
01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.500
So who cares?

790
01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.500
No harm, no foul.

791
01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500
Wrong.

792
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.500
Really wrong.

793
01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.000
Fraud harms all of us.

794
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Everyone is being taken advantage of.

795
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
But you know who feels it the most?

796
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
The kids.

797
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
The EFA students.

798
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:28.000
When the voucher money is not being spent on things listed in the statute, it could lead to real problems.

799
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Current events are hard to put aside, but it could be possible for EFA students to be taken advantage of in order to fraudulently pay for things that would never have been considered under state law.

800
01:51:46.000 --> 01:52:00.500
You can use your imagination, and it's easy to see how some expenses just have no positive contribution to a child's education or their well-being, may even cause harm.

801
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:14.500
Like I said, current events are hard to put aside, but some children are in environments where they might not encounter other adults and could be at risk.

802
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.000
We're all mandatory reporters, right?

803
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:40.500
What this simple bill does is make sure the private contractor, the scholarship organization that manages the EFA program, is responsible to students and taxpayers to make sure the EFA money is spent properly, and suspected cases of fraud are reported to the Attorney General for investigation.

804
01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:51.500
Let's protect students and taxpayers and put some accountability on the shoulders of the scholarship organization to report suspected cases of fraud.

805
01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:55.000
There's no teeth in the current law.

806
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Let's change that and protect kids and taxpayers.

807
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:14.500
It makes sense, unless the potential for fraud is just so remote, just so infinitesimal, and that it's just not worth even considering the possibility of the harm it could cause.

808
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:19.500
But please think about these kids and your taxpaying constituents.

809
01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.500
Thanks for your time.

810
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:24.500
I'd be happy to take questions.

811
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.500
Thank you very much.

812
01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500
Are there any questions?

813
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.500
Representative Cordelli.

814
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.500
Thank you, Mr.

815
01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:36.500
Chairman, and thank you for bringing this forward.

816
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:40.500
I agree with one word on it, anyway.

817
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:51.500
If you would believe, the May to a shall, I think, was an oversight in the Senate that I completely agree with.

818
01:53:51.500 --> 01:54:08.000
And actually, we will be hearing another bill in a couple of weeks, I think it's 1678, that tries to address some of the items that have been raised or questioned by JLCAR.

819
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:16.500
And I believe that this is on the list for that bill to be corrected as well.

820
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:23.500
Not so much in agreement on removal of three words, the intentional and substantial.

821
01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:36.500
would that open up the door for someone to call up and say, you know, I think that they spent this money on such and such?

822
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:45.500
And would that be required to be reported then to the Attorney General's office as a suspected fraud?

823
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.500
Thank you.

824
01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:55.000
be required to be reported then to the Attorney General's office as a suspected fraud.

825
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.500
Let me just take a quick note.

826
01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:02.000
So thank you very much, Representative Cordelli.

827
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I think that's an excellent question.

828
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:19.500
I think some additional words that were taken out are the words that would put the scholarship organization in a position where they would need to investigate the fraud.

829
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:30.500
As long as they could interpret substantial and intentional at face value, then I think we've got some common ground on this.

830
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.500
Thank you.

831
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:35.500
Are there further questions, Representative Lakers?

832
01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:54.500
Yes, I had wondered not only about that phrase, but if evidence of fraudulent uses of VFA funds is obtained, and you were talking about fraud being committed, you know, it would be if fraud was being committed.

833
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:59.000
So I'm wondering why you took that part out.

834
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Thanks very much for the question.

835
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:14.500
I took that out because that's what the role of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, would be to investigate and obtain the evidence.

836
01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:33.000
Just as what I was suggesting to Representative Cordelli, if the scholarship organization can make a sort of like a prima facie determination of fraud, of substantial and intentional fraud, then I think that should be sufficient.

837
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I think that could be sufficient.

838
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
We'll be right back.

839
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:45.500
determination of fraud, of substantial and intentional fraud, then I think that should be sufficient.

840
01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:55.000
I think that could be sufficient to then invoke the shall be referred to the Attorney General for investigation.

841
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Thank you.

842
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Thank you.

843
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Are there further questions?

844
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Not seeing any.

845
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Thank you very much.

846
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Great.

847
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Thank you very much.

848
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Okay.

849
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Where will we go?

850
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.500
We only had one card on that.

851
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.500
Mr.

852
01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.500
Chair?

853
01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.500
Mr.

854
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.500
Chair?

855
01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:35.000
Could I have either Senator or Representative or Governor Fenton come and just answer a question for me, a legal question.

856
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.500
I hadn't gotten there yet.

857
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:46.500
Is there anybody else in the public that did not submit a red card or a pink card?

858
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.500
Okay.

859
01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:53.500
Are you available for this from the department, attorney Fenton?

860
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500
Thank you.

861
01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.500
Welcome.

862
01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.500
Thank you.

863
01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:01.500
You have a question?

864
01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:04.000
Yes, I actually have two.

865
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
One is intentional, substantial, sound like legal terms to me.

866
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:17.500
And I was wondering if they are and if there are specific guidelines to intentional and substantial.

867
01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:23.000
I mean, it seems to me they're kind of objective terms.

868
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:52.500
And my other question is, kind of goes back to the appointment of a person at DOE to oversee the or to help administer the EFA program, whether that person would then also be able to report intentional substantial fraud as they might see it from their point of view, whether they'd be handling issues that might come up.

869
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.500
So thank you for the question.

870
01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:02.000
I know that the term intentional can be a legal term of art.

871
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:34.500
You'll see that mostly in the criminal law, although I'm sure it's used in other contexts as well substantial I wouldn't use that as a legal term I think it's subjective as to your other question if I understand it correctly it's could could this person who's overseeing the program at DOE, the program administrator, could Representative Luno's bill be part of their administrative duties?

872
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:37.500
Is that, in essence, your question?

873
01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:59.000
Would that be part and parcel of the role that person were to play so um it's my understanding i guess that uh the scholarship organization now has hired a third party group to issue debit cards type of situation is that right?

874
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:09.000
They have some way to distribute the money and then get the information back as to how it's being used.

875
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:17.500
And they would be in the ideal position to see if there was intentional or substantial abuse.

876
02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:37.000
So I'm wondering if in the mind of the people that are proposing to have this person at the DOE, if that person would also be in a position where they might actually come across intentional and substantial abuse.

877
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:49.500
I think it's very possible that they could come across that in their work, but I don't think that's the vision of that particular position.

878
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:56.000
That position is done to help families and to help administer the program.

879
02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:24.500
It's not necessarily to proactively identify fraud, but I think that that person could certainly, in that role, have the opportunity to identify that, and I would suspect that it would be handled appropriately throughout the channels at DOE, but I think it was clear in the testimony that that position is to be more of administrative.

880
02:01:24.500 --> 02:02:37.000
I think it's very similar to what we've seen with the charter school administrator, and so as part of that role in administering the charter school grants the department has had the very rare opportunity but it has happened to identify misappropriation of funds but in large part that that position is to help administer it in a positive way and to help that program be successful would that would that person have to be named in this particular bill in order to be in a position to report it or would that be just um kind of common practice that that person would that position would be a reporting physician I think it could be added to the list of job details that that person covers if this legislative body felt that was appropriate to do or that could be left to rulemaking perhaps.

881
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Okay, thank you.

882
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Thank you.

883
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Representative Mullen.

884
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.500
Attorney Fenton, if you wouldn't mind taking a seat.

885
02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.500
I was so close.

886
02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:51.500
Thank you, Mr.

887
02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:53.500
Chair.

888
02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:59.000
I thought you were a speaker, and that's why you're right.

889
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

890
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Chair, and thank you, Attorney Fenton, for taking my question.

891
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.500
Back to the phrase intentional and substantial.

892
02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:15.000
Is there a difference legally between and substantial and or substantial?

893
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:27.500
Because I'm looking at this and thinking that even a little bit of fraud is a problem, that it doesn't have to be substantial fraud.

894
02:03:27.500 --> 02:04:02.000
So in that phrase, would it be possible, Would it hold some sort of legal merit to have intentional and slash or substantial I think by adding the and or makes it broader certainly and you've identified that yourself I think in terms of statutory language and how it's written to to do the and or, and this is just my own personal preference, I think it looks sloppy.

895
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.500
And I think in terms of writing statutes, I would, again, encourage not to use that shorthand.

896
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:13.500
But that's really just personal preference.

897
02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:25.500
And I don't know, honestly, I think Jen, Jen, Jen, for my, sorry to call Jen out, but she's giving me a cross-eyed look.

898
02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:40.500
But in terms of kind of these legal questions, I don't know, I might be stepping outside of my lane just a little bit working for the Department of Education.

899
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:47.500
So I would probably defer to your legislative committee researcher on that particular question.

900
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.500
Okay.

901
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.500
Thank you very much.

902
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.500
Thank you very much.

903
02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:57.500
Are there any further questions of the department?

904
02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:01.000
Now, I'm saying thank you very much.

905
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Are there any other pink cards out there or requests?

906
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:14.000
For technical support, is there anybody who would like to address a technical question to the...

907
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Technical support from the scholarship organization?

908
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Okay, thank you.

909
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Come on up.

910
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Sorry about that.

911
02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Matt Southerton, Director of Policy and Compliance at the Children's Scholarship Fund.

912
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.500
I think you're dealing with a number of issues this morning.

913
02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:42.000
We have the bill, but then we have the larger issue of misuse and fraud.

914
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:55.000
When we look at our policies and procedures regarding the global issue of potential fraud and misuse, we actually have to look at three different documents.

915
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.500
We have to look at the law.

916
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:02.500
We have to look at the administrative rules.

917
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:07.500
And we have to actually look at the state-approved contract.

918
02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:27.500
So some of the issues that you're dealing with, particularly in this bill, have already been addressed within the state-approved contract, CSF must notify the department within five days if we make the determination of suspected intentional misuse or fraud.

919
02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:39.000
So whether you decide that you want to change the law in ad shall, you know, we don't have a position on that.

920
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I mean, personally, it seems reasonable to be.

921
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Our contract would require us to notify the AG's office regardless, so that's what we would do if we made the determination of fraud or misuse.

922
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Intentional misuse is actually defined within the administrative rules that the Department of Ed has issued.

923
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:15.500
It means, well, they define it for the purpose of this program as, it means knowingly and willfully for any amount of funds.

924
02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:27.000
But then we have to look at the law, and it creates a threshold of $500 or more or a Class B felony.

925
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
So that's one consideration.

926
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:39.500
If we step back for a moment and we look at the program, we have a layered process to prevent fraud.

927
02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:58.000
And this might be an occasion where we should actually come in and address the committee at a later time and discuss how the program works and the different layers of security that we have in place.

928
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I think it would be important for the committee to understand that every single transaction that goes through the EFA is seen by human eyes, right?

929
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So families don't receive this money.

930
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.500
It's not like they're given a check.

931
02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:19.500
They're not given cash.

932
02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:23.000
They can't make purchases on their own.

933
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:35.000
So every single expenditure is viewed by a trained staff person, program person at CSF to determine whether or not that expense is allowable.

934
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.500
And then routinely those orders are audited.

935
02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:43.000
So that's another control that we have in place.

936
02:08:43.000 --> 02:09:08.500
Regarding this bill specifically, I think that you might want to be careful because if you were to remove this language, if evidence of fraudulent use of EFA funds is obtained and the intentional and substantial, I just worry that you could open up families to potential abuse by bad actors.

937
02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:21.000
I envision perhaps, you know, an ex-husband or an abusive spouse that has – they want to make some sort of accusation against the party.

938
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:42.500
And if we don't have the ability to do some sort of preliminary investigation to see if those charges have any sort of merit before we escalate that to the AG's office, I think that that could put those people in harm's way.

939
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:46.500
Thank you, and thank you for the information.

940
02:09:46.500 --> 02:10:04.500
When you just said initial determination, I can't remember the exact words you used, but would that entail looking at the transactions for that account to try and match the transactions with the reported suspected fraud?

941
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:06.500
Exactly.

942
02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:10.000
So every incident would be different, right?

943
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:22.500
So we already have the process in place where a parent can't even spend money without a human eyes on it to okay the transaction.

944
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:39.500
So our decision-making requires if we receive a complaint, the complaint is received, an incident report is taken, we collect as much information as possible, and then we would attempt to corroborate that information.

945
02:10:39.500 --> 02:11:06.500
Now, if we're able to corroborate any of the information, we would then launch an official investigation where we would begin interviewing and we would do a deep dive into that person's account and we would freeze the account until we made a determination whether there – if there was suspected misuse or not.

946
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:19.000
And if we did, then we would escalate that to the AG's office and we would write a report and give them all the evidence.

947
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Further questions?

948
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.500
Not seeing any further questions.

949
02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.500
Thank you very much.

950
02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.500
Thank you very much.

951
02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:29.500
Oh, pardon me.

952
02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:34.500
Can I mention one other thing in relation to this?

953
02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:38.000
If it's a question of the department.

954
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Okay, thank you.

955
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.000
So with that, we're going to close this hearing down.

956
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
And where are we?

957
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
We're at lunch.

958
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:54.500
Could I mention one thing in relation to the last discussion?

959
02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:56.500
Well, you could, sure.

960
02:11:56.500 --> 02:12:00.000
Because this is for the committee, yes.

961
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Right, yes.

962
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:10.500
As you know, we have an EFA legislative oversight committee that Chairman Ladder and I are on.

963
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:14.500
And the next meeting will be in March.

964
02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:25.500
And I believe it is planned that there will be a demonstration of the electronic system called Class Wallet at that meeting.

965
02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:36.000
So, you know, we can confirm that with you and let you know the date and time for anyone who's interested.

966
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Good information.

967
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.500
Okay, not seeing anything else.

968
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.500
So it's one o'clock, we start back up.

969
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:48.000
Go out and find some good food.

970
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.500
At this time, 47 support, one opposed, zero neutral.

971
02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:54.500
Thank you.

972
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:59.000
At this time, 47 support, one opposed, zero neutral.

973
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
47 support, one opposed, zero neutral.

974
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Thank you.

975
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Matt, we don't have your pink card up here, Matt.

976
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.500
Oh, you left it on the counter.

977
02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:14.500
Okay.

1027
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:54.500
Thank you.

1028
02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:56.500
Thank you.

1029
02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:58.500
Thank you.

1030
02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.500
Thank you.

1031
02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:02.500
Thank you.

1032
02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:04.500
Thank you.

1033
02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:06.500
Thank you.

1034
02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:08.500
Thank you.

1035
02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.500
Thank you.

1036
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.500
Thank you.

1037
02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:14.500
Thank you.

1038
02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:16.500
Thank you.

1039
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:18.500
Thank you.

1040
02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.500
Thank you.

1041
02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:22.500
Thank you.

1042
02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.500
Thank you.

1043
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.500
Thank you.

1044
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:28.500
Thank you.

1045
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.500
Thank you.

1046
02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:32.500
Thank you.

1047
02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.500
Thank you.

1048
02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:36.500
Thank you.

1049
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.500
Thank you.

1050
02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:40.500
Thank you.

1051
02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.500
Thank you.

1052
02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.500
Thank you.

1053
02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.500
Thank you.

1054
02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.500
Thank you.

1055
02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.500
Thank you.

1056
02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.500
Thank you.

1057
02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.500
Thank you.

1058
02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:56.500
Thank you.

1059
02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:58.500
Thank you.

1060
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:03.500
I think we're ready to start our afternoon fun-filled session.

1061
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:16.000
And to begin the fun will be House Bill 1661, relative to regional career technical education agreements, and I'll recognize the prime sponsor, Representative Ladd.

1062
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Thank you very much, Representative Cordelli and members of the Education Committee.

1063
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:41.000
I may be the prime sponsor, but there are many people that have been involved in putting this effort together, including the senators sitting behind me, and many of those folks which are working in the CareerTech centers.

1064
02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:48.000
I appreciate all the support that they've offered us over the last years, plural.

1065
02:16:48.000 --> 02:17:04.000
So what I'd like to do is try to take about two minutes here to just talk about the CTE program we have in the state and the importance of this program.

1066
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:11.500
You all have a little copy of some materials which I left on everybody's desk.

1067
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:44.000
It shows the CTE centers, regional CTE centers that we have in our state, which I think the number approximates, and I can be around 28, not in our state, but we have five that run down the Connecticut River on the Vermont side where our children go to, and then we have the remainder, the other 23 sprinkled throughout the state of New Hampshire.

1068
02:17:44.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I think it's important if you go to page two of the handout that I've given you, it lists all the career tech centers, but it's interesting to note if you look at it that we have career tech centers that just don't receive from one school district.

1069
02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Obviously that's so, but you can see that some districts have as many as nine or so centers, regional centers have at least nine different school districts coming to them.

1070
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:33.000
And if you look down through that list, it's about, what, three pages in length or two pages or so.

1071
02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.500
It really identifies all that.

1072
02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:40.500
And it's kind of interesting to see where students go.

1073
02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:50.500
You might even see that there are some school districts that are sending districts that send to several different centers.

1074
02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:59.000
Now, if you go to the third page, I'd like to just address what these centers do.

1075
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.500
We used to call it vocational education.

1076
02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:04.500
It's no longer that.

1077
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.500
It's no longer you make the bookends or the birdhouses.

1078
02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:13.000
You learn how to pound a nail.

1079
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
We're way beyond that.

1080
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:31.500
In fact, there's a lot of data out there showing that the students who come out of the CTE program come out with a very high level of achievement on our statewide assessments.

1081
02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:42.000
They also come out with skills that qualify them for our workforce, and that's what this state of New Hampshire needs.

1082
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Look at all the different clusters, the career clusters that are now offered at CTE centers.

1083
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I just put this together rapidly last night.

1084
02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Agriculture and food and natural resources, architecture and construction, arts, AV, technology, communications, business management, administration, education and training, finance, government and public administration, health sciences, hospitality, human services, informational technology, law, public safety, corrections and security, manufacturing, marketing, science technology, engineering and mathematics, transportation, distribution, and logistics.

1085
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.500
These are all elements that our society needs skilled people within.

1086
02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:40.000
But you go beyond the cluster, and if you look at one of those specific clusters, and see what is being taught, for example, where science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is a cluster.

1087
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:49.500
Biotechnology, computer engineering technology, electrical, electronic, and communications technology, engineering design, engineering technology, and general engineering technology, and engineering.

1088
02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:52.000
Look at those in AV.

1089
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Theater.

1090
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Those are things that never occurred within our vocational program.

1091
02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:08.500
You get into some of the medical areas where you have pre-med being taught at the CTE centers now.

1092
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:11.500
So the whole dynamic has changed.

1093
02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:21.000
It's changed to keep in line with what our workforce demands are and where we're going as a society.

1094
02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:30.500
And it also just points to the importance of what these CTE centers are doing for us right now.

1095
02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:47.000
The next several pages where you see a 17 of 104 and 18 of 104, I that on and I'm not going to go through it but we talked about education rule yesterday.

1096
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.500
Education rule does speak to career technical education centers.

1097
02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:56.500
I won't go into that because you can read it.

1098
02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:10.000
Jumping and within the last year or two years we know we passed legislation where we put a committee together to look into tuition and transportation issues.

1099
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.500
We accomplished some of that, but have a long road still to hoe.

1100
02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:30.500
We looked at transportation, and we know that the cost of transportation for all our students in the state to go to a CTE center approximates $2.7 million.

1101
02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:34.500
In reality, though, we reimburse them around $680,000.

1102
02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:36.500
dollars.

1103
02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:52.000
And so here we start, we're coming into some of the restrictions or roadblocks are there that are hindering these centers to really go farther with what they need to do.

1104
02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
One, transportation costs.

1105
02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:06.000
We recognize that some students are not going to a CTE simply because the descending district doesn't have that transportation money to do so.

1106
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.500
We also know that the tuition costs are high.

1107
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:30.000
And the tuition costs, but you get a good bang for your buck, but the tuition is also a restrictive, seeing that we know that what we're funding totally of $9 million a year isn't really slicing or dicing.

1108
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
It's not cutting it.

1109
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
So we've learned that.

1110
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
But there's other things.

1111
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000
And this is what this bill now, where we are.

1112
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:51.000
On the back side, I've shown this sheet here where we compare our students with Delaware students in high school.

1113
02:23:51.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And we know that Delaware has a high percentage of kids participating with the same basic number of kids and our is much much lower so this bill does some very important things and I'd like to go walk right through that bill now fairly quickly.

1114
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:38.000
It creates what we call regional career and technical education agreements, where all the sending districts to a CTE center that receives sit down together, and they have this articulation agreement, which they're looking at, which governs how they're going to be working for the next four years.

1115
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:44.500
And they have to send this to the commissioner for review and approval.

1116
02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:47.500
It addresses these issues like calendar.

1117
02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:55.500
Calendar and scheduling of days which we function in the regular school district are hard enough.

1118
02:24:55.500 --> 02:25:04.500
But just imagine if you're in a center and receiving from nine different districts with nine different calendars.

1119
02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:11.000
Everybody wanting to have a teacher in service day on a different day.

1120
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:22.000
School days that are closed due to COVID or closed to snow, different snow days, and on and on the list goes.

1121
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:35.000
So one of the issues within our RCTEA agreement that we had, if you look at the first page on line 14, we want calendar conformity.

1122
02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:54.500
We want an agreement on how close can we get these calendars aligned so that we don't have any more than X number of days, which are diverging from the days which we have to be at the center.

1123
02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:03.000
In the past, we've had school districts which have had days which might be a vacation day.

1124
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:12.000
The kid in the receiving and the sending school district has vacation day, but the center is open.

1125
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000
So now that student's having to figure out how to get there.

1126
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Fortunately, many of the districts are providing that transportation to the center.

1127
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Now, that's a good working relationship.

1128
02:26:27.000 --> 02:27:27.500
Agreements shall minimize schedule conflicts to better support cte students with as many hours as possible to fulfill their program requirements we're looking at disruptions to get start and stop times we're looking at unscheduled school closures or events we're looking at daily class start and stop times there's issues with that we look at the kids which are going to the five centers across the river in Vermont and their CTE course program extends a half hour longer than it does in New Hampshire and so the kids go over there and you have to cut bait a little early to get back for the classes which are starting the other side other side of the river, or vice versa.

1129
02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:35.000
And it's very difficult for that student to be a part of that whole program.

1130
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:44.000
That exists, too, when you have block scheduling here that's different than the scheduling at the receiving school.

1131
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:54.500
What we're trying to do is look at all those days between Labor Day and the end of the school year.

1132
02:27:54.500 --> 02:28:04.500
How many days within that calendar from Labor Day to the end of the school year can be dissimilar days?

1133
02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:08.000
We know there's going to be some.

1134
02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
This bill says five.

1135
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:18.500
We got that language from the state of Maine, which has been successful in moving that direction.

1136
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.000
But that took them years.

1137
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:25.000
They started on this process back in 2013.

1138
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Now what we want to do is have a similar process here in the state, but we recognize that five days after working with folks in Salem and Concord, up in the Lakes region, up in Conway, at the centers, we're hearing that's going to be a real steep road to climb.

1139
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.000
So we have an amendment that we will be foot and forth.

1140
02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:20.000
It's coming from a unanimous agreement of the people on the tuition and transportation committee, because they were tasked with looking at tuition and transportation or anything other affecting CTE programs, at a wide open avenue to work on and the recommendation came out 10 days.

1141
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Okay so we put 10 days in that.

1142
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:36.000
When CTE regions overlap or students attend programs in more than one CTE the provisions of this section shall apply to both regional centers.

1143
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.500
So that's the alignment we're looking at.

1144
02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:53.500
Going further with this, some of the issues we have with tuition and transportation, this is on the bottom of page 1, on lines 29, 30, and 31.

1145
02:29:53.500 --> 02:30:19.000
The sending schools who wish to attend a CTE subject to attainment of prerequisites space availability within the program and appropriate qualifications under rsa 180 a 1e that colon 2 roman 8b that has to do with charter schools who's responsible responsible for providing the transportation for a charter school kid?

1146
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:28.500
It is the district in which that charter school student is living, not where the charter school is located.

1147
02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:39.000
So the responsibility for tuition costs come from the sending district in which that student for the charter school is living.

1148
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.500
Transportation, I addressed that there just at that point in time.

1149
02:30:44.500 --> 02:31:03.000
Now we're also looking at the issue of there are schools which are saying you will take this basic course that's necessary for graduation as spelt out in ed 306 you will take that at our school.

1150
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:13.500
We have since allowed a child to a student to attend a CTE if they're in grades 10, 11, or 12.

1151
02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:20.500
Many of those basic courses offered in 9 and 10 are required for graduation.

1152
02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:25.500
You haven't gotten into a lot of the electives yet.

1153
02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:35.000
There are schools that are just firm in saying those basic courses will be taught in the sending school.

1154
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:56.500
Even though, we had this conversation just the other day, even though the competencies may be embedded in a course either in culinary arts or in some other aspect of what you're doing in one of those other clusters at the CTE center.

1155
02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:33.500
How do we ensure that a child's not going to be held back in ascending school because they're having to make this decision that I have to be here for my one o'clock class in this basic English course or communications course or whatever the required course is, and I can't get involved in the programs that people in the back of me are providing with the directors and the staff at the CTE.

1156
02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:46.000
It puts them out of alignment with that program at the CTE center, and really it's making them make a choice as a young student.

1157
02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Here's the avenue I'm going to drive in, even though I want to be over there learning biomedical issues, which are taught.

1158
02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:03.000
I saw that taught in one of the schools, too, down there.

1159
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I'm just flabbergasted by what's going on in our centers right now.

1160
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:20.000
This opportunity can't be denied to a student because they have to get tied up in the school that they're coming from.

1161
02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:38.500
So what we're looking at in the basic part, the last page of this, is how can we avoid this occurrence from taking place so the student can get those competencies while they're at the CTE center.

1162
02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:41.000
This bill provides for that.

1163
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:49.000
It may be provided either by approval of the local district and the sending district agreeing.

1164
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Some may be doing that now.

1165
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:58.500
I'm not denying that, but we know that there's others that are not.

1166
02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:12.500
So the other approach is that the embedded competencies may be approved by the Department of Education or the State Board, and they would get credit for graduation.

1167
02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:21.500
However, that will be done in conjunction with what they are requiring for competencies at the local district.

1168
02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:35.000
If, in fact, the course at the CTE center is only offering three of the five competencies, the student will get partial credit for that graduation credit.

1169
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:42.000
That doesn't mean they get the credit but they're three-fifths of the way there.

1170
02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.500
And so that has been built into this law as well.

1171
02:34:47.500 --> 02:35:53.500
On the last couple lines in this bill it reads the requirements for this regional technical education center agreements rcteas under statute this and statute that as inserted by this act shall not be implemented until rules of the department of education pursuant to rsa 188 e colon 1a roman 2 are adopted and effective that means that even though this bill might be signed at the date which we have there at july 1 2022 it means that the rules have to be in place before anything can go forward and we know the length that it takes for rules to be made at the department the state board and approved by jalkar so there is time for transition in this process so So with that, I won't go any farther.

1172
02:35:53.500 --> 02:36:03.000
I will open it up for questions, and I will try to answer them the best way I can.

1173
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:13.000
If I can't, then I hope that we can have directors or Senator behind me just able to answer those.

1174
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:19.000
I know Senator Waters has always been very capable in this area.

1175
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.500
He's been very involved with CTE way before I got involved with it.

1176
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:51.500
But right now, I absorb this as my aspiration is that I think this is probably one of our most important things we can do in education today, is get more kids into our CTE centers, into those skill programs, and try to facilitate their being ready for our careers and pathways.

1177
02:36:51.500 --> 02:37:03.000
The indicators in RSA 193E that we measure the delivery of an adequate education contain a number of indicators that are CTE oriented.

1178
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Thank you very much.

1179
02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Thank you, Representative.

1180
02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Are there questions from the committee?

1181
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Representative Luno.

1182
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1183
02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:23.500
Chair, and thank you very much, Representative Ladd and Senator Waters for working together to bring this forward.

1184
02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:25.500
Let's see.

1185
02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:41.000
Representative Vlad, you had mentioned that an amendment, I guess, is going to be forthcoming and that one of the areas that would be addressing is the calendar alignment instructional days?

1186
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
That is correct.

1187
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:53.500
And I'd like to add, too, that there are two sponsors on this amendment, and we're not talking about that now.

1188
02:37:53.500 --> 02:38:00.000
I'm just advising the committee that this has been developed, Ladd and Waters.

1189
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
When we have it as a committee, we will have only representatives on that.

1190
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:38.500
we can't have a senator's name on it but at this point in time Senators Waters is gladly asked that his name can be put on this simply because this has been a total bipartisan effort and it's coming out of the committees which for example represent Cornell is on the advisory counts is an effort that we'd like to see go forward.

1191
02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:53.500
What I would be asking is that we can get support from our committee and do an amendment that addresses what's here but show a lot of good, strong support.

1192
02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:55.500
So, Mike, thanks.

1193
02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:58.500
I'm glad to hear that, Rick.

1194
02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:02.500
I think that's an excellent way to proceed.

1195
02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:09.000
My question surrounds the amendment, particularly as it's focused on the instructional days.

1196
02:39:09.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And as you know from your work in public schools, and as many of us know from our work on school boards, calendar is like one of the most difficult things um and actually it was it was probably my least favorite thing to uh to uh work on uh when i served on a school board um so i was just wondering and going from initially landing at five and going to ten um what sort of considerations were done particularly as as the region going from initially landing at 5 and going to 10, what sort of considerations were done, particularly as the regional agreements become more complicated if more than one CTE center is involved?

1197
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.500
I'd like to respond to that, if I may.

1198
02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.500
Yeah, thanks.

1199
02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:27.500
When we put this together, we had several directors went through and did this with all the schools which were within that regional CTEA, our CTEA.

1200
02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:38.500
And we'd see things like Pelham and Wyndham and what their schedules look like in terms of the center they go to.

1201
02:40:38.500 --> 02:41:24.000
And spreadsheets were made we saw all the non-conforming dates and it's it there's a there's a number of them and for example in the state of Maine they don't allow a teacher professional day or in-service day to be allowed as a non-conforming day what they advise is that you try and get all these in that area on the same day so that you can have teachers from one district to another crossing the lines so you can actually save some money and people receive that type of training.

1202
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:31.000
But we have exceptions to this as well, which we wrote into the bill.

1203
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Initially, it was for extenuating and emergency purposes.

1204
02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000
A waiver can be granted by the commissioner.

1205
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Then recognizing, and after discussion with the folks that are directing and understanding and managing these CTE centers, it came, and the bottom line is kind of important here in the amendment.

1206
02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:20.500
It says, if the commissioner determines that all schools within the RCTEA have plans and are reasonably working towards the implementation of an aligned calendar to ensure compliance with this paragraph, an annual waiver may be approved, but a waiver for this purpose shall not be extended beyond July 1, 2026.

1207
02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:29.000
There's four years here in which a waiver can be provided for this type of reasonable effort.

1208
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
You're working together.

1209
02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:35.500
And we've heard they're already starting to do this.

1210
02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:43.500
But with four years, that's getting in line with the Carl Perkins money, which comes down.

1211
02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:47.500
And we talked about the Carl Perkins money.

1212
02:42:47.500 --> 02:43:05.000
There's $6 million that comes from the federal government, and that's how some of the grants have been just recently doled out to these centers, and roughly around $4 million goes to the individual centers.

1213
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000
That Carl Perkins has to be renewed every four years.

1214
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:24.000
We're getting the schedules here within the RCTEA agreements aligned with the Carl Perkins sequence of grants, and that's why we're taking the four years down below too.

1215
02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:39.500
But an extenuating or an emergency waiver can be provided any time in the future due to the fact that, well, look at what we're in right now, COVID, the pandemic.

1216
02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:49.000
Look what's happening on horrible winters when we get awful weather and you have to take these days off.

1217
02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:54.000
So waivers can be provided for all kinds of issues.

1218
02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:01.000
And hopefully, and I believe we're granting those waivers right now for various things.

1219
02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
The commissioner does that.

1220
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.500
And it's usually a healthy working relationship that that is accomplished.

1221
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:12.500
So the last sentence there gives the flexibility.

1222
02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:37.500
if you're reasonably working towards this end and they are believe me they all want to get to this end I think we can do this and we can get there Maine had a similar issue and there were some waivers given but there's their their transition was hars ours.

1223
02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:43.000
They went right to the five days, and that wasn't easy.

1224
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:50.500
But their instructional organization with their SADs versus our SAUs are a little bit different.

1225
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.500
Thank you very much.

1226
02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:54.500
Thank you.

1227
02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.500
Any further questions?

1228
02:44:56.500 --> 02:44:58.500
Representative Boehm.

1229
02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:00.500
Thank you, Mr.

1230
02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:02.500
Chairman.

1231
02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:05.500
Thank you for taking the question.

1232
02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:20.500
In start, one of the problems with the days we learned wasn't it that the CTE may start before Labor Day and one of the sending schools after Labor Day.

1233
02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:35.500
So that was one of the issues, but wasn't it, though, that one of the schools that was starting after Labor Day still provided transportation to CTE before Labor Day?

1234
02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:39.000
We're aware, Representative Boehm, of that situation.

1235
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:52.000
We're also aware that the governor had a task force looking at that and looking at the possibility of starting all our schools after Labor Day.

1236
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:58.000
That did not fly well with local control, and I understand why.

1237
02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:14.500
But this is why you also see in this legislation where all those days prior to Labor Day, we're not starting this alignment until after Labor Day to the last day of school.

1238
02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:17.500
So we're avoiding that mess up.

1239
02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:25.500
And I will never get everybody on the same page as far as when school starts.

1240
02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:33.500
You know, athletic programs and relationships with abutting districts, it all comes into focus and play.

1241
02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:42.500
And I think it's wise to do as this bill is doing Labor Day through the last day.

1242
02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:49.000
We will align all but 10 days to make sure this thing works.

1243
02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:55.000
It's the first time we've ever had the opportunity to move forward.

1244
02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:02.500
We have had this issue hammering on us ever since I've been here on education.

1245
02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:04.500
That's 14 years.

1246
02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:07.500
It's time to make it happen.

1247
02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:09.500
Thank you.

1248
02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.500
Any further questions from the committee?

1249
02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:14.500
Representative Lakers.

1250
02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:39.500
This was something that just popped into my head, was to wonder, if a school isn't running buses because they're doing in-service days or whatever, the parents of the kids can still drive the – I mean, the kids can still go to the CTE if they have other transportation.

1251
02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:42.000
Is that true or not?

1252
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
That is true.

1253
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:52.500
And I will also say that most of the districts are making that effort to get them.

1254
02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:56.000
That part they're starting to work on.

1255
02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:33.000
There is reimbursement if you're traveling in your own personal vehicle, which can be approved by that district, and you get reimbursed at 25 cents a mile the tuition reimbursement for a school bus per child is 10 cents per mile that's kind of weak but that's what we reverse them at thank you very much see no further questions thank you representative lad And next I'll call on the other architect, Senator Waters.

1256
02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.500
Thank you, Representative Cordelli and members of the committee.

1257
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:40.000
Awfully good to see you.

1258
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.500
I'm Senator David Waters from District 4.

1259
02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:47.000
And I was trying to think, Mr.

1260
02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Chairman, whether you and I are now, are we the mutton Jeff of career and technical education, maybe?

1261
02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.500
But we haven't worked at this a long time.

1262
02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:08.000
And I think the chairman gave a great presentation on CTEs and on the bill.

1263
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.500
But I just want to make a few extra points here as well.

1264
02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:18.000
So there is quite a history here.

1265
02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:32.000
It's been about 10 years that I've been working on the CTE issues in the Senate, and we did set up an advisory council under Senate Bill 190.

1266
02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:56.000
And part of the reason for setting that up was identifying many of the issues here as well as getting more of a legislative focus on the development of the CTE program, which we all recognize is so important for workforce development and the aspirations of our students.

1267
02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:02.000
And, you know, even 10 years ago we identified some key issues.

1268
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:21.500
We needed to work on the tuition and transportation funding, and I will say as an aside that Representative Umberger has had some really good ideas about this on the committee of the Representative Ladd set up last year.

1269
02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:27.500
Also, kind of key points on transportation and the alignment of calendars.

1270
02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:50.000
And then thirdly, another area is to make sure that students can get the credits that they need, both as embedded credits, a lot of work from the chairman on math credits in CTE classes being counted, and now trying to take that step forward.

1271
02:50:50.000 --> 02:51:05.000
And I think that the kind of principle here is that we really do believe that New Hampshire students have a right to the opportunity to career and technical education.

1272
02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
It's their aspiration.

1273
02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
It's their family's aspirations.

1274
02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:15.000
It's good for the workforce and the economic development of New Hampshire.

1275
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:21.000
And I think we're making a lot of progress to do that.

1276
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:33.500
I know there's been a lot of discussion about the calendar alignment, and the approach that we took was to look at these regional agreements.

1277
02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:48.500
They had existed previously just primarily for the issue of the renovation and construction of centers, and up until this point, they had just been used mostly for that purpose.

1278
02:51:48.500 --> 02:52:18.500
And we said, why not use that as a way of having agreements through that kind of regional organization so that we're not trying to do a top-heavy micromanagement of CTEs from the legislature or from the department, but to say, you know best, use these agreements to work out the things that are in these bills, in this bill.

1279
02:52:18.500 --> 02:52:25.000
And that's why the flexibility is so important, as Chairman Ladd has outlined.

1280
02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:28.000
We have an aspiration 10 days.

1281
02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:38.500
In the agreement, you can build in some flexibility, and that becomes part of the agreement, and that will be okay.

1282
02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:47.500
If even after that, there are some issues, then the commissioner can help you out with a waiver.

1283
02:52:47.500 --> 02:53:02.000
To me, in some ways, I think the most important parts of these bills have to do with the opportunity for enrolling in the programs and completing the programs.

1284
02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:22.000
And really starting at the bottom of the first page here, how it is that they can attain their prerequisites, how it is they can attain their credits, and how it is that they can get space in the program.

1285
02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:35.000
And then on the next page, page 2, line 6, shall be given access to career and technical education programs for instructional time for those programs.

1286
02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:54.500
If the instructional time is supposed to be a couple of hours and you can't get there a half an hour after or have to leave in a half an hour before it's done, you're going to fall behind.

1287
02:53:54.500 --> 02:54:01.500
Now, we're even looking into what if maybe Jeff Beer can talk about this.

1288
02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:23.000
I said, well, why don't we see if we can't get the buses to have Wi-Fi so that a student might be able to tune into the classroom and get some of the instruction that they might be missing while they're in transit.

1289
02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:32.000
However we do it, that's what students need because they have to get their certificate or their credentials.

1290
02:54:32.000 --> 02:55:05.000
If they're going to go into the automotive, they they've got to get they have to fulfill certain number of credits a certain number of hours there and then the heart of it of course is is in section 4 CTE credits and here the proficiencies competencies this principle if we put it in statute before and now we're saying we really mean it, you know.

1291
02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.000
You ought to recognize these competencies.

1292
02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:15.500
That's where the answer's on the lead on competency education and that kinds of flexibility.

1293
02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:31.000
And then also it says, look, you really do need to find a way for the sending school to give approval to what the education they're getting in the receiving school.

1294
02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:36.500
Because we've had some examples where there's a little possessiveness there.

1295
02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:46.500
Certain departments in the sending schools say, no, we want to make sure we keep our enrollments here on that.

1296
02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:51.500
And this says, no, no, let's be student-centered here, right?

1297
02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:57.500
Let's be student-centered and make sure it can work for the student.

1298
02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:09.000
So I just wanted to mention those things, but just to conclude by saying that this is just so important for workforce development.

1299
02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:14.500
I think that we all have seen what's been going on.

1300
02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:27.000
Our employers are just crying out, particularly in a lot of these technical fields, and we have done a lot on dual and concurrent enrollments.

1301
02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:48.000
You're going to see Bill from me a little bit later on in the session that makes sure the sophomores can participate in that and non-STEN students can participate in the dual and concurrent enrollment program and get tuition reimbursements as well.

1302
02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:54.500
This is just key for us to build the workforce of the future.

1303
02:56:54.500 --> 02:57:02.000
As I said before, I think it really is also the philosophy of New Hampshire.

1304
02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
We're an opportunity society.

1305
02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
We're student-centered.

1306
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
We're family-centered.

1307
02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:17.500
We want these students to meet their aspirations and have their opportunities, and that's what CTEs can give them.

1308
02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:19.500
Thank you, Mr.

1309
02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:21.500
Chairman.

1310
02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.500
Thank you, Senator.

1311
02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:27.500
Any questions for the Senator from the committee?

1312
02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:29.500
Representative Luno.

1313
02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.500
Great.

1314
02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:34.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

1315
02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Chair.

1316
02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Thank you very much, Senator, for joining us this afternoon.

1317
02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:48.500
Just a couple of questions, particularly along the page 2, section 4 of the bill.

1318
02:57:48.500 --> 02:58:11.000
First question really goes to the embedded core competencies as approved, and I certainly understand it was approved by the sending district under the terms of the agreement, but what are you getting at here as approved by or by the State Board of Education?

1319
02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:20.000
well I think that there is a there is a by or by the State Board of Education?

1320
02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Well, I think that there is a mechanism here whereby, through the review of these reasonable agreements, it may be that the State Board of Education has a role for approving these.

1321
02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
And so that's all.

1322
02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:50.000
I think Jeff Beard can speak a little bit more to that as to which programs and which courses that might kick in for.

1323
02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Okay, that's right.

1324
02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:57.500
But the ideal here is for the RCTEA to cover that.

1325
02:58:57.500 --> 02:58:59.500
Right, right.

1326
02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:05.000
No, I'll save that question for a little bit later then.

1327
02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.500
And just a follow-up, Mr.

1328
02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:09.500
Chair.

1329
02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:20.000
The final sentence, I think, in Section 4 sort of relates to, I'd call it, unbundled competencies and getting partial credit.

1330
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:33.500
And one of your comments, Senator, was that New Hampshire is in the lead, and I would assume in the lead nationally in terms of competency-based education.

1331
02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:44.000
And I'm just wondering how these unbundled competencies fit into, I guess, that sort of solid, rigorous commitment to competency-based ed.

1332
02:59:44.000 --> 03:00:19.500
Well, I would think here, and again, I think the chairman has some particular thoughts about this in terms of math and some other things, that certainly in some of the CTE courses that you would have a competency in a certain area of, say, math or the sciences, but certainly that CTE course as a whole would not provide all the credit for the required course from the sending school.

1333
03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:23.000
So it's a way of recognizing that.

1334
03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:28.500
And there are some partial credit courses at CTEs as well.

1335
03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:30.500
Okay, great.

1336
03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:32.500
Thanks.

1337
03:00:32.500 --> 03:00:49.500
So the way I'm understanding that is that they're not unbundled from the package of competency designed in the CTE course or program, but they just might not align 100% to a graduation requirement.

1338
03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:51.500
Right, you've got it.

1339
03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:56.000
You said it better than I was trying to.

1340
03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
Thank you very much.

1341
03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Any further questions?

1342
03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Representative Bohm.

1343
03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Thank you, Mr.

1344
03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Chairman.

1345
03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Thank you for taking the question.

1346
03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:28.500
On the competencies, if the receiving school, the CTE center, which is in a school, for example, Salem, for example, they have a biomed course, which that school gives all the competencies needed for one of the science class.

1347
03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:36.500
If the CTE center has all those competencies, shouldn't the sending school also allow those competencies?

1348
03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:42.500
Well, I personally would think that makes a whole lot of sense.

1349
03:01:42.500 --> 03:02:22.000
What we thought was best is to let that be part of the RCTEA agreement so that there could be an acknowledgment from the sending school yeah we feel good about that and for this student's schedule there's no way they can do the CTE without having that happen and so I hope that that's what we will see that kind of cooperation thank you thank you seeing no further questions thank you very much senator for being here.

1350
03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
Thank you all.

1351
03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:27.500
Have a good afternoon, a good weekend.

1352
03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:30.000
Next we have Jen Haskins.

1353
03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Good afternoon.

1354
03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:49.000
My name is Jennifer Haskins, and I am the president of NICTA, which is the New Hampshire Career and Technical Education Association, the statewide organization that supports career and technical education in New Hampshire.

1355
03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:54.500
Career and technical education serves about 9,000 students by their choice.

1356
03:02:54.500 --> 03:03:03.000
I'm offering oral testimony, but I've also passed around written testimony that I ask you to review.

1357
03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:18.500
I want to start by saying how much I appreciate the bipartisan support that this bill has given to CTE and for all the students in the state of New Hampshire.

1358
03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:29.000
We want to acknowledge and extend the gratitude of the lawmakers bringing the challenges faced by our CTE students Thank you.

1359
03:03:29.000 --> 03:04:03.500
students in the state of new hampshire we want to acknowledge and extend the gratitude of the lawmakers bringing the challenges faced by our cte students the nicta organization is offering this oral testimony in support of this bill the bill as a whole has an impact to impact cte in so many positive ways calendar alignment many students and centers have faced this as an obstacle for years.

1360
03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:15.000
And the intent of calendar alignment is what is best for New Hampshire CTE students to complete these courses and access their programs.

1361
03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:27.000
Based on the testimony that we've heard prior, I understand that an amendment is coming forth to increase the days from 5 to 10.

1362
03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.000
We strongly support that as well.

1363
03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:43.500
But one of the most impactful parts of this bill that I think we need to speak about is the embedded graduation credits within the CTE classes.

1364
03:04:43.500 --> 03:05:23.500
By stripping away this barrier that many students face when choosing a course for graduation in order to graduate and the ability to further their career path by attending a CTE program CTE centers for years have invested incredible time in curriculum design at the state and center level that we we try to remove these barriers, address the subject matters of both the CTE course competencies as well as core academics, while advancing these students in their career path.

1365
03:05:23.500 --> 03:06:22.500
Some of these examples can be found here in Concord at the Concord CTE Center and in Laconia at the Hewitt cte center where students that attend specific example the video programming program they have one of their sending schools gives the student the graduation requirement of half a credit of art and half a credit of digital literacy embedding those two into their program so that they are not asked to add those to their schedule each year the bill also evaluates the importance of cte and the role we play as a choice for students to have meaningful career opportunities within new hampshire and public education while ensuring that they also meet these core graduation requirements.

1366
03:06:22.500 --> 03:06:34.500
This bill has the potential to change the landscape and serve students and families in a far more progressive manner than we presently are.

1367
03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:54.000
As our full association reflected on House Bill 1661, we would like to have clarification by the legislative body in regards to the meaning and intent of parts of the bill that we specifically identified in our written testimony.

1368
03:06:54.000 --> 03:07:38.000
I'd like to close my testimony by highlighting for all of the committee members that though much of the focus and discussion has been on the alignment of calendars, It is necessary to keep in mind that the spirit of this bill is trying to remove the barriers for our students HV 1661 is about much more than calendar alignment it's about honoring New Hampshire students choices and removing as many barriers as possible for their success thank you thank you very you very much for your testimony.

1369
03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.500
Are there any questions from committee members?

1370
03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:44.500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

1371
03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:50.000
I believe there might be a couple of questions for Mr.

1372
03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Beard from the department.

1373
03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Is that correct?

1374
03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
If Mr.

1375
03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Beard, if you'd like to testify, if we could also ask you to fill out a pink card, just say it's technical support, you can do that afterwards.

1376
03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Thank you, Representative Cordelli.

1377
03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
Thank you, honorable members.

1378
03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Yes, Mr.

1379
03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Chair, thank you.

1380
03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Representative Luneau.

1381
03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Thank you.

1382
03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Thank you very much.

1383
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:28.000
And I'm sorry, I was just reading Ms.

1384
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:40.000
Haskins' points that she made with regards to clarity on some sections, so I may have a question to you on this as well.

1385
03:08:40.000 --> 03:09:02.000
But a question earlier to Senator Waters related to, let's see, no, it's actually line 22 on page 2, where a student completing an embedded career technical education course demonstrates proficiency in the embedded course competencies as approved by the State Board of Education.

1386
03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:13.500
I was wondering if you could sort of talk about what that means and maybe give us an example of what that is.

1387
03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:15.500
Absolutely, Representative.

1388
03:09:15.500 --> 03:09:17.500
I'm happy to.

1389
03:09:17.500 --> 03:09:29.500
So I just wanted to begin by making a distinction between CTE competencies and the competencies for embedded credit as listed in the bill.

1390
03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:31.500
Thank you.

1391
03:09:31.500 --> 03:09:43.500
So I just want to begin by making a distinction between CTE competencies and the competencies for embedded credit as listed in the bill.

1392
03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:57.500
When we talk about CTE competencies, there are a set of competencies that every CTE student must complete in order to show that they've completed the CTE program.

1393
03:09:57.500 --> 03:10:02.500
In the case here, we're talking about embedded course competencies.

1394
03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:12.000
So typically what we think of as academic course competencies, science, math, English language arts, things of that nature.

1395
03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:28.000
So an example could be a young person in a CT program who is taking a culinary arts course, they might have some course content that could demonstrate proficiency in math competencies.

1396
03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:40.000
They may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the competencies that would be needed to give them full credit for high school graduation.

1397
03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:51.500
but there could be an opportunity to identify the competencies that they're attaining that could give them partial credit towards high school graduation.

1398
03:10:51.500 --> 03:10:53.500
Okay, and a follow-up?

1399
03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:55.500
Yes.

1400
03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:12.500
So wouldn't those competencies already be identified in the CTE course that the student is taking as opposed to embedded course competencies that are, I guess, related to graduation requirements by the sending school?

1401
03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:15.500
That work would need to happen.

1402
03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:19.000
They would need to have that identification.

1403
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:24.000
So at the present time, that is not often happening.

1404
03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.500
It is in some cases.

1405
03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:32.000
An example would be in the Salem Career Technical Education Center.

1406
03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:38.000
There is a computer science course that's also an AP science course.

1407
03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:46.500
It counts towards credit, graduation credit for the CTE piece, but also for the computer science requirement.

1408
03:11:46.500 --> 03:11:48.500
It's a graduation requirement.

1409
03:11:48.500 --> 03:12:01.000
So in terms of having embedded course competencies, that would have to be identified by the CTE center working in conjunction with the setting school.

1410
03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
Thank you.

1411
03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:12.500
course competencies that would have to be identified by the CTE center working in conjunction with the sending school.

1412
03:12:12.500 --> 03:12:27.000
Really, the sending schools have to accept competencies or course credit for graduation, so there needs to have that collaborative piece, which is what's spelled out in the bill.

1413
03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
Okay.

1414
03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
Follow up, I assume?

1415
03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
No, no.

1416
03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:39.000
You know, I've got to think on this a little bit more.

1417
03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
Okay.

1418
03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:44.500
So it may come back to me.

1419
03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:46.500
Okay.

1420
03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:48.500
So thank you.

1421
03:12:48.500 --> 03:12:51.000
Further questions from the committee?

1422
03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
Representative Porter.

1423
03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
Thank you, Mr.

1424
03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.000
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

1425
03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:02.500
I didn't get your name, though, sir.

1426
03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:04.500
Dr.

1427
03:13:04.500 --> 03:13:06.500
Jeff Beard.

1428
03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:09.500
I'm with the Department of Education.

1429
03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:13.000
I'm the Deputy State Commissioner for CTE.

1430
03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
Thank you, Dr.

1431
03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
Beard.

1432
03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:23.500
So I'm really new at this, dealing with competencies and how they work.

1433
03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:31.000
So say I'm a college, I mean a high school sophomore in the culinary program.

1434
03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:44.000
And part of that program requires me to double the recipe for a cake without using, you know, be able to do it in my head.

1435
03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:55.000
Which would obviously show that I can know how to deal with fractions, know how to deal with that kind of stuff.

1436
03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:10.500
If dealing with fractions is a competency requirement for a high school math class, then I, in my culinary arts class, showing that I can do that, have met that competency.

1437
03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:14.000
Is that what we're talking about here?

1438
03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000
Yes.

1439
03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
Okay.

1440
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:29.500
So what we need to do then is have an alignment between the competencies for culinary arts and my high school math class.

1441
03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:45.500
That's a big task, I would assume, to be able to get all the high school math teachers, all the high school courses competencies, all the culinary arts, and put them together.

1442
03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:47.500
Who does that work?

1443
03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:50.500
I'm so glad you asked that.

1444
03:14:50.500 --> 03:15:22.500
In the fiscal note that the department submitted, along with this bill, we put in under the section around the methods and calculations and methodology, we determined that it would take about half of the time, 50% of the time, of a full-time education consultant working within the Bureau of Career Development, which is the bureau in the department that oversees career technical education.

1445
03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:33.500
Some of this work would be specifically around identifying those alignments to say, these are the math competencies for high school math.

1446
03:15:33.500 --> 03:15:56.500
These are the competencies found in each career and technical education program and developing some model crosswalks that would allow the schools to then just plug in rather than having them do that work locally, which we acknowledge is a significant amount of time and effort.

1447
03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:58.500
Follow-up, yes.

1448
03:15:58.500 --> 03:16:04.500
Another question that I have concerning courses taken in our community colleges.

1449
03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:10.500
Are those sometimes part of the credits, the CTE programs, as well?

1450
03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:12.500
Yes.

1451
03:16:12.500 --> 03:16:17.000
There's a Running Start program that offers dual enrollment.

1452
03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:30.000
And that is something that all of our career technical education centers offer, running start courses that are also count towards graduation credit in many cases.

1453
03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
Sometimes it's elective.

1454
03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:35.000
And that's an important distinction also.

1455
03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:48.500
But it is a requirement for Perkins funding, which is the federal CTU funding, to include an opportunity to earn college credit while still in high school.

1456
03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:55.000
So many, if not all, of our programs do take advantage of that.

1457
03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
Follow up?

1458
03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
One more?

1459
03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
One more.

1460
03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
Thank you.

1461
03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:17.000
So I know that we have Chairman Ladd gave us facts and figures comparing the state of Delaware to the state of New Hampshire in their CTE program.

1462
03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:30.000
And I know because I have family and several grandchildren in Delaware who have gone through the school system there, and my husband has taught there.

1463
03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:33.500
So I'm a little familiar with that.

1464
03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:43.500
And I know that in Delaware, if a student's high school graduation grades, cumulative grade is above 3.0 or 2.5.

1465
03:17:43.500 --> 03:17:49.000
They get free tuition at the community colleges in the state.

1466
03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.500
All expenses paid for them.

1467
03:17:51.500 --> 03:18:09.500
And I'm wondering, in these programs that we have here at the CTE, Is there a charge to the students for taking the community college courses that are part of the program, or are those free?

1468
03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:12.000
I'm glad you asked that.

1469
03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:17.000
There was no charge to the student or their families.

1470
03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:31.000
The governor generously created a STEM scholarship some years back that's still in effect that's now been expanded to include all of the courses covered by Running Start.

1471
03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.500
Thank you so much, sir.

1472
03:18:33.500 --> 03:18:35.500
You're welcome.

1473
03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:37.500
Thank you.

1474
03:18:37.500 --> 03:18:39.500
Yes, Representative Tanner.

1475
03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:41.500
Thank you, Mr.

1476
03:18:41.500 --> 03:18:45.500
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

1477
03:18:45.500 --> 03:18:50.500
I'm concerned about that area of embedded credits as well.

1478
03:18:50.500 --> 03:18:53.500
I'm a little confused by it.

1479
03:18:53.500 --> 03:19:10.500
And kind of going back to the contract that the sending school sets with the CTE, in that contract, is it kind of mediated out what embedded credits they will accept or not accept?

1480
03:19:10.500 --> 03:19:28.000
And also, I guess my second part of that is, if it can't be mediated out, is this statement or by the State Board of Education kind of the hammer that says you have to.

1481
03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:31.500
I'm glad you asked that, Representative Tanner.

1482
03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:35.500
So this is not yet something that happens.

1483
03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:40.500
So this would be new were this bill to pass.

1484
03:19:40.500 --> 03:19:56.500
But the idea would be that, yes, it would be mediated to be part of that regional agreement to have that statement of how embedded credits would be given for graduation credit.

1485
03:19:56.500 --> 03:20:01.000
And again, at this time, this is not happening.

1486
03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:09.000
But there could be an opportunity for the State Board of Education to make that determination.

1487
03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:12.500
May I have a follow-up on that?

1488
03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:14.500
Yes.

1489
03:20:14.500 --> 03:20:16.500
Thank you.

1490
03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:42.000
So let's say a young person wants to go into nursing, and they have the opportunity to go to a CTE and possibly get a LNA from that, but then they apply to college, and the colleges say, you know, you need to have a chemistry class, a lab chemistry class.

1491
03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:49.000
Can the CTE actually give a competency for chemistry that doesn't involve a lab?

1492
03:20:49.000 --> 03:21:00.000
Or how is that put on the transcript for me going from the sending school applying to UNH for nursing, for example?

1493
03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:05.500
To be honest, I'm not sure how that would work technically.

1494
03:21:05.500 --> 03:21:16.500
I would imagine that the way that they would handle that is, again, graduation credits determine if you have the content knowledge.

1495
03:21:16.500 --> 03:21:22.500
By earning those credits, that signals that you have that content knowledge.

1496
03:21:22.500 --> 03:21:40.000
So if UNH, say, requires a chemistry credit, then it would be the responsibility of the CTE center working with the sending school to determine how to ensure that young person has that chemistry credit.

1497
03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:45.500
And would the State Department of Education be involved in that?

1498
03:21:45.500 --> 03:21:52.000
The State Board of Education could be part of it, but not necessarily.

1499
03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000
Thank you.

1500
03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000
Any further questions?

1501
03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:59.000
Representative Luno got his question together.

1502
03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000
Not really entirely, Mr.

1503
03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000
Chair.

1504
03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:08.000
You know, there's a lot to like about this bill.

1505
03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.500
There's no question about that.

1506
03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:17.000
And Representative Ladd and I have talked about several parts of this bill.

1507
03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:31.000
I'm definitely on board with this, and I certainly recognize the importance of the work that Representative Ladd and Senator Waters and you have put in on this.

1508
03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:37.500
However, Section 4 is really what I'm sort of stumbling over right now.

1509
03:22:37.500 --> 03:22:50.000
And I've actually got, in trying to sort out what Section 4 means, I think I probably have half the sentences underlined at this point.

1510
03:22:50.000 --> 03:23:00.000
trying to and this could be a Friday after lunch type of, you know, fog, but I don't think so.

1511
03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:03.000
But, for example, for example, Dr.

1512
03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:23.000
Beard, just at line 17 on page 2, that begins, the rigor and number of graduation competencies and credits earned towards graduation shall align with the equivalent of the credits as outlined in the minimum standards for public school approval.

1513
03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000
So that's in here.

1514
03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000
Yes.

1515
03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:37.500
And as approved for the core course, and I'm not quite sure where that ties back to, by the sending district.

1516
03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:56.500
So the assumption is that the core course, whether it's a math course, a science course, et cetera, offered by the sending district aligns with the requirements that are outlined in the minimum standards for public school approval.

1517
03:23:56.500 --> 03:23:58.500
So there's that assumption.

1518
03:23:58.500 --> 03:24:05.500
Now, we know that the local requirement could go further than the minimum standards.

1519
03:24:05.500 --> 03:24:12.000
So it's really a yes-and proposition of saying, begin with the minimum standards.

1520
03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:25.500
Does the embedded course offering align with those standards so that you can determine that you can, in fact, award, say, chemistry credit for a cosmetology program?

1521
03:24:25.500 --> 03:24:38.500
In addition, does it align with the core requirements for credit in the sending school course if it goes beyond what's included in the minimum standards?

1522
03:24:38.500 --> 03:24:41.000
So a follow-up on that?

1523
03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000
Yes.

1524
03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:49.000
So let's take the example that you just set out here, Dr.

1525
03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:55.000
Beard, where you're awarding a chemistry credit for a CTE cosmetology course.

1526
03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:04.000
Is that because the cosmetology course contains all of the competencies that is contained in the chemistry class?

1527
03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:07.500
For full credit, it would need to.

1528
03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:19.000
In other words, for it to be full credit, it would have to be the equivalent of what's being offered for full credit.

1529
03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:25.500
That is why there is a provision in this bill for partial credit.

1530
03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:28.500
And that was my earlier question.

1531
03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:30.500
Yes, exactly.

1532
03:25:30.500 --> 03:26:03.000
So in other words, if you could say of the, let's say, eight required competencies for science, this course satisfies three of them, then you could determine, and again, this is something that happens as part of negotiation, to say we'd be willing to give a partial credit, let's give a half credit out of a three credit course that the young person could earn.

1533
03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:34.000
And then through sort of a, I'm trying to think of the best way to word this, over the course of a two-year CTE program and then maybe an additional workplace learning opportunity, a young person could sort of cobble together all of the competencies required for a science course through the entire CTE experience, as opposed to taking one science course.

1534
03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:46.000
They could take a number of courses in CTE that include competencies that would be the equivalent of the credit for that science course.

1535
03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:48.000
Okay.

1536
03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:50.500
No, thanks for that explanation.

1537
03:26:50.500 --> 03:26:52.500
I think that helps.

1538
03:26:52.500 --> 03:27:09.000
I'm, you know, again, trying to get a better understanding, I guess, and maybe we don't have all of the resources to be able to understand that right here on a Friday afternoon.

1539
03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:14.000
But it sort of gets back to that unbundled competencies.

1540
03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:36.500
And if, let's say, my chemistry class requires me to understand, you know, requires me to demonstrate competency in five particular areas, what you're suggesting is that maybe one or two CT or more CTE courses could demonstrate competencies in, what did I say, five?

1541
03:27:36.500 --> 03:27:38.500
Thank you.

1542
03:27:38.500 --> 03:27:40.500
areas.

1543
03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:53.000
What you're suggesting is that maybe one or two CTE or more CTE courses could demonstrate competencies in, what did I say, five particular areas.

1544
03:27:53.000 --> 03:28:12.500
And, you know, I'm not an education expert, so I don't know if those competencies are better mastered together or can they be mastered in as robust a fashion through multiple courses or programs that are not bundled together?

1545
03:28:12.500 --> 03:28:26.000
Well, and I think the easiest way for me to explain it is that simply put, a competency is what somebody knows and is able to do.

1546
03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:34.000
So it has to be something that is demonstrable, something that can show evidence of proficiency.

1547
03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:38.000
So because of that, competencies don't necessarily build.

1548
03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:40.000
They're not necessarily sequential.

1549
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:53.500
And there were times when somebody can demonstrate ability to a certain degree and then take some steps back and then need to build it up again.

1550
03:28:53.500 --> 03:29:10.000
So competency is something that is something that's revisited often, it's assessed often, and it's something that is better suited to a set of experiences as opposed to something that is more limited.

1551
03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:22.000
So in many ways, having the entire program might give more opportunities to attain competency and demonstrate proficiency than having, say, the semester-length class.

1552
03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:24.000
Okay, fair enough.

1553
03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:28.000
I mean, I think that's a good answer.

1554
03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:31.000
Thank you very much for that.

1555
03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000
That's great.

1556
03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:36.000
I think I'm good for now.

1557
03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:38.500
Okay, thank you very much.

1558
03:29:38.500 --> 03:29:40.500
Any further questions?

1559
03:29:40.500 --> 03:29:42.500
Representative Porter?

1560
03:29:42.500 --> 03:29:45.500
Thank you very much for that.

1561
03:29:45.500 --> 03:29:47.500
That's great.

1562
03:29:47.500 --> 03:29:50.500
I think I'm good for now.

1563
03:29:50.500 --> 03:29:52.500
Okay.

1564
03:29:52.500 --> 03:29:54.500
Thank you very much.

1565
03:29:54.500 --> 03:29:56.500
Any further questions?

1566
03:29:56.500 --> 03:29:58.500
Representative Porter.

1567
03:29:58.500 --> 03:30:00.500
Thank you, Mr.

1568
03:30:00.500 --> 03:30:02.500
Chair.

1569
03:30:02.500 --> 03:30:05.000
I'm finding this very interesting.

1570
03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:12.500
So what happens if a course at a CTE includes three of the eight proficiencies?

1571
03:30:12.500 --> 03:30:18.500
What the other five, how does the student get to meet those?

1572
03:30:18.500 --> 03:30:33.500
if they're not part of the CTE program and he's not in the full course at his high school, where is he going to get those other five competencies from?

1573
03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:35.500
That's an excellent question.

1574
03:30:35.500 --> 03:30:38.500
There are a number of ways.

1575
03:30:38.500 --> 03:30:51.500
One of the beauties of education in the state of New Hampshire is that we do have a lot of opportunities and a lot of options.

1576
03:30:51.500 --> 03:31:02.000
So in addition to doing CTE programming, they could take a course at their high school, at the Sunning High School.

1577
03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:08.000
They could take a course through the virtual learning charter school, VLAX.

1578
03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:15.000
They could engage with a learn everywhere opportunity or do an extended learning opportunity.

1579
03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:29.000
So there's a number of ways that a young person could piece together the competencies for graduation credit and would not necessarily be constrained by a single course.

1580
03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:43.000
But it wouldn't be up to the sending school to provide an opportunity for that kid to meet those five competencies outside of the courses that they offer.

1581
03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:46.000
No, they would not have to.

1582
03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:48.500
Representative Tanner, possibly last question?

1583
03:31:48.500 --> 03:31:50.500
Okay, last question.

1584
03:31:50.500 --> 03:32:21.000
So to go back to my example before about the chemistry, so when I look at, for example, the handbook that my school has, the beginning of it has, you know, in order to graduate from our school, you need, you know, two credits of science, three credits of math, so many credits of English, and they're just listed as that.

1585
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:27.500
So let's take somebody in cosmetology or maybe pre-nursing, that kind of thing.

1586
03:32:27.500 --> 03:32:39.500
And they obviously are not doing just chemistry or just, you know, I mean, they're working with chemicals or, you know, whatever, blood areas.

1587
03:32:39.500 --> 03:33:05.000
and so when the credit gets gets transferred back to the school when the school accepts the competencies is it recorded in the transcript is what I'm worried about So when the credit gets transferred back to the school, when the school accepts the competencies, is it recorded in the transcript?

1588
03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:41.500
What I'm worried about, I guess the underlying thing is, I'll tell you what I'm worried about, because to put it into a question seems like I'm unfolding, folding, and unfolding, is again that I'm worried that some of the students who go into CTE who then decide or who realize that they're going into CTE as a pathway to a college degree that they have to get to be in a profession.

1589
03:33:41.500 --> 03:34:03.500
And I know because I've had some students that were really interested in doing that and then applied to the college and had to go into general ed instead of the major that they wanted because they didn't have the courses on their transcript.

1590
03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:57.500
So when this comes through on their transcript, does it just say they've reached the competencies in science and it's not broken down by biology or physics or chemistry you know I guess that's my question it's a great question because of the nature of how the these local control the the term we always we always do every district would have a different transcript every district would have a different way of reporting that What I will share is that increasingly institutions of higher ed are more attuned to competency-based education and are more open to looking at what the young person can bring to their program.

1591
03:34:57.500 --> 03:35:00.000
They're always looking for fit.

1592
03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:12.000
So I think that that's something that, while it's a worthy concern, it's something that I think will resolve itself as this gets implemented.

1593
03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:14.000
Thank you very much.

1594
03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:17.500
Seeing no further questions, thank you, Dr.

1595
03:35:17.500 --> 03:35:19.500
Beard.

1596
03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:24.000
I don't see any other cards at this point.

1597
03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:29.000
Was there anyone else at present who wanted to testify?

1598
03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:34.500
Seeing none, I will close the hearing on House Bill 1661.

1599
03:35:34.500 --> 03:35:40.500
And we'll prepare for the next bill, which is House Bill 1283.

1600
03:35:40.500 --> 03:35:42.500
Thank you.

1601
03:35:42.500 --> 03:35:44.500
Thank you.

1602
03:35:44.500 --> 03:35:46.500
Thank you.

1603
03:35:46.500 --> 03:35:48.500
Thank you.

1604
03:35:48.500 --> 03:35:50.500
Thank you.

1605
03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:52.500
Thank you.

1606
03:35:52.500 --> 03:35:54.500
Thank you.

1607
03:35:54.500 --> 03:35:57.500
I'm all ready for you, Mr.

1608
03:35:57.500 --> 03:35:59.500
Chair.

1609
03:35:59.500 --> 03:36:04.000
Oh, I didn't, I'm not ready for the clerk.

1610
03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000
I'm sorry.

1611
03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:08.000
Thank you.

1612
03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:10.000
the clerk.

1613
03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:12.000
I'm sorry.

1614
03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.000
I know.

1615
03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000
Really.

1616
03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:18.000
Did I get the?

1617
03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:20.000
Absolutely.

1618
03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.000
Absolutely.

1619
03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:24.000
Almost got really punched.

1620
03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:26.000
Long week.

1621
03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:32.000
Okay, we're ready to go ahead and continue our hearings for today.

1622
03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:40.500
Okay, 1283 is a bill relative to liability as taxable income of an education freedom account payments.

1623
03:36:40.500 --> 03:36:46.500
Okay, and we recognize Representative Luno, the prime sponsor of the bill.

1624
03:36:46.500 --> 03:36:48.500
Terrific.

1625
03:36:48.500 --> 03:36:51.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

1626
03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:54.000
Chair and members of the committee.

1627
03:36:54.000 --> 03:37:00.000
For the record, Dave Luno, representing the people of Huffington and Concord.

1628
03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:11.500
And you might recall earlier, but this morning I introduced a bill that would help prevent fraud in the Education Freedom Account program.

1629
03:37:11.500 --> 03:37:36.000
And there's a difference when it comes to fraudulent use of taxpayer money to buy a jet ski using the EFA dollars, like what happened in another state, and using taxpayer-funded education freedom counts in New Hampshire to pay for things that could lead to child abuse and neglect.

1630
03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:39.500
That was a lot more than housekeeping.

1631
03:37:39.500 --> 03:37:42.500
That was a very important bill.

1632
03:37:42.500 --> 03:37:54.000
I think this is an important bill as well, but unlike the earlier bill today, House Bill 1283 is really more about housekeeping.

1633
03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:56.000
It's really simple.

1634
03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:12.500
It repeals the one line in RSA 194 F2 Roman 6 that reads, quote, funds deposited in an EFA shall not constitute taxable income to the parent or the EFA student, end quote.

1635
03:38:12.500 --> 03:38:20.000
So, and obviously the way the bill is drafted, it has repeal language in there.

1636
03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:26.000
So repeal language typically does not show the language that's being repealed.

1637
03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:43.000
So that's what I just read to you, that 194 F colon 2 part, or Roman 6, funds upon the EFA shall not constitute taxable income to the parent or to the EFA student.

1638
03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:47.000
So let's pause on that for a second.

1639
03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:53.500
Is New Hampshire saying that EFA funds are not subject to federal tax?

1640
03:38:53.500 --> 03:38:56.500
I guess I don't really know.

1641
03:38:56.500 --> 03:39:07.500
So I think this is where the state of New Hampshire is in a position where we need to make things clear.

1642
03:39:07.500 --> 03:39:16.500
I'm not here to say that EFA payments are subject to federal tax or exempt from federal tax.

1643
03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:18.500
I'll say it again.

1644
03:39:18.500 --> 03:39:27.500
I'm not saying that EFA payments are not considered to be taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service.

1645
03:39:27.500 --> 03:39:35.000
In fact, I'm not even suggesting that the payments should or should not be taxable.

1646
03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:37.500
It's not up to me.

1647
03:39:37.500 --> 03:39:50.500
The Internal Revenue Service does actually run a web page titled, Do I Include My Scholarship, Fellowship, or Education Grant as Income on My Tax Return?

1648
03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:57.000
So you can actually find that page by probably searching on those words.

1649
03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:05.500
And it includes a tool to determine whether a scholarship deposit or distribution is taxable or not.

1650
03:40:05.500 --> 03:40:14.000
In any case, it's not our role to determine what is or isn't taxable under federal law.

1651
03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:28.000
And more to the point, we should not provide bad information in the event it is bad information to our constituents when it comes to federal tax liabilities.

1652
03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:30.000
That's clearly deceptive.

1653
03:40:30.000 --> 03:41:02.500
At the federal level, and this goes to actually the handout I passed around, and I'll reference it in a second, but at the federal level, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has filed legislation in each of the past three sessions of Congress to amend the federal tax code to make education freedom accounts free of federal tax liability to the student or their family.

1654
03:41:02.500 --> 03:41:10.000
And you can see that if you go to page 9 of Senator Cruz's bill.

1655
03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:17.500
And on page 9, lines 16 through 22, it clearly states, not treated as income.

1656
03:41:17.500 --> 03:41:34.000
The amount of any such scholarship shall not be treated as income of the student or their parents for purposes of federal tax laws or for determining eligibility for any other federal program.

1657
03:41:34.000 --> 03:41:42.500
That's in the bill proposed and offered by Senator Cruz over the last three sessions of Congress.

1658
03:41:42.500 --> 03:41:47.500
The issue here, though, is the legislation hasn't been passed.

1659
03:41:47.500 --> 03:41:50.000
So what does this mean?

1660
03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:52.000
Well, good question.

1661
03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:57.500
Maybe it means that EFA payments are taxable under federal law.

1662
03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:01.500
Why else would Senator Cruz file the legislation?

1663
03:42:01.500 --> 03:42:10.000
But more substantive research into this hasn't really definitively indicated to me whether it is or isn't.

1664
03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:12.500
Tax law is really complicated.

1665
03:42:12.500 --> 03:42:17.500
So as an engineer, I can actually attest to that.

1666
03:42:17.500 --> 03:42:28.500
But I don't have an LLM in tax or the tax chops to get into the weeds of the federal tax code.

1667
03:42:28.500 --> 03:42:33.500
As a taxpayer, I know that some income is taxable.

1668
03:42:33.500 --> 03:42:39.000
I know that some expenses can be deducted from certain income.

1669
03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:45.000
For example, a 529 distribution used for tuition has no tax liability.

1670
03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:52.000
But a 529 distribution used to buy a laptop is subject to federal tax.

1671
03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:55.000
So what does it all mean?

1672
03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.500
I keep asking that question.

1673
03:42:57.500 --> 03:43:14.000
It means we should probably recommend this bill as ought to pass so that we're not providing misinformation and deceiving EFA families when it comes to the tax liability that may be incurred.

1674
03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:26.000
It's also come to my attention later, it was sort of middle of the day today, that the IRS does put out a publication.

1675
03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:28.500
I believe it's called 790.

1676
03:43:28.500 --> 03:43:36.000
And, of course, like many IRS publications, it's got a lot of pages to it.

1677
03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:57.500
And I did find terms right on the first, I think it was page five of that publication that defines what eligible educational services are and what is taxable and not subject to tax when it refers to scholarships for these education institutions.

1678
03:43:57.500 --> 03:44:03.000
And I think all of that is worthy of additional consideration.

1679
03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:15.000
but again what this bill does is not remove anything but does not change 194F in any material way that changes the program whatsoever.

1680
03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:28.500
And it does not change any EFA student or family's potential for tax liability or not when it comes to a distribution or deposit to the EFA.

1681
03:44:28.500 --> 03:44:36.000
All it does is take out a line that could be misleading to the public.

1682
03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:42.500
And I thank you very much, and I'm happy to take the question.

1683
03:44:42.500 --> 03:44:44.500
Thank you very much.

1684
03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:48.000
Are there any questions for Representative Luno?

1685
03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:50.000
Representative Cordelli.

1686
03:44:50.000 --> 03:44:52.000
Thank you, Mr.

1687
03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:54.000
Chairman.

1688
03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000
Thank you very much.

1689
03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:59.500
Are there any questions for Representative Luno?

1690
03:44:59.500 --> 03:45:01.500
Representative Cordelli.

1691
03:45:01.500 --> 03:45:03.500
Thank you, Mr.

1692
03:45:03.500 --> 03:45:05.500
Chairman.

1693
03:45:05.500 --> 03:45:07.500
Thank you, Representative.

1694
03:45:07.500 --> 03:45:15.000
I believe there's half dozen, maybe seven states with existing EFA programs at this point.

1695
03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:27.000
Do you have any idea if any family receiving an education savings account or education freedom account has been taxed by the federal government?

1696
03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:30.000
So I've asked around on that.

1697
03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:36.500
That's a great question, Representative Cordelli, and thank you for bringing that up.

1698
03:45:36.500 --> 03:45:54.500
I've asked around, and it's really unclear as to whether anybody's even receiving 1099s on these education freedom accounts, as the term is used in New Hampshire law, and is actually used on Senator Cruz's bill.

1699
03:45:54.500 --> 03:45:58.000
It uses the term education freedom account.

1700
03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:22.500
So I think this is such a new area that the federal law has not caught up with it, whether either to clarify the tax liability status one way or the other, or to provide definitive guidance to students and their families, even when using the scholarship calculator tool.

1701
03:46:22.500 --> 03:46:36.000
But I think everybody at one time or another probably filled out some version of a personal income tax, and generally speaking, there's two parts to it.

1702
03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:43.000
There's the income part of it, and then there's the deductible part of it.

1703
03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:54.000
And so really there's a couple of questions that I think are important for our federal, for the Congress to identify here.

1704
03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:03.500
And the first piece is what is the taxability status of the payments that come through these scholarship accounts?

1705
03:47:03.500 --> 03:47:11.500
And then secondly, what is the deductibility status for use of those payments for certain expenses?

1706
03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:17.000
And like I mentioned, even on 529s, certain expenses are deductible.

1707
03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:20.000
Certain expenses are not tax deductible.

1708
03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:25.000
So I think it gets really complicated very, very quickly.

1709
03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:27.000
I apologize.

1710
03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:32.000
I should go back and get an LLM in tax.

1711
03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:42.500
But from the time I filed this bill until the time we're presenting it today, that was not going to happen.

1712
03:47:42.500 --> 03:47:45.000
You have a follow-up question?

1713
03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:47.000
Yes, thank you.

1714
03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:52.500
We have a little bit more time until the exec session.

1715
03:47:52.500 --> 03:47:55.000
I like these Friday afternoon.

1716
03:47:55.000 --> 03:48:01.000
You're supposed to come back and say, well, get used to it.

1717
03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000
I hope not.

1718
03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:07.000
Sometimes to look at history is very instructive.

1719
03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:17.000
And actually, the Arizona ESA program is 10 years old, and there are several states that are five years old.

1720
03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:33.500
And would you believe that I talked with the vice president and legal counsel for EdChoice, and they know of no one in the country who has been taxed on their ESA program.

1721
03:48:33.500 --> 03:48:41.500
Yeah, I would believe that because I found it very difficult to actually get that information.

1722
03:48:41.500 --> 03:48:57.500
But at the same time, in talking with two tax experts in this state, they were not able to point to anything in the tax code that would support that tax-exempt conclusion.

1723
03:48:57.500 --> 03:48:59.500
Go ahead.

1724
03:48:59.500 --> 03:49:08.500
Would you believe that all of those state bills contain this exact same language about not being taxable?

1725
03:49:08.500 --> 03:49:19.000
I would very much believe it because I'm sure New Hampshire's language was somehow modeled on some of those states' language.

1726
03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:27.000
But again, none of those states are in the position where they establish federal tax code.

1727
03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:42.500
So I would simply say that until the Feds get this matter adjudicated, that they might also be misleading their constituents the same way we're doing that here in New Hampshire.

1728
03:49:42.500 --> 03:49:45.000
Any further questions, Representative Luno?

1729
03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000
Yes, Representative Licas.

1730
03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:49.000
Thank you.

1731
03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:51.000
I'm curious.

1732
03:49:51.000 --> 03:50:08.500
This is the same state money that we send to traditional public schools, and the EFAs we're recognizing in the state as a school, a way of satisfying our 180 days, all that other stuff.

1733
03:50:08.500 --> 03:50:17.500
It's just there are now four different ways rather than three different ways where you can satisfy that.

1734
03:50:17.500 --> 03:50:20.000
And it's the same money.

1735
03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:23.500
So do the towns have to pay?

1736
03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:28.500
Are the individuals in the towns who are the students?

1737
03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:40.500
Because it's per student that it goes to the towns, are they also responsible for paying taxes, and how is this different than that?

1738
03:50:40.500 --> 03:50:45.500
The students on EFAs don't get money sent to them.

1739
03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:47.500
They mostly get reimbursements.

1740
03:50:47.500 --> 03:50:50.500
It's towards their education, et cetera.

1741
03:50:50.500 --> 03:51:10.000
I'm not sure why, since it's the same money going to a school in the state of New Hampshire, a way of doing school in the state of New Hampshire, why would one be taxed and not the other?

1742
03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:13.500
No, I think that's a great question.

1743
03:51:13.500 --> 03:51:52.000
And when I ask that question to people that do have an LLM in tax, I've gotten a very, very uniform, consistent response from these tax experts who say, no distributions from from the state directly to municipalities or to school districts are not taxable by the municipality or the school district as revenue going into those political subdivisions, no revenue going into those political subdivisions are subject to tax to be paid by those political subdivisions.

1744
03:51:52.000 --> 03:52:05.000
But in the case of an education freedom account, the payment's actually being directed at the determination of the EFA student or the EFA student's family.

1745
03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:17.500
So it's very different than the case of, let's say, an adequacy grant going from the state to a municipality or to a school district.

1746
03:52:17.500 --> 03:52:28.000
And it's the fact that it's directed at the discretion of the family that in fact makes it a taxable transaction.

1747
03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:30.000
Thank you.

1748
03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:32.000
Are there further questions?

1749
03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:34.000
Not seeing any.

1750
03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:36.000
Thank you very much.

1751
03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:38.000
Great.

1752
03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:40.000
Thank you very much.

1753
03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:42.000
Or me?

1754
03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:45.000
Oh, I didn't see Representative Porter.

1755
03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:47.000
Thank you, Mr.

1756
03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:49.000
Chair.

1757
03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:51.500
This is a would-you-believe question.

1758
03:52:51.500 --> 03:52:53.500
Thank you very much.

1759
03:52:53.500 --> 03:52:55.500
Great.

1760
03:52:55.500 --> 03:52:57.500
Thank you very much.

1761
03:52:57.500 --> 03:52:59.500
Or me?

1762
03:52:59.500 --> 03:53:02.000
Oh, I didn't see you.

1763
03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:04.000
Representative Porter?

1764
03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:06.000
Thank you, Mr.

1765
03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:08.000
Chair.

1766
03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:11.500
This is a would you believe question.

1767
03:53:11.500 --> 03:53:14.000
My daughter attended graduate school.

1768
03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:17.500
I'm very proud of this, Cornell University.

1769
03:53:17.500 --> 03:53:23.500
And she had a National Science Foundation grant, which paid her tuition.

1770
03:53:23.500 --> 03:53:30.500
Every year she got this grant to live on, and that was totally taxable.

1771
03:53:30.500 --> 03:53:38.000
The grant that she got from the federal government, she had to pay taxes on.

1772
03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:45.500
So just to enlighten you, the group, a little bit, that was considered taxable income.

1773
03:53:45.500 --> 03:54:04.500
So thank you very much, and I guess what I'd like to do is go back and take a look at the IRS 790 publication and see where that is, because I'm sure that's laid out very clearly.

1774
03:54:04.500 --> 03:54:07.500
Okay, are there any further questions?

1775
03:54:07.500 --> 03:54:21.500
I did, but then I realized it was actually to Rep Porter that I wanted to ask the question and not Luno, and I can't do that now.

1776
03:54:21.500 --> 03:54:24.000
No, we can't do that.

1777
03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:26.000
So, no.

1778
03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:28.000
Thank you.

1779
03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:30.000
Great.

1780
03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:32.000
Thank you very much.

1781
03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:34.000
Thanks very much.

1782
03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:40.500
Are there any other folks who would like to testify on this bill?

1783
03:54:40.500 --> 03:54:42.500
Pink card in?

1784
03:54:42.500 --> 03:54:44.500
Okay.

1785
03:54:44.500 --> 03:54:46.500
Where's the pink card?

1786
03:54:46.500 --> 03:54:52.000
You know you have to do it for every bill, right?

1787
03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:54.000
Okay.

1788
03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:56.000
Thank you.

1789
03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:14.000
For the rest of the committee here, I think what we ought to do is put Representative Luno and Representative Cordelli in that room there, close doors, and you guys come out of there with resolution.

1790
03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:16.000
Okay.

1791
03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:20.500
It's Friday afternoon, but we do have one more.

1792
03:55:20.500 --> 03:55:23.500
Matt Southerton, you have the floor.

1793
03:55:23.500 --> 03:55:25.500
All right.

1794
03:55:25.500 --> 03:55:27.500
Thank you, Matt Southerton.

1795
03:55:27.500 --> 03:55:33.000
With the Children's Scholarship Fund, we'll try to make this brief.

1796
03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:37.500
I think that there's some confusion over federal grants.

1797
03:55:37.500 --> 03:55:39.500
Mr.

1798
03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:41.500
Chair, excuse me.

1799
03:55:41.500 --> 03:55:44.000
Could you move the mic?

1800
03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:46.000
I can't.

1801
03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:48.000
Yeah, sorry about that.

1802
03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:54.000
I think there's some confusion over federal grants and the EFA fund.

1803
03:55:54.000 --> 03:56:06.000
So the EFA fund was, the Education Freedom Account Fund was established to enable parents to use EFA grant funds for education related opportunities.

1804
03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:10.500
So it's very, very similar to a Pell Grant.

1805
03:56:10.500 --> 03:56:22.500
If you know what a federal Pell Grant is, a federal Pell Grant is tax-deductible as long as you use it for education-related expenses.

1806
03:56:22.500 --> 03:56:29.500
A federal Pell Grant also allows you to use it for non-educational related expenses.

1807
03:56:29.500 --> 03:56:36.000
However, those items or services that you purchase with those monies are taxable.

1808
03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:47.500
Unlike the federal Pell Grant, the EFA account does not allow you to purchase items or services that are not education related expenses.

1809
03:56:47.500 --> 03:56:50.000
So that is the difference.

1810
03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:52.000
Thus, it's not taxed.

1811
03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:54.000
Thank you very much.

1812
03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:56.000
Representative Porter.

1813
03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:58.000
Thank you, Mr.

1814
03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:02.500
Chair, and thank you for taking my question, sir.

1815
03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:10.500
So why does Senator Cruz have a bill in that will make it not be taxable?

1816
03:57:10.500 --> 03:57:13.000
Well, I could only speculate.

1817
03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:15.000
Well, please do.

1818
03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:30.000
I would assume that I could speculate, but I would assume that perhaps his bill wants to allow families to use or to purchase items that are not strictly educational.

1819
03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:39.000
Perhaps they want to use it for boarding or other items, which we wouldn't allow in this case.

1820
03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:41.000
Go ahead.

1821
03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:47.500
So while I have you here, this is a little off the topic.

1822
03:57:47.500 --> 03:57:58.000
I know that from what I've read in the press that the average grant is, EFA grant is somewhere around $4,700.

1823
03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:00.000
Correct.

1824
03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:02.000
Okay.

1825
03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:04.000
That's per student.

1826
03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:06.000
Correct.

1827
03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:08.000
Okay.

1828
03:58:08.000 --> 03:58:15.000
So if a family has five students, are they getting five times that grant?

1829
03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:19.000
It would depend because there are individual factors.

1830
03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:23.500
So the base aid is approximately $3,400 per pupil.

1831
03:58:23.500 --> 03:58:27.000
But then again, there are individual factors.

1832
03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:32.500
Does that family, do they qualify for free and reduce lunch?

1833
03:58:32.500 --> 03:58:39.000
Are they extremely poor and do they qualify for free and reduced lunch?

1834
03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:47.000
Are they extremely poor, and do they qualify for that so they would receive additional monies?

1835
03:58:47.000 --> 03:58:49.000
Let's see.

1836
03:58:49.000 --> 03:58:52.500
Do they have children with special needs?

1837
03:58:52.500 --> 03:58:55.500
They would qualify for additional money.

1838
03:58:55.500 --> 03:59:06.000
So right now, I can only give you that one base number, or not the base number, but the average number.

1839
03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:21.000
Follow-up So if it's $4,700 per child average, and a family has five children at their homeschooling, they're getting five EFA payments of $4,700 each for each child they're homeschooling?

1840
03:59:21.000 --> 03:59:24.500
If they are all in the EFA.

1841
03:59:24.500 --> 03:59:27.500
They're all qualified for the EFA.FA.

1842
03:59:27.500 --> 03:59:29.500
They're all set.

1843
03:59:29.500 --> 03:59:35.000
They don't have a whole bunch of special needs or anything.

1844
03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:38.000
All the kids are the same.

1845
03:59:38.000 --> 03:59:40.000
They're all homeschooled.

1846
03:59:40.000 --> 03:59:43.000
They're all getting the average payment.

1847
03:59:43.000 --> 03:59:45.500
They all get the $4,700.

1848
03:59:45.500 --> 03:59:52.500
If they're not special needs and they're not FRL, they would get around $3,400.

1849
03:59:52.500 --> 03:59:56.500
So they were all getting 5 times $3,700?

1850
03:59:56.500 --> 03:59:58.500
Correct.

1851
03:59:58.500 --> 04:00:00.500
Thank you.

1852
04:00:00.500 --> 04:00:02.500
Further questions?

1853
04:00:02.500 --> 04:00:04.500
Representative Litchfield.

1854
04:00:04.500 --> 04:00:07.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1855
04:00:07.500 --> 04:00:46.000
I just wanted to confirm, just in that example, if we're talking about the five children, and let's say they all qualify for the $3,700, if they were to attend to the public school in New Hampshire with that 3700 per child have gone directly to the public school so therefore either way we're spending the money to educate a child yeah exactly and you're saving you're saving a tremendous amount at the local level right right?

1856
04:00:46.000 --> 04:00:50.000
Because you're educating that student for less money.

1857
04:00:50.000 --> 04:00:52.000
Oh, exactly.

1858
04:00:52.000 --> 04:00:54.000
Thank you.

1859
04:00:54.000 --> 04:00:56.000
Thank you.

1860
04:00:56.000 --> 04:00:58.000
Are there further questions?

1861
04:00:58.000 --> 04:01:00.000
Thank you very much.

1862
04:01:00.000 --> 04:01:04.000
I don't think I didn't see anything else.

1863
04:01:04.000 --> 04:01:06.000
No.

1864
04:01:06.000 --> 04:01:08.000
Thank you.

1865
04:01:08.000 --> 04:01:10.000
Thank you.

1866
04:01:10.000 --> 04:01:13.000
Are there any other pink cards?

1867
04:01:13.000 --> 04:01:15.000
Not seeing any.

1868
04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:17.000
this hearing is closed.

1869
04:01:17.000 --> 04:01:19.000
Thank you.

1870
04:01:19.000 --> 04:01:22.000
I'll try and bring it in.

1871
04:01:22.000 --> 04:01:24.500
Are you starting right now?

1872
04:01:24.500 --> 04:01:26.500
Thank you.

1873
04:01:26.500 --> 04:01:28.500
Thank you.

1874
04:01:28.500 --> 04:01:30.500
Thank you.

1875
04:01:30.500 --> 04:01:32.500
Thank you.

1876
04:01:32.500 --> 04:01:34.500
Thank you.

1877
04:01:34.500 --> 04:01:36.500
Thank you.

1878
04:01:36.500 --> 04:01:38.500
Thank you.

1879
04:01:38.500 --> 04:01:40.500
Thank you.

1880
04:01:40.500 --> 04:01:42.500
Thank you.

1881
04:01:42.500 --> 04:01:44.500
Thank you, Mr.

1882
04:01:44.500 --> 04:01:46.500
Chair.

1883
04:01:46.500 --> 04:01:55.500
And I did pass in my pink card first thing this morning, so I wouldn't be embarrassed again.

1884
04:01:55.500 --> 04:02:09.500
For the record, my name is Marjorie Porter, and I represent Hillsborough District 1 and the good people of Antrim, Hillsborough, and Windsor, the Switzerland of New England.

1885
04:02:09.500 --> 04:02:15.500
Seriously, in our historical society, there is a plaque on the wall.

1886
04:02:15.500 --> 04:02:30.000
I think it must have been like the 1920s, but that's how it was advertised, because we had a lot of cross-country skiing in the area at that time.

1887
04:02:30.000 --> 04:02:36.000
First off, I want to make some things clear to this committee.

1888
04:02:36.000 --> 04:02:38.500
I am not anti-religious schools.

1889
04:02:38.500 --> 04:02:41.000
Children of Italian Catholic immigrants.

1890
04:02:41.000 --> 04:02:45.500
And in school, they experienced discrimination because of it.

1891
04:02:45.500 --> 04:02:50.000
They wanted us to be proud of our heritage.

1892
04:02:50.000 --> 04:03:02.000
And so they sent my sisters and me to Venarini Academy in Worcester, Mass., a parochial school run by an order of Italian nuns.

1893
04:03:02.000 --> 04:03:06.000
I could tell you some really good stories.

1894
04:03:06.000 --> 04:03:22.000
This must have been a real hardship for them, though, as they had lost everything that they owned as the result of a horrific tornado that swept through the region in 1953.

1895
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:24.000
They had nothing left.

1896
04:03:24.000 --> 04:03:29.500
But it was important to them, so they made it work.

1897
04:03:29.500 --> 04:03:33.000
And I'm not against private schools either.

1898
04:03:33.000 --> 04:03:42.500
In fact, my husband and I owned and operated a private preschool and kindergarten for 12 years before retiring.

1899
04:03:42.500 --> 04:03:54.500
It was hardly profit-making as we kept our rates low to make it affordable, and we offered tuition assistance to those who needed it.

1900
04:03:54.500 --> 04:04:05.500
And I certainly understand the need for families to find an alternative to public schools to meet the needs of their children.

1901
04:04:05.500 --> 04:04:11.500
My own two children attended the same public school where I taught.

1902
04:04:11.500 --> 04:04:17.000
My daughter was fine with it, but not so my son.

1903
04:04:17.000 --> 04:04:26.500
He was experiencing difficulties, so we sent him to a local private school until he reached middle school age.

1904
04:04:26.500 --> 04:04:30.500
It was good that we had that option.

1905
04:04:30.500 --> 04:04:39.000
And finally, I am not a constitutional lawyer, or a lawyer of any type, for that matter.

1906
04:04:39.000 --> 04:04:57.500
When I mentioned that to the good people at OLS, they explained to me that in New Hampshire, the goal always has been to write our laws in such a way that ordinary people can understand them.

1907
04:04:57.500 --> 04:05:00.500
No need for a law degree.

1908
04:05:00.500 --> 04:05:05.000
All you needed was to be able to read.

1909
04:05:05.000 --> 04:05:09.500
That goes for the state constitution too, he said.

1910
04:05:09.500 --> 04:05:14.000
I can read and I have read the constitution.

1911
04:05:14.000 --> 04:05:25.500
I have filed this bill because I believe the use of locally raised property taxes to fund scholarships to religious schools is unconstitutional.

1912
04:05:25.500 --> 04:05:31.000
It needs to be made clear in our laws as well.

1913
04:05:31.000 --> 04:05:37.000
I have provided everyone copies of several pages of our state constitution.

1914
04:05:37.000 --> 04:05:45.000
The first two pages include part one, articles one through 11 of our Bill of Rights.

1915
04:05:45.000 --> 04:05:57.500
If you look at the dates of passage, you will see that most all of them were passed in 1784, when our Constitution was established.

1916
04:05:57.500 --> 04:06:02.000
Please look at the top of the second page.

1917
04:06:02.000 --> 04:06:04.500
Article 6, Morality and Piety.

1918
04:06:04.500 --> 04:06:11.500
I have underlined the relevant sentence and I have circled the date of passage.

1919
04:06:11.500 --> 04:06:14.500
Let me read it to you.

1920
04:06:14.500 --> 04:06:24.500
But no person shall ever be compelled to pay towards the support of the schools of any sect or denomination.

1921
04:06:24.500 --> 04:06:30.000
That prohibition has been in our Constitution since its very start.

1922
04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:38.000
If you turn to page three, you will see part two, article 83 of our Constitution.

1923
04:06:38.000 --> 04:06:45.000
It too has been there since the beginning, but it has been amended twice.

1924
04:06:45.000 --> 04:06:48.000
The first time was in 1877.

1925
04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:55.000
This is two years after James Blaine from Maine first proposed his infamous amendment.

1926
04:06:55.000 --> 04:07:00.500
This is our Blaine Amendment we have heard so much about.

1927
04:07:00.500 --> 04:07:03.500
It's been called the Anti-Catholic Amendment.

1928
04:07:03.500 --> 04:07:11.000
I agree this is not nice, but nonetheless it is still part of our Constitution.

1929
04:07:11.000 --> 04:07:14.500
Allow me to read it to you.

1930
04:07:14.500 --> 04:07:18.000
I'm sure I don't have the page.

1931
04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:20.000
Oh, here it is.

1932
04:07:20.000 --> 04:07:34.000
Provided, nevertheless, that no money raised by taxation shall ever be granted or applied for the use of the schools of institutions of any religious sect or denomination.

1933
04:07:34.000 --> 04:07:39.500
My husband and I have been retired for a while now.

1934
04:07:39.500 --> 04:07:49.000
We live on Social Security and a very small teacher pensions because neither one of us were fully vested.

1935
04:07:49.000 --> 04:07:56.500
Sometimes it is hard to come up with the money to pay our property taxes.

1936
04:07:56.500 --> 04:08:16.000
When we send our checks to the town twice a year, I know the town will take our money and use it for the police department, the fire department, the library, the roads, and the local community public schools.

1937
04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:20.500
In my town, there is a small Christian school.

1938
04:08:20.500 --> 04:08:29.500
It's been around for quite a while, and I'm sure the folks who run it are lovely people.

1939
04:08:29.500 --> 04:08:39.000
If you check out their website, you will see they are proud to tell us what curriculum they use.

1940
04:08:39.000 --> 04:08:44.500
It is a curriculum that advertises itself as a Christian curriculum.

1941
04:08:44.500 --> 04:08:47.000
It offers a religious education.

1942
04:08:47.000 --> 04:09:02.000
As I read the New Hampshire Constitution, it is not allowed for the town to use our money to fund a scholarship to pay the tuition to a Christian school.

1943
04:09:02.000 --> 04:09:18.500
The separation of church and state is one of the basic tenets of American democracy, as inviolable as part one, article 2A of the New Hampshire Constitution about the right to bear arms.

1944
04:09:18.500 --> 04:09:27.000
I hope you agree with me and look favorably on this bill, but I am not naive.

1945
04:09:27.000 --> 04:09:32.500
I hope you will think about what I have brought forward.

1946
04:09:32.500 --> 04:09:37.000
Think about it seriously and don't play word games.

1947
04:09:37.000 --> 04:09:39.000
Thank you.

1948
04:09:39.000 --> 04:09:41.000
Thank you very much.

1949
04:09:41.000 --> 04:09:44.000
Are there questions for Representative Porter?

1950
04:09:44.000 --> 04:09:46.000
Representative Cordelli.

1951
04:09:46.000 --> 04:09:48.000
Thank you, Mr.

1952
04:09:48.000 --> 04:09:50.000
Chairman.

1953
04:09:50.000 --> 04:09:52.000
Thank you, Representative.

1954
04:09:52.000 --> 04:09:58.000
We have had several bills directly and indirectly related to this topic.

1955
04:09:58.000 --> 04:10:12.000
And I'm wondering if you are familiar with the Espinoza Supreme Court decision, which basically invalidated Blaine amendments, and is wondering how you believe that impacts your legislation.

1956
04:10:12.000 --> 04:10:14.000
I am familiar.

1957
04:10:14.000 --> 04:10:17.500
I know about the Blaine amendments invalidation.

1958
04:10:17.500 --> 04:10:24.500
I don't quite understand why, but that does not invalidate our Bill of Rights.

1959
04:10:24.500 --> 04:10:27.500
It does not invalidate Article 6A.

1960
04:10:27.500 --> 04:10:29.500
Further questions?

1961
04:10:29.500 --> 04:10:31.500
Representative Likas?

1962
04:10:31.500 --> 04:10:59.500
My understanding in the finding is that if you have a program which is open to all schools but religious schools, like where the parents are choosing, particularly where the parents are choosing where the money goes, and they can choose everything but religious schools, that is religious discrimination, and that is why it's not allowed.

1963
04:10:59.500 --> 04:11:24.000
And that is why I find fault with a large part of the program that we put through this with a budget bill this year because it does not allow us to follow the New Hampshire constitution which says we cannot contribute our tax dollars to a religious school.

1964
04:11:24.000 --> 04:11:30.500
That's why I'm finding fault and that's why I brought forward this bill.

1965
04:11:30.500 --> 04:11:41.500
Recently there was a bill that we acted on that did use local taxes to pay for freedom accounts, local freedom accounts.

1966
04:11:41.500 --> 04:12:01.000
And I'm wondering how that's going to help the town of Hillsboro improve its science scores on the state test when the local Christian school uses a curriculum that says that dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time.

1967
04:12:01.000 --> 04:12:11.500
If my tax dollars are going to that kind of science education, and we're trying to raise our scores, it's self-defeating.

1968
04:12:11.500 --> 04:12:16.000
Thank you, and I'll talk to you one-on-one later.

1969
04:12:16.000 --> 04:12:18.000
Representative Boehm.

1970
04:12:18.000 --> 04:12:20.000
Thank you, Mr.

1971
04:12:20.000 --> 04:12:22.000
Chairman.

1972
04:12:22.000 --> 04:12:25.000
Thank you for taking the question.

1973
04:12:25.000 --> 04:12:36.500
Are you aware that the state law now also may require that you provide bus transportation to your religious school in your town?

1974
04:12:36.500 --> 04:12:59.500
I'm not aware of that, although I know when my son did go to the private school, it was on a bus line, so he was able to take a school bus to the school and home from the school because it wasn't any added costs.

1975
04:12:59.500 --> 04:13:04.500
I don't think that that's part of my issue here.

1976
04:13:04.500 --> 04:13:06.500
But it's taxes.

1977
04:13:06.500 --> 04:13:09.000
Further questions for Representative Tanner?

1978
04:13:09.000 --> 04:13:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

1979
04:13:11.000 --> 04:13:15.000
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

1980
04:13:15.000 --> 04:13:31.000
Do you realize that, or are you aware that there are still court cases being brought in Maine and several other states challenging this separation of public money going to religious education?

1981
04:13:31.000 --> 04:13:34.500
I am aware there are other cases.

1982
04:13:34.500 --> 04:13:44.500
And I think the fact that Article VI in Part I of our Constitution was put in there in 1784.

1983
04:13:44.500 --> 04:13:48.500
That was 100 years before the Blaine Amendment.

1984
04:13:48.500 --> 04:13:52.000
It's the basic tenets of our Constitution.

1985
04:13:52.000 --> 04:13:57.500
Our democracy is founded on this separation of church and state.

1986
04:13:57.500 --> 04:14:16.500
And as much as it would have helped my parents to get tax dollars to send me to the religious school, it's against our basic tenets to use public money to pay for religious education, in my opinion.

1987
04:14:16.500 --> 04:14:18.500
Yes, go ahead.

1988
04:14:18.500 --> 04:14:37.000
Does this particular bill speak to a bill that hasn't been passed yet but currently proposed that would take at this point we're taking state public funds or people's business and tax write-offs to fund our EFAs.

1989
04:14:37.000 --> 04:15:20.500
But does this bill speak to a recent bill that was introduced that actually took the per-pupil cost that a local community, like you and your husband paying your property tax, that portion that goes to the school taxes, take out of that and actually take what it would cost, what you're giving to fund the school, the athletic programs, you water, the sewer, everything to that school building as well as the student that's over and above what the state pays to the education scholarship accounts?

1990
04:15:20.500 --> 04:15:24.000
Yes, I am aware of that bill.

1991
04:15:24.000 --> 04:15:27.000
It is a concern to me.

1992
04:15:27.000 --> 04:15:38.000
As I mentioned when we were addressing another bill when we were in Rep's Hall, my school struggles to meet its budget.

1993
04:15:38.000 --> 04:15:43.000
We have been living on default budgets for years now.

1994
04:15:43.000 --> 04:15:48.000
Our taxpayers are overburdened to pay for what we have.

1995
04:15:48.000 --> 04:16:19.500
And if those tax dollars are being used to fund separate other school systems more than what the town provides we're just going to be wiped out and I really concerned that it's going to cause deep cuts in our and our bill our ability to fund the basics that we are giving our students now again I, I get emotional about this.

1996
04:16:19.500 --> 04:16:28.500
I can't believe that we are actually allowing religious schools to be paid for with our public funds.

1997
04:16:28.500 --> 04:16:40.000
That goes so against all I've ever known about our democracy that I have a hard time even getting my mind around it.

1998
04:16:40.000 --> 04:16:43.500
And that's why I filed this bill.

1999
04:16:43.500 --> 04:16:45.500
Representative Luna.

2000
04:16:45.500 --> 04:16:48.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

2001
04:16:48.000 --> 04:16:54.000
Chair, and thank you very much, Representative Porter, for bringing this forward.

2002
04:16:54.000 --> 04:17:06.000
Do you feel that the state of New Hampshire could do a better job at directing state resources towards the Hillsborough Deering School District?

2003
04:17:06.000 --> 04:17:08.000
Of course they could.

2004
04:17:08.000 --> 04:17:31.500
I was looking at those Delaware numbers, and I was looking at the smaller size of Delaware and the huge difference in what the state is contributing toward the career and technical institutes in that state, and it was just eye-opening to me to see the difference.

2005
04:17:31.500 --> 04:17:38.000
What we could do with that money in our school is just amazing.

2006
04:17:38.000 --> 04:17:40.500
We have very dedicated teachers.

2007
04:17:40.500 --> 04:17:44.000
We have a difficult population to educate.

2008
04:17:44.000 --> 04:17:52.500
We need every penny that we have in order to do it as well as we can.

2009
04:17:52.500 --> 04:17:54.500
And a follow-up?

2010
04:17:54.500 --> 04:17:56.500
Yes.

2011
04:17:56.500 --> 04:17:58.500
Thank you, Mr.

2012
04:17:58.500 --> 04:18:02.000
Chair, and thanks for taking my question.

2013
04:18:02.000 --> 04:18:07.500
Do you believe, well, it's not a do you believe question.

2014
04:18:07.500 --> 04:18:30.000
How would you describe the Hillsborough – the resources that the Hillsborough Deering School District has access to in order to fulfill their obligation to provide an adequate – constitutionally adequate education to their students compared to, let's say, other school districts around the state.

2015
04:18:30.000 --> 04:18:32.500
I'm proud of our school.

2016
04:18:32.500 --> 04:18:38.000
We have a lot of good things that go on there.

2017
04:18:38.000 --> 04:18:40.500
We have excellent arts programs.

2018
04:18:40.500 --> 04:18:51.500
Many of our students have gone off to be music teachers and art teachers and artists and very successful in those areas.

2019
04:18:51.500 --> 04:19:00.000
Many of our students, like my daughter, went off to get doctoral degrees from Ivy League schools.

2020
04:19:00.000 --> 04:19:06.000
So I'm very proud of what we do with what we have.

2021
04:19:06.000 --> 04:19:23.000
But there are certainly a lot of programs and opportunities that our kids don't have that maybe the kids in Bow or Amherst or Hollis or some of those other wealthier districts do have.

2022
04:19:23.000 --> 04:19:29.500
And we do the best we can, but we certainly could use more.

2023
04:19:29.500 --> 04:19:32.500
I have a question for you.

2024
04:19:32.500 --> 04:19:45.000
Are you aware that during the last session, the statewide property taxes that you are asked to raise as a local was reduced by one-third?

2025
04:19:45.000 --> 04:19:55.000
I am aware that $100 million of education property tax, swept tax, was returned to the voters in the state.

2026
04:19:55.000 --> 04:20:03.500
And that $100 million is being taken from the Education Trust Fund to make up the difference.

2027
04:20:03.500 --> 04:20:05.500
Representative Likas.

2028
04:20:05.500 --> 04:20:17.500
Are you aware that that other bill we were talking about is enabling legislation and your town would have to vote to do that?

2029
04:20:17.500 --> 04:20:22.000
And it really wasn't designed for towns like yours.

2030
04:20:22.000 --> 04:20:36.000
It was more designed for towns who maybe just have elementary and decide that, or maybe it's too far for whatever school, for half the town or whatever.

2031
04:20:36.000 --> 04:20:42.000
It's for the town to decide this is what's best for us.

2032
04:20:42.000 --> 04:20:49.000
And I know my town, I don't expect them to ever vote for that.

2033
04:20:49.000 --> 04:20:52.000
And yours may be the same.

2034
04:20:52.000 --> 04:21:15.500
Perhaps you're not aware that in that same bill, if a town does make the decision to try it out and then decides it's not working, they are still liable to pay the same amount of money to each student that was originally enrolled in the program.

2035
04:21:15.500 --> 04:21:51.000
So if my town decides, yes, let's give this a try in 2010, excuse me, 2025, and they find out it's not working but 15 students have enrolled and we get rid of it in 2016 we need to keep paying those 16 students until they graduate from high school were you aware of that in that bill yes thank you are there further questions of the representative Representative Cord was.

2036
04:21:51.000 --> 04:21:53.000
Thank you.

2037
04:21:53.000 --> 04:21:56.500
Are there further questions of the representative?

2038
04:21:56.500 --> 04:21:58.500
Representative Cordelli?

2039
04:21:58.500 --> 04:22:00.500
Thank you.

2040
04:22:00.500 --> 04:22:14.500
I would just point out that the $100 million tax cut from the swept funds was made whole, so there was no loss to the education trust fund.

2041
04:22:14.500 --> 04:23:05.000
but my question is in relation to another one of our statutes that maybe you're not aware of is RSA 189 colon 49 child benefit services which allows a district to vote to send money to non-public schools for benefit services such as health services, textbooks, instructional materials, health services and that at least one town in this state votes every year to send approximately $40,000 to the local Catholic school in recognition that those children need some services, and they would be paying a lot more in taxes if those children attended the public school rather than the Catholic school.

2042
04:23:05.000 --> 04:23:08.000
Are you aware of that, Stacie?

2043
04:23:08.000 --> 04:23:11.000
Yes, I am aware of that.

2044
04:23:11.000 --> 04:23:13.000
Great.

2045
04:23:13.000 --> 04:23:15.000
Thank you.

2046
04:23:15.000 --> 04:23:30.000
And I'm also aware that in the $100 million of swept money, I also know that there are communities who collect more swept money than they need and keep it.

2047
04:23:30.000 --> 04:23:38.500
And I know that when the $100 million was approved, the cut, those towns were made whole.

2048
04:23:38.500 --> 04:23:41.500
So they would not be losing.

2049
04:23:41.500 --> 04:23:57.000
When that tax rate goes down, those wealthiest towns that get to keep the extra swept are still going to keep the same amount of swept money that they did before.

2050
04:23:57.000 --> 04:24:07.500
So again, it's a chance for the wealthiest, richest towns to get more money as opposed to the rest of us.

2051
04:24:07.500 --> 04:24:10.000
Okay, are there further questions?

2052
04:24:10.000 --> 04:24:12.000
Not seeing any.

2053
04:24:12.000 --> 04:24:14.000
Thank you very much.

2054
04:24:14.000 --> 04:24:16.000
Thank you, Mr.

2055
04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:18.000
Chair.

2056
04:24:18.000 --> 04:24:23.000
Do we have any other cards on this particular bill?

2057
04:24:23.000 --> 04:24:25.000
Pardon me?

2058
04:24:25.000 --> 04:24:27.000
No?

2059
04:24:27.000 --> 04:24:35.000
So with that, we have no other cards, so I will call this hearing to close.

2060
04:24:35.000 --> 04:24:39.500
Okay, we will start the next one at 3.30.

2061
04:24:39.500 --> 04:24:41.500
Thank you for that.

2062
04:24:41.500 --> 04:24:43.500
Thank you.

2063
04:24:43.500 --> 04:24:45.500
Thank you.

2064
04:24:45.500 --> 04:24:47.500
Thank you.

2065
04:24:47.500 --> 04:24:49.500
Thank you.

2066
04:24:49.500 --> 04:24:51.500
Thank you.

2067
04:24:51.500 --> 04:24:53.500
Thank you.

2068
04:24:53.500 --> 04:24:55.500
Thank you.

2069
04:24:55.500 --> 04:24:57.500
Thank you.

2070
04:24:57.500 --> 04:24:59.500
Thank you.

2071
04:24:59.500 --> 04:25:01.500
Thank you.

2072
04:25:01.500 --> 04:25:03.500
Thank you.

2073
04:25:03.500 --> 04:25:05.500
Thank you.

2074
04:25:05.500 --> 04:25:07.500
Thank you.

2075
04:25:07.500 --> 04:25:09.500
Thank you.

2076
04:25:09.500 --> 04:25:11.500
Thank you.

2077
04:25:11.500 --> 04:25:13.500
Thank you.

2078
04:25:13.500 --> 04:25:15.500
Thank you.

2079
04:25:15.500 --> 04:25:17.500
Thank you.

2080
04:25:17.500 --> 04:25:19.500
Thank you.

2081
04:25:19.500 --> 04:25:21.500
Thank you.

2082
04:25:21.500 --> 04:25:23.500
Thank you.

2083
04:25:23.500 --> 04:25:25.500
Thank you.

2084
04:25:25.500 --> 04:25:27.500
Thank you.

2085
04:25:27.500 --> 04:25:29.500
Thank you.

2086
04:25:29.500 --> 04:25:32.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

2087
04:25:32.000 --> 04:25:34.000
Chair.

2088
04:25:34.000 --> 04:25:38.000
House Education, thank you for hearing me today.

2089
04:25:38.000 --> 04:25:47.000
For the record, my name is Sue Mullen, and I represent Hillsborough District 7, the town of Bedford.

2090
04:25:47.000 --> 04:26:03.500
Today I am introducing House Bill 1114, Representative Cornell's bill that establishes the requirement for scholarship organizations that manage education savings accounts to develop a directory of public profiles for education service providers.

2091
04:26:03.500 --> 04:26:33.500
This bill would require the scholarship organization to ensure that the education service provider directory that is on their website includes information about each provider to help families and students make the best decisions for themselves according to a recent federal government accountability office report nearly all voucher and ESA programs in the country include a directory of participating providers.

2092
04:26:33.500 --> 04:26:53.000
But a lack of central location for critical information, like accreditation status, services available for students with disabilities, school performance data, means that oftentimes families don't have the information they need to make informed decisions on their children's education.

2093
04:26:53.000 --> 04:27:03.000
In the report, multiple families describe challenges in getting information about whether a particular school could meet their child's needs.

2094
04:27:03.000 --> 04:27:17.000
Parents described attempts to enroll their student with disabilities in multiple schools before finding one that would admit their child I'm going to go ahead and get it.

2095
04:27:17.000 --> 04:27:19.000
their child's needs.

2096
04:27:19.000 --> 04:27:33.500
Parents described attempts to enroll their student with disabilities in multiple schools before finding one that would admit their child or that was the right fit for their child.

2097
04:27:33.500 --> 04:27:42.000
Several parents described the process of finding the right school for their children as trial and error.

2098
04:27:42.000 --> 04:27:51.000
Lack of information can result in parents discovering key information about a school only after enrolling the child.

2099
04:27:51.000 --> 04:28:13.000
For example, a family who has a student currently enrolled in a private school choice program said they wish that they had known that they would be charged for some of the special education services that that private school was providing to their child.

2100
04:28:13.000 --> 04:28:37.500
One family said they were surprised to learn that teachers providing education services to their child were not trained to provide those services, and another parent described changing schools because they learned aspects of their child's disability couldn't be accommodated only after their child was enrolled in the school.

2101
04:28:37.500 --> 04:29:04.500
A central repository of information on all participating providers would mean that families could have the information in one place enabling them to make the best educated decisions possible for the sake of families who are participating in the program i sincerely hope that our committee will find house bill 114 ought to pass.

2102
04:29:04.500 --> 04:29:06.500
Thank you.

2103
04:29:06.500 --> 04:29:08.500
Very much, Representative Mullen.

2104
04:29:08.500 --> 04:29:12.000
Are there any questions of the representative?

2105
04:29:12.000 --> 04:29:14.000
Yes, Representative Lakers.

2106
04:29:14.000 --> 04:29:16.000
Thank you.

2107
04:29:16.000 --> 04:29:22.000
Are you aware that some of these service providers only provide materials?

2108
04:29:22.000 --> 04:29:52.000
I mean, I love the idea of having some kind of, and I think we had talked about that as the thing was being set up, having that so parents could do that, but the way you've written it, it says every, you know, for each education service provider, and the service, the way, hang on, I'll get you the.

2109
04:29:52.000 --> 04:30:05.500
The definition of education service provider means a person or organization that receives payments from education freedom accounts to provide educational goods and services to EFA students.

2110
04:30:05.500 --> 04:30:09.500
So there are ones who just provide goods.

2111
04:30:09.500 --> 04:30:17.000
And so all of these things that you're saying they must provide doesn't even apply.

2112
04:30:17.000 --> 04:30:22.000
Yeah, I don't think that there would be a problem.

2113
04:30:22.000 --> 04:30:41.000
In my own mind, in talking with Representative Cornell, I'm a co-sponsor on this bill, I see a template being developed and then there being an option for not applicable to any section that doesn't fit the bill.

2114
04:30:41.000 --> 04:30:43.000
Sorry.

2115
04:30:43.000 --> 04:30:55.000
Or even if you are a provider having a place for parents to say, hey, this is a really inexpensive place to get whatever.

2116
04:30:55.000 --> 04:30:57.000
Right.

2117
04:30:57.000 --> 04:31:01.000
You know, whatever comments parents want to leave.

2118
04:31:01.000 --> 04:31:07.500
I just didn't want to see it try to go forward like this.

2119
04:31:07.500 --> 04:31:30.000
Yeah, no, I believe that that's why the but is not limited to is in the bill for the list, so that if the scholarship organization gets the request and there's a category not on the form, then they could add that to the form.

2120
04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:54.000
Right, but you wouldn't be able to have every service provider provide all of this information no no that's right but the name contact information the types of materials that they provide right yeah thank you you're welcome further questions perhaps mo and I have one for you.

2121
04:31:54.000 --> 04:31:56.000
Yes, sir.

2122
04:31:56.000 --> 04:32:04.000
Within the list of items here that the provider should provide, there's one called accreditation status.

2123
04:32:04.000 --> 04:32:09.000
Is there a purpose for limiting it to accreditation status?

2124
04:32:09.000 --> 04:32:13.500
We don't expect that from our public schools either.

2125
04:32:13.500 --> 04:32:20.000
There's also a narrative report that can be handed in in its stead.

2126
04:32:20.000 --> 04:32:22.000
Right.

2127
04:32:22.000 --> 04:32:26.000
No, I don't think it would be limited.

2128
04:32:26.000 --> 04:32:39.000
If it made more sense to have a drop-down box where you could put a narrative in, then I think that it can be explained easily.

2129
04:32:39.000 --> 04:32:56.500
Just so I explain, the narrative is an input-based, and there are certain issues or elements which are required within that, which should complement, if you're accredited, you don't have to do that narrative input.

2130
04:32:56.500 --> 04:32:58.500
Right, right.

2131
04:32:58.500 --> 04:33:16.000
And that certainly, you know, I would expect that this would go through rules like anything else and that the scholarship organization would have its own ideas about how to tailor this to the clientele.

2132
04:33:16.000 --> 04:33:18.000
Thank you.

2133
04:33:18.000 --> 04:33:20.000
Yes, Representative Moffitt.

2134
04:33:20.000 --> 04:33:22.000
Thank you, Mr.

2135
04:33:22.000 --> 04:33:24.000
Chair.

2136
04:33:24.000 --> 04:33:27.500
Thank you, Representative, for taking my question.

2137
04:33:27.500 --> 04:33:35.000
I'm looking at this, and I see a lot of utility and value to this.

2138
04:33:35.000 --> 04:33:47.500
I'm wondering about if something like this were to move forward, maybe including sports or extracurricular activities, would there be a place for that, perhaps?

2139
04:33:47.500 --> 04:34:11.000
Yep, at the top one it says, but is not limited to, right before letter A, then yes, most definitely, I think, that if there were extracurricular activities, whether it be a theater program or sports or whatever, that a service provider would want to include that.

2140
04:34:11.000 --> 04:34:13.000
Thank you.

2141
04:34:13.000 --> 04:34:15.000
Thank you.

2142
04:34:15.000 --> 04:34:17.000
Representative Likas?

2143
04:34:17.000 --> 04:34:58.500
Yes, the other thing, thank you, that I had thought about was that some of the service providers are actually homeschool families who are selling their books, used books, to another family, and they have to be treated as a service provider, but they're not necessarily going to want their public information put out there as their phone number and that kind of stuff because they're just one family who says, yes, I have used school books, and another family is buying them.

2144
04:34:58.500 --> 04:35:04.500
So we have to be kind of sensitive to that as well.

2145
04:35:04.500 --> 04:35:06.500
Certainly.

2146
04:35:06.500 --> 04:35:08.500
Okay.

2147
04:35:08.500 --> 04:35:10.500
Thank you.

2148
04:35:10.500 --> 04:35:57.500
Representative Mullen, do you know if the scholarship organization is presently doing something such as this I do not I it could very well be something that was recently undertaken but because the program is so new we just sort of jumped on it and thought okay well let's look and see when other people were starting their programs what were the kinds of things that they felt they could improve upon and this was leading the list thank you are there any other questions for the representative not seen yeah yes Representative Cardelli?

2149
04:35:57.500 --> 04:36:00.000
Sorry for the late hand.

2150
04:36:00.000 --> 04:36:02.000
Thank you, Representative.

2151
04:36:02.000 --> 04:36:19.500
I'm just wondering, rather than the scholarship organization compiling a large directory, and I guess making it would have to be on their website, or I don't know if it could be a paper document.

2152
04:36:19.500 --> 04:36:49.500
It's not really specified, but wouldn't you think that a parent looking for an education option would possibly be already looking at options in the area that they live and have an idea of a service provider, whether it be a school or a theater company, as you mentioned before, and do their own investigation and talking to other parents.

2153
04:36:49.500 --> 04:38:08.000
There are all sorts of websites even for schools these days, niche.com, greatschools.com, and so forth, that have a lot of information information available don't you think a parent would be investigating on their own I would expect that a parent would be investigating on their own let me let me just restate again that this information came from the government accountability office which is the federal version sort of of our LBA if you will and that the info the quotes that I read for you came directly from their reports so this is a GAO report on scholarship on voucher programs so I I don't have a way to answer that question they collected the data and listed this as an area of weakness so I would assume this is representative Cornell I know that she took the the listed categories right from that report so they were just just trying to list helpful information.

2154
04:38:08.000 --> 04:38:10.000
Follow-up?

2155
04:38:10.000 --> 04:38:12.000
Thank you.

2156
04:38:12.000 --> 04:38:21.000
Would it be possible to get a copy of that GAO report or point us to the site?

2157
04:38:21.000 --> 04:38:26.500
If you look under Government Accountability Office, GAO, you'll find it.

2158
04:38:26.500 --> 04:38:29.500
I don't have the report myself.

2159
04:38:29.500 --> 04:38:41.000
I'm sure that Representative Cornell would be willing to look around for you, Representative, and see if she could get a paper copy.

2160
04:38:41.000 --> 04:38:45.500
But the Government Accountability Office has a full website.

2161
04:38:45.500 --> 04:38:47.500
Thank you.

2162
04:38:47.500 --> 04:38:49.500
Are there further?

2163
04:38:49.500 --> 04:38:51.500
Yes, Representative Lakers.

2164
04:38:51.500 --> 04:39:03.000
I'm wondering if you think it would be okay to – they already have to list all of the providers, which they do.

2165
04:39:03.000 --> 04:39:06.000
In fact, I just accessed it.

2166
04:39:06.000 --> 04:39:19.000
But rather than they all have to include these things, somehow making it so that they may include these things, just for reasons, like I said.

2167
04:39:19.000 --> 04:39:28.500
Some of them don't apply, and some of them are like a private family who is just selling textbooks.

2168
04:39:28.500 --> 04:39:30.500
Right, right.

2169
04:39:30.500 --> 04:39:53.500
And so is there some way to, you know, the idea of having information that, in particular, or have it open so that parents can make comments, you know, sort of like ratings or whatever would be great, but that's still do it as a may.

2170
04:39:53.500 --> 04:40:04.000
Representative, if you want to look at an amendment to this, I would be delighted to look at it with you.

2171
04:40:04.000 --> 04:40:06.000
Thank you very much.

2172
04:40:06.000 --> 04:40:08.000
You're quite welcome.

2173
04:40:08.000 --> 04:40:13.000
Representative Mullen, I have a further question on that list.

2174
04:40:13.000 --> 04:40:25.000
Recently we've heard from parents that they're trying to access and become familiar with the curriculum offered within a public school or school district.

2175
04:40:25.000 --> 04:40:27.000
Yes.

2176
04:40:27.000 --> 04:40:58.000
We're asking that in terms of the scholarship organization that they list and identify curriculum and teaching philosophy are all our public schools doing that well I think that's what we're trying to get them to do isn't it okay thank you thank you very much thank you are there further questions from the committee not seeing any thank you very much.

2177
04:40:58.000 --> 04:41:00.000
Thank you.

2178
04:41:00.000 --> 04:41:03.500
Are there further questions from the committee?

2179
04:41:03.500 --> 04:41:05.500
Not seeing any.

2180
04:41:05.500 --> 04:41:07.500
Thank you very much.

2181
04:41:07.500 --> 04:41:09.500
You're quite welcome.

2182
04:41:09.500 --> 04:41:11.500
Happy Friday afternoon.

2183
04:41:11.500 --> 04:41:13.500
You too.

2184
04:41:13.500 --> 04:41:20.500
We are not done yet, folks, because we have one more pink card here.

2185
04:41:20.500 --> 04:41:24.000
Matt Southerton from the Charter School Foundation.

2186
04:41:24.000 --> 04:41:29.500
Well, you are a charter school, so yeah, the foundation, yeah.

2187
04:41:29.500 --> 04:41:33.000
Technical support is what you've written down.

2188
04:41:33.000 --> 04:41:38.000
Thank you, Matt Southerton again from the Children's Scholarship Fund.

2189
04:41:38.000 --> 04:41:42.500
We just have a couple issues with this bill.

2190
04:41:42.500 --> 04:41:49.000
As a sort of data policy guy, compliance guy, I love more data.

2191
04:41:49.000 --> 04:41:56.500
I love collecting more so that we can see how we can prove the program.

2192
04:41:56.500 --> 04:42:23.500
One issue with this is that the amount and the types of data that you're proposing on collecting, I don't believe that even the Department of Education collects this data, and I don't believe that we actually have the legal authority to collect some of this data, so we would need guidance from you.

2193
04:42:23.500 --> 04:42:31.000
So, for example, school performance data, including test scores, retention rates, graduation rates, if applicable.

2194
04:42:31.000 --> 04:42:37.500
I don't believe that the Department of Education collects that from private schools.

2195
04:42:37.500 --> 04:42:44.500
So I don't know what would give us the legal authority to do that.

2196
04:42:44.500 --> 04:42:57.000
Now, in the EFA law, you do require us to collect aggregated data for the students that participate in the program on their test scores.

2197
04:42:57.000 --> 04:43:00.500
And that is one of three ways.

2198
04:43:00.500 --> 04:43:09.500
They can use nationally standardized test scores, the statewide assessment, or a reviewed portfolio by a certified teacher.

2199
04:43:09.500 --> 04:43:18.000
So that's one way to get at the information that you're looking for that we already do.

2200
04:43:18.000 --> 04:43:29.500
And they have to submit that once a year, or we can't give them the next disbursement of their funds to the account.

2201
04:43:29.500 --> 04:43:32.500
Another issue was the accreditation status.

2202
04:43:32.500 --> 04:43:36.500
I don't know how we would address that.

2203
04:43:36.500 --> 04:43:42.000
Curriculum and teaching philosophy, I think you brought that one up.

2204
04:43:42.000 --> 04:43:44.000
Also, total enrollment.

2205
04:43:44.000 --> 04:43:53.000
I don't know what would we do if a private school just refused to give us the data.

2206
04:43:53.000 --> 04:43:57.500
What legal authority would we have to request that?

2207
04:43:57.500 --> 04:44:02.000
So I'm perfectly willing to work with you all.

2208
04:44:02.000 --> 04:44:05.000
I think more information is good.

2209
04:44:05.000 --> 04:44:08.000
More information is good for parents.

2210
04:44:08.000 --> 04:44:20.500
I think that perhaps we can sort of narrow the focus and see what makes sense and see what's the best way to implement that.

2211
04:44:20.500 --> 04:44:23.500
But I'm open to any questions.

2212
04:44:23.500 --> 04:44:25.500
Are there any questions?

2213
04:44:25.500 --> 04:44:27.500
Yes.

2214
04:44:27.500 --> 04:44:30.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

2215
04:44:30.000 --> 04:44:32.000
Sharon.

2216
04:44:32.000 --> 04:44:39.000
Thank you for taking my question and hanging with us on a Friday afternoon.

2217
04:44:39.000 --> 04:44:43.500
Does your scholarship organization contract with these third-party ESPs?

2218
04:44:43.500 --> 04:44:45.500
With the who?

2219
04:44:45.500 --> 04:44:47.500
The education service providers.

2220
04:44:47.500 --> 04:44:51.000
That's how you refer to them, right?

2221
04:44:51.000 --> 04:44:55.000
Yeah, we do not contract with them, no.

2222
04:44:55.000 --> 04:44:57.500
They're not – follow up?

2223
04:44:57.500 --> 04:44:59.500
Not to my knowledge.

2224
04:44:59.500 --> 04:45:01.500
Yes.

2225
04:45:01.500 --> 04:45:08.000
Are they subject to any sort of scrutiny or approval by your organization?

2226
04:45:08.000 --> 04:45:10.000
Yes, absolutely.

2227
04:45:10.000 --> 04:45:12.500
Everyone has to be vetted.

2228
04:45:12.500 --> 04:45:16.000
They go through a whole approval process.

2229
04:45:16.000 --> 04:45:19.000
Every education service provider is vetted.

2230
04:45:19.000 --> 04:45:24.500
So take example, a private school, a New Hampshire private school.

2231
04:45:24.500 --> 04:45:37.500
A New Hampshire private school can only participate in the program if they are New Hampshire Department of Education certified, if they are registered with them.

2232
04:45:37.500 --> 04:45:39.500
Amazon.

2233
04:45:39.500 --> 04:45:43.500
Amazon has to go through the approval process.

2234
04:45:43.500 --> 04:45:48.000
We make sure that Amazon is an accredited business.

2235
04:45:48.000 --> 04:45:56.500
We check the Better Business Bureau, make sure that they don't have complaints against them for that.

2236
04:45:56.500 --> 04:46:00.500
Sole proprietors are a little bit more difficult.

2237
04:46:00.500 --> 04:46:24.000
What we do is we take those steps that I mentioned before, but in addition to that, we also go through the process of going through the national sexual abuse check and other procedures like that so that we can thoroughly vet them as much as possible.

2238
04:46:24.000 --> 04:46:26.500
And a follow-up on that?

2239
04:46:26.500 --> 04:46:28.500
Yes.

2240
04:46:28.500 --> 04:46:45.000
And I know I'm pressing everybody's patience here, but through that thorough vetting process, then, it's very clear that none of these service providers have an absolute right to do business with you.

2241
04:46:45.000 --> 04:46:50.000
That's up to your organization as to whether or not.

2242
04:46:50.000 --> 04:46:55.500
I would have to have the CFO discuss that with you.

2243
04:46:55.500 --> 04:46:58.000
You do business with that.

2244
04:46:58.000 --> 04:47:01.000
I'm going to defer to her.

2245
04:47:01.000 --> 04:47:03.000
Is she here?

2246
04:47:03.000 --> 04:47:05.000
She is not.

2247
04:47:05.000 --> 04:47:10.000
I could definitely put you in contact with those folks.

2248
04:47:10.000 --> 04:47:28.500
Then I guess what I'd like to ask you then is whether it would be possible as part of your vetting process and any other formal process that you have in place with your education service providers.

2249
04:47:28.500 --> 04:47:35.500
Obviously, you must be somehow transferring funds from a scholarship account to their account.

2250
04:47:35.500 --> 04:47:46.000
So there must be something on file, some formal confidential account number or something that you have to get from them.

2251
04:47:46.000 --> 04:47:53.000
Yeah, and I can definitely have them come in and discuss that with you.

2252
04:47:53.000 --> 04:48:27.500
So I guess the question is, could, as part of this very detailed, rigorous vetting process and even as minimal as the contract may be to include a remittance account number, that that could the answers to these A through J elements here also be part of that vetting and collection of data from the education service providers who are applying to be considered as part of your program.

2253
04:48:27.500 --> 04:48:29.500
That is a possibility.

2254
04:48:29.500 --> 04:48:37.500
I mean, I would have to get someone in here to talk about that with you.

2255
04:48:37.500 --> 04:48:40.500
To include that in the application.

2256
04:48:40.500 --> 04:48:45.500
That's what gives you the ability to ask for that.

2257
04:48:45.500 --> 04:48:53.000
They can say no, but also they're saying no to being part of your program.

2258
04:48:53.000 --> 04:48:55.000
Thank you.

2259
04:48:55.000 --> 04:48:57.000
Are there further questions?

2260
04:48:57.000 --> 04:48:59.000
Representative Porter?

2261
04:48:59.000 --> 04:49:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

2262
04:49:01.000 --> 04:49:03.000
Chair.

2263
04:49:03.000 --> 04:49:44.000
As a parent of a child, and I'm looking for the best opportunity for my child, I think I would want to know if a service provider refused to give me some of the information that's included on this list, how many kids graduated, what their accreditation standards are, and that sort of thing, I certainly would hope that it would be noted then if the provider refused to give that information that it would say in the directory, provider refused information.

2264
04:49:44.000 --> 04:49:48.000
I mean, I think it's important, these things.

2265
04:49:48.000 --> 04:49:51.000
Parents thought these things were important.

2266
04:49:51.000 --> 04:49:57.000
It certainly seems like we ought to be providing it for them.

2267
04:49:57.000 --> 04:50:11.500
Yeah, we definitely have a process in place for reporting a provider if they have a complaint and for denying a provider eligibility to be part of the program.

2268
04:50:11.500 --> 04:50:21.500
And then they can appeal to the Board of Education if they feel that we basically kicked them out wrongly.

2269
04:50:21.500 --> 04:50:50.500
But if a parent had a child with special needs and they didn't find out until the child was already enrolled in the school that the school did not have a program to meet their child's needs, then that's a concern, because then the child is disrupted, has to go to another school, and that sort of thing.

2270
04:50:50.500 --> 04:51:00.000
I would think we would want to make sure that parents have that information before they enroll their child.

2271
04:51:00.000 --> 04:51:09.000
So I'm hoping that you can figure out a way to get this directory out there for parents.

2272
04:51:09.000 --> 04:51:13.000
Representative Cordelli, do you have a final question?

2273
04:51:13.000 --> 04:51:15.000
Yes.

2274
04:51:15.000 --> 04:51:17.000
Yes.

2275
04:51:17.000 --> 04:51:45.000
With a child, excuse me, parent with a child with special needs, wouldn't you think that the parent would be talking to a prospective school in order to discuss their child's needs and the school's ability to provide those services in line with what's required in IDA for a parentally placed child in a private school?

2276
04:51:45.000 --> 04:51:52.500
Well, yeah, I mean not not that having that information is necessarily a bad thing.

2277
04:51:52.500 --> 04:52:08.000
But obviously, if I was a parent with a child with special needs, I would be doing my due diligence to see if that was the right placement for them, right?

2278
04:52:08.000 --> 04:52:14.000
And we do have parents with special needs students, and they're amazing.

2279
04:52:14.000 --> 04:52:25.000
They call me up, and they email me, and they ask us for help, and we help them, and we love it.

2280
04:52:25.000 --> 04:52:36.000
So yeah yeah, I mean, those parents are very active with their students, and I think they do their due diligence themselves.

2281
04:52:36.000 --> 04:52:41.500
But, again, having that information is not necessarily a bad thing.

2282
04:52:41.500 --> 04:52:43.500
Thank you.

2283
04:52:43.500 --> 04:52:45.500
Representative Tanner?

2284
04:52:45.500 --> 04:52:47.500
Thank you.

2285
04:52:47.500 --> 04:53:14.500
With as busy a schedule as people have and as chaotic as the pandemic has been, don't you think it would be a real, not nice is the word that came to mind, but I would like to have something a little bit better than that, make their lives easier, make parents' lives easier.

2286
04:53:14.500 --> 04:53:27.500
If there was a central place for them to go and just compare, look at this cursory to compare, because when I, for example, Thank you.

2287
04:53:27.500 --> 04:53:37.000
if there was a central place for them to go and just compare, look at this cursory to compare.

2288
04:53:37.000 --> 04:53:57.500
Because when I, for example, if I wanted to look for a school for my child and I could go down a list like this, say, oh, these three schools look like a good fit, and then go to their websites.

2289
04:53:57.500 --> 04:54:12.500
And a lot of their websites, private schools, have nice campus views and philosophy and their extracurricular sports and that sort of thing so that I narrow my search down.

2290
04:54:12.500 --> 04:54:20.500
Now, certainly in some areas of the state, you don't have a whole lot of options.

2291
04:54:20.500 --> 04:54:26.000
And so it may not be as beneficial to those people.

2292
04:54:26.000 --> 04:54:39.500
But certainly, you know, if you're in the southern part of the state or out on the seacoast area, you know, you have quite a few options.

2293
04:54:39.500 --> 04:54:51.500
And I just, do you think, don't you think that this would make it easier for parents and be something that they would welcome?

2294
04:54:51.500 --> 04:54:56.000
Well, I mean, I think this is all theoretical.

2295
04:54:56.000 --> 04:54:59.000
Again, I want to help parents.

2296
04:54:59.000 --> 04:55:03.000
I think we all want to help parents.

2297
04:55:03.000 --> 04:55:13.500
Whether they would actually use this data and whether, you know, they would put it to use, we just don't know.

2298
04:55:13.500 --> 04:55:24.000
And it might be something that we want to explore and say what would be the most beneficial data to parents.

2299
04:55:24.000 --> 04:56:39.500
What would we get the most bang for the bunk and we maybe want to want to bring some parents in and have a study committee on it and ask parents what are the things that you would like to know the most what would help you the most and bring them into this process ask them thank you are there any further questions not seeing any thank you very much and without any seeing any other pink cards this hearing is closed as a reminder for committee members uh next monday we have two subcommittee work sessions scheduled uh one at ten and one at one o'clock and then on the following Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday we have more activity we are not here the next Friday if you would like me to schedule something on that Friday I will okay thank you very much and everybody have a good weekend.

2300
04:56:39.500 --> 04:56:41.500
Thank you.

2301
04:56:41.500 --> 04:56:43.500
Thank you.
