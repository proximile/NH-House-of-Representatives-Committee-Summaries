00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
is no I have I have one I just uh was
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
rushing out this morning um so first up
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
LBA take it away good morning cret from
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistance office
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today just to kind of give
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
you an overview of what the committee's
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
charge is as it relates to um estimating
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted funds for the general
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
fund fishing game fund and Highway fund
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
and the general fund would include the
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so before you I
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
handed out a packet looks like this I'm
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
not going to speak to the entire thing
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to try to be up here for
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
as little time as possible so that I can
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
bring Lindsay and her team up so they
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
can talk you about the more fun and
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
exciting things um so as you understand
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
um you're here to do some Revenue
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
estimates um you're only doing the
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue estimate it's not
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
for the entire budget it's only those
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
things that haven't been assigned for a
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
particular function within the budget um
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
so like for fishing game you're you're
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
only doing about $13 million of Revenue
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
estimates when they spend much more than
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
that because they have several dedicated
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
revenue streams which the finance
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee will work with and make sure
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that the budget is balanced our staff if
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
you turn to just inside the front page
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
is a listing of our staff from our
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
office our offices consist of seven
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
individuals there's the LBA U myself the
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
deputy LBA
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
and then we have four budget analysts
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
and our support person and what we do
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
for you is all the fiscal notes on the
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
bills so we review all the lsrs that
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
come out so so far this year we've
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
looked at over 12200 lsrs or redrafts to
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
see if they need a fiscal note and then
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
we if they do we try to put something on
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
there um right now we've got around 400
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
bills that we've assigned a fiscal note
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
too in addition to that um our staff is
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
also responsible for doing fiscal impact
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
statements on the rules
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
and we do just over 300 of those a
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
year our primary charge though is to
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
assist the the legislative body with the
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
development of the operating budget the
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
capital budget um and that's what we
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
will mainly do this session so um I'm
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
here for you the rest of the staff is at
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
the finance committee um helping them
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
get through that process so I'm going to
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
walk you through what you're going to do
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
here and how it ties back into the
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
budget process again stay at a high
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
level um and just kind of ask questions
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
as they pop up for you so you've started
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
to hear from um the economic briefings
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
last week you're going to hear from
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
agencies this week in the next couple of
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
weeks where they'll come in with their
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
estimates on the revenues that they
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
generate or collect for the state um
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
that go into the unrestricted pots um as
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
we do that I start to put together if
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
you turn to page four of the document um
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've called it it's a worksheet and we
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
try to put in there all the information
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
that the agencies provide you as it
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
relates to their revenue estimates so
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
you can see it in one
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
place if you flip to the page five
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see that what we do with the Dr
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
estimates because they typically are the
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
only agency that provides you a range we
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
try to provide a separate table with the
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
range of their estimates and then
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
looking on page six you'll see the
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that we fill out as it
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
relates to the general and education
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund we give you what the two
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
years ago so fiscal you'll see fiscal 22
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
when this was done for the last
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
operating budget we had fiscal 22 what
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
the official plan was for revenues 25
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
what the official plan or 20 excuse me
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
23 what the official plan was any
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
adjustments that the governor might have
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
made and then the agency's estimates
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
followed by what the house Ways and
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
Means estimates might be so you go
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
through that process you you'll end up
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
doing doing some work sessions to um
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
determine what you agree to as the
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
numbers for the committee you do the
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
same thing for the highway fund and for
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
the fishing game fund and I noticed that
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
represent Brier isn't here today but um
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
as many of you have probably heard he
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
worked for Department of Safety before
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
retiring and he did was the director of
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
road tolls which is the entity that
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
collects all the highway funds so you've
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
got an expert on your committee to to
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
talk about that when it comes
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
time once the committee has done all its
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
work and come to an agreement on what
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
they believe the revenue estimates
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
should be if you turn to page
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
14 typically there's a resolution put
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
together for the house and we take the
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year with the official
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
estimate was any revisions so the one
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at is hr17 for the 2023
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
session you'll see that the official
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
estimate was the first column then the
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee estimate so that would be any
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments you might make because you
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
have better information on what the
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
revenue stream is is like at that moment
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then what your estimates for 24 and
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
25 are typically this goes to the house
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
tabled from there I take these numbers
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
we do an amendment to House Bill one so
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you turn to
 
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
if you turn to
page

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
21 house bill one is the operating
 
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
21 house bill one is the operating
budget

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
typically so we prepare an amendment
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
usually in the chair of of finance's
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
name and we take the house Ways and
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
Means official estimates and we put them
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
into this this amendment to the house
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh to House Bill one or the
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget those become the
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
numbers that the house finance committee
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
is using to make sure they come up with
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
a balance budget for the
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
unrestricted um entities so we do again
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
you do it for your general funds Highway
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
funds and then your fishing game fund
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the same process when
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
we move on to the Senate our office
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
works for both the Senate and the house
 
00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.470 align:start position:0%
works for both the Senate and the house
we

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan um so we'll go through this
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
same process with the Senate um we'll
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
come back and report to you what changes
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate might have made um your
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee will decide if you agree
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
disagree um and in most years there's a
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee a conference where you um the
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies will come together
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
and and hash out their final agreement
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
which you usually involves a several
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
members of ways and means that we'll
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
look at the final numbers and come to
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
some conclusion on what they believe
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
be as you move as the process moves
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
along now um you turn to page
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
23 your committee is going to be seeing
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
bills you're going to have bills that
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
are may impact Revenue when you're doing
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
your estimates you're doing your
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
estimates on what current law is today
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
not what bills you might pass from this
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
body from this committee or the house
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
body what we do on our office on the
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement which you can see
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
starts on
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
23 we'll make adjustments for changes
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
that the bodies agree to so if the house
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
passes a bill that changes the interest
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
rate um for or the tax rate for the one
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the business taxes we'll put a line
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement accounting for
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
that change so you it will then be
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
netted against any estimates you have
 
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
netted against any estimates you have
have

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
provided that may change when it gets to
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate that's why we ask the revenue
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
estimates be done based on current
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
law and if you turn to page
 
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.270 align:start position:0%
law and if you turn to page
um

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
26 just to show
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
you rows two through S it's called
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
schedule two and it's rows two through 7
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
26 those would be all revenue
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were made
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
the last operating budget and you'll see
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
what the governor proposed what the
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
house proposed what the Senate proposed
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
if there had been a committee of
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
conference there would be a last fourth
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
column that would be the committee of
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
Conference Final
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
proposal um but you can see that for
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
instance the one of the big changes last
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
time was how much how you did the split
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
for the um general fund education trust
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
fund for the business taxes it used to
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
be a fairly
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
complicated calculation now it's just a
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
great percentage and you can see the
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
house had one percentage the governor
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
had a different percentage and the
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
senate had a third percentage and we
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
make those adjustments within the um
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
final operating budget so that we know
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
that um you have a bounced budget that
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
you will pass at least based on what the
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
best estimates of that
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
day so when uh would a committee of
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
conference come in because all these
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
estimates are different so what how do
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
these get so in 2023 the um the house
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
accepted the changes from the Senate and
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
the bill went forward so there was no
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference okay if there
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
had been um a decision for a committee
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
of conference that would have occurred
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the June time frame um and we would
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
have had a fourth column here where you
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
would have seen any agreements or things
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
that you agreed to keep doing or things
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to do would come out and
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
they it have a new number for the Cs
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference um final vote
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Aly
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes just to be clear a June time frame
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
means that at least some of us all of us
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
have to be here at the very end of June
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
to vote on the final
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
decision and typically for the house
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill one house bill two Committee of
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
conference there's a couple of house
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Comm members that are
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
assigned to that um it it varies from
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
time to time but um my experience has
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
been uh that that the ways and means
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
members from both the house and the
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
Senate will typically take a moment and
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
discuss the estimates and may come back
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
to the committee of conference with
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
suggestions on what they can agree to or
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
not agree to between the two
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
bodies um no guarantee that's going to
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
happen this time because that's up to
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
leaderships of both sides to determine
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
um how they want to go forward with a
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee of conference okay any other
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
question but I just more importantly
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
that the piece that I want you to take
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
away from that is as you work on
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
bills if you pass pass those from the
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
house to the Senate we will take care of
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
that on the Surplus statement we'll
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
account for that additional revenue or
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
the reduction of Revenue depending on
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
what the Bill's doing so so when you're
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
doing your Revenue estimates in the next
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks it's getting just on
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
current law not in the bills you may be
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
working on at that same
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
time any other questions are we good
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
everything's Crystal Clear good all
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
right continue if you p uh skip to page
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
36 so you wonder what happens to all
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
this information you know once it's gone
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
through the legislative body and been
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
signed into law by the governor it then
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
goes over to the Department of
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
administrative services and they put
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
together the revenue
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
plan and the revenue plan basically
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
takes the total number of revenue for
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
the year and tries to allocate it by
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
month it's an estimated allocation it's
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
based on typically on percentages of
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
Prior years or maybe a a new known issue
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
that the agency knows that we got to
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
collect money um in this month more so
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
than we did in other months due to some
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
change in law so the the monthly Revenue
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
plan just gives you a sense of how we're
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
doing how we trending so this is the
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
official estimate this is what is bound
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
by law it doesn't
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
change um so even if in the second year
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
of the session you pass bills that have
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
an impact on Revenue it won't change the
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
official plan they'll make a note of it
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
um as they collect the revenue and the
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
revenue Focus potentially and that would
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
be the next thing you would look at um
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
on page 40 and I think that your very
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
first meeting um I think representative
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
janigan mentioned the revenue
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
Focus so that is the document that the
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
issues at the end of every month that
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
tells you how you did on a month on a
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
monthly basis so what you were
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
anticipated to collect for each of the
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
revenue sources the unrestricted revenue
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
for um the general fund and the
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as well as the
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
highway fund and um fishing game fund
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
but but the front page typically focuses
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
on the general fund education trust fund
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's for the current month on the right
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
hand side there's a column that will
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
have little narratives those are the
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
agencies will work with administrative
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
services to comment on what might have
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
happened in that month why did we get so
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
much more Revenue than usual or why was
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
it less or why does it go in this bucket
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
and not that bucket
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
you'll then you'll see that that that's
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
the um year-to date so it's the same
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
idea but it's what you've collected
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
year-to date you can see you know
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
through in this instance it's through
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
December 2025 you can see how much
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
you've collected for the general fund
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
how much you've collected for the
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and how that
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
compares to what your plans were for
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
each of those and if you were to go down
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
to the total receipts line You'll see
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the general fund which is the first
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh column is $12.6 million ahead of plan
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
through December you go to the middle
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
column which is the education trust fund
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the education trust fund
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
is $ 53.8 million below plan and then
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
when you get to the total the two of
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
those net out and you'll see that
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
you're 41 um2 million below plan
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
overall thank you Mike uh Kane came and
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
spoke to you from our office the other
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
day and he suggested that point in time
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to close the year out we
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
would be about $25 million in the
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
whole uh of General funds so based on
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and other activities that
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
have occurred um you know your revenues
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
are are not as strong as they were
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
originally anticipated to
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
be but there may be different reasons
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then on the LA you turn the page the
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
43 the last page of the revenue Focus
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
you have the highway fund and the
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund again those those are
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
two other unrestricted Revenue sources
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
that this committee will be weighing in
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
on and providing an estimate based on um
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
you the remainder of the document is um
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
basically the rsas that um allow for the
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
taxes to be collected it shows you the
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
rates and such but I'm not going to go
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
through through
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to give you kind of a
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
couple minutes of why I'm here to help
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
guide you through this process and make
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
sure that your decisions are put into
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
the places they need to be so they end
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
up in a house resolution and they end up
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the house bill one Amendment for your
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue I'm also here to
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
help bring the agencies in so that you
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
can hear them present on the different
 
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.830 align:start position:0%
can hear them present on the different
Revenue

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
sources I'm here also
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
to uh track down information that you
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
might find you need for the committee I
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
may not have it myself but I may need to
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
find a resource that can get it to you
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's all I had for you um I'll
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
be here as you work on your unrestricted
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
revenues and then once that's done you
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
won't see much of me because I'll be
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
working with the Senate and doing other
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
things but then I'll be coming back um
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
as we get closer to the end of the
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
Senate process to um let you know what's
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
been happening unless I'm invited back
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
um for a specific
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
reason so I don't know if anybody has
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
any questions or I guess uh I have a
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
general question um so if we look at
 
00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:33.909 align:start position:0%
general question um so if we look at
page

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
42 the um so far the total total
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
receipts are 12.6 million ahead of plan
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
for general for the general
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
fund and the education uh trust fund is
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
53 million below planned um is in a
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
nutshell could you tell us
 
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
why why that is so much lower in general
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
what what is that pulling from or why is
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
there a way to summarize that um so you
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
can see that most of the the issue is
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
with your business
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
taxes you know you get a $54 million and
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
then your tobacco tax which has been
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
million okay they're generally both
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
coming in less than what was planned for
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
um there may be some other issues with
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
the business taxes I can't relate to or
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
I discuss with you that that would
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
probably be more appropriate for
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
Lindsay's team to mention to you because
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
I just don't know right um but there may
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
be some issues with when we did the
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
estimates originally we estimated that
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
um the splits between the business bet
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
and BPT um were different than what
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing today that may be having an
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
impact on some of this as well um Dr as
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
many of you who have been around know
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
they have a computer system they call
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
rims that um they put in a few years
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
years back and that's allowed them to
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
have a better sense of uh their revenue
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
Collections and where the how they are
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
coming in and particularly with their
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
business taxes where they belong so if a
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is filing their business
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
estimates and they put everything in bet
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
Dr can see that well typically X
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
percentage is your bet X percentage is
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
your BPT so they just move that
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
automatically for you that may be part
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
of what's happening in the business tax
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
row um but overall your business taxes
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
are not coming in as
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
planned okay representative ORS uh thank
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
question so uh I was a little curious
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
about two things the tobacco tax why
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
might that be down so
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
much well I think when we made the
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates back in 2023 it was
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
based on numbers that you were seeing
 
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of covid and so when people
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
were home tobacco was up oh okay um the
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
sense is that when people are in their
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
home environment they not as reluctant
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
to have a cigarette or take a break for
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
a cigarette or smoke while they're
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
working whereas when you're in the
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
workplace you can't do that as people
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
have moved back into um the offices
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's been less of that so that's part
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
of it so our base may have been off to
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
um there's also the
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
um for the for the tobacco you have the
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
electric electronic cigarettes those
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
when when they're tax it all goes into
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the general fund cigarettes are split
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
between the general fund and the
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so that may be why
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're seeing less going into the
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as well but again
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to Dr because they're much
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable about these issues
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
than I okay and the second part of that
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
question would be the uh out ofate
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
sales I read somewhere we we we make
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
on people coming across the border like
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
they do to buy liquor do you know what
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
that number is I don't I know that when
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
um there's estimates made around
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
changing a a tobacco tax rate there's
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
conversation about how how much you're
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
pulling across the border and if you go
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
too high you're going to lose those
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
crossb sales but I don't have a
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
percentage as to what that
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
is so when Dr comes up they'll be able
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
to be more specific with those sorts of
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
questions Chris is giving us the overall
 
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.149 align:start position:0%
questions Chris is giving us the overall
process

00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
but fair questions fair questions and
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
now Dr is going to be ready to answer
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
up all right good morning Mr chair
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Lindsay stpp
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and I'm here to
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
again walk through the various taxes
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
that Dr collects some of this
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
information will be repetitive from what
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
I gave last week but if you're anything
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
like me it sometimes doesn't stick till
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
the second or third time that you hear
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
it so um and then there's also some
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
additional information in here to really
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
kind of get you set and ready to do your
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimating uh process that Chris
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
just described well this is also a more
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
a deeper dive correct we are also going
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
to do a deeper dive to the taxes as well
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're scheduled for
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
two hours
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll get to uh spend some quality
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
morning um okay so first um on page two
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more information about
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue so I've
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
included here our mission
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
statement which is to fairly and
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
efficiently administer the tax laws of
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire collecting
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
the proper amount of taxes due while in
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
current ing the least cost to taxpayers
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
in a manner that merits the highest
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
degree of public confidence in our
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
integrity further we provide prompt and
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
constructive assistance to the municipal
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
units of government in the matters of
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
Budget Finance and the appraisal of real
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
estate so as I talked a little bit about
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
last week we we are the primary um
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
revenue and tax collection agency but we
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
also support the municipalities um for
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
the collection of local property taxes
 
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.430 align:start position:0%
the collection of local property taxes
as

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
well on page three just in terms of
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
interaction with our taxpayers the
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
policy of the Department of Revenue to
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
administer the tax laws in a manner that
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrates efficiency fairness and
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
courtesy towards every taxpayer um one
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the ways that we kind of monitor this
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
is when taxpayers call into our call
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
center they have an opportunity at the
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
end of the call to rate the knowledge
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
and professionalism of the person that
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
they spoke to on the phone and they're
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
also able to leave us a comment if they
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
have anything else to say and we
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
routinely score a five out of five on
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
the professionalism and knowledge of
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
oury employees um and we get some funny
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
comments from time to time that things
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
like oh this is so much better than
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
calling the IRS or
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um I'm just happy you guys
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
answer the phone no one answers the
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
phone anymore these days so we do try
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
our very best to make sure that our
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um are satisfied it's not
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's favorite task to pay taxes
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
but we try to make it as painless as
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
possible on page four this is just um
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
our organizational chart just to give
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
you a little bit more perspective on the
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
department so there's the commissioner
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
and assistant commissioner and then
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see our primary divisions the
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
administration unit the audit division
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
the collections division Municipal and
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
property Division and taxpayer services
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
and then below each division you'll see
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
kind of some of the primary functions um
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
so the way that this is structured
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
really is if you're not under audit and
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to collect money from
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
you that's overdue most of your
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
interactions are going to be with our
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
tax payer services division so they man
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
our call center they process our Revenue
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
they process our
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
documents um that has allowed for a fair
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
bit of efficiency within the department
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
and so all of your routine interactions
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
are kind of going to be in that one
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
division the municipal and property unit
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
is the folks that interact most closely
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
with our um Municipal officials and our
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
local governments and then the
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
administration unit is kind of all the
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
back office functions of the
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
department within the administration
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
unit on page five we have tax policy and
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
legislative analysis group and that
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
those are folks that are sitting behind
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
me today we have Jennifer Ramsay who's
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
our tax policy Council Lauren O Sullivan
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
is our senior financial analyst and Gita
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
rala is our financial analyst those are
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
the folks you're going to see for the
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
most part um in terms of testifying on
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of bills explaining fiscal notes
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so you'll get to
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
know them quite well they do prepare our
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheets and also some
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note quick guides which is kind
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
of a I don't know a more simpler version
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
of a fiscal note kind of easier to
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand that will provide to the
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee to assist you with the bills
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
where there's a fiscal impact they also
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
work with you as legislators in
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
analyzing tax policy and the associated
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact you will see them in
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee hearings they will testify
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
regarding um tax impact they track all
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and then they um
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
assist the department in Rule and form
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
changes that are the result of new laws
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
that are finally passed at the end of
 
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
that are finally passed at the end of
the

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
year on page
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
six um the taxes at the Dr administer is
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
approximately $2.9 billion in Revenue so
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
here you have the taxes on the left you
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
have the current tax rate in the middle
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
column and then you have the relevant
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
statutes on the right so this can kind
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
of be a nice frame of reference if you
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
ever have any questions about the
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
current rates or how the tax
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
um are structured in the law you can
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
reference this slide um as Chris
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are a few taxes that we
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
do not collect we do not collect the
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax uh we do not
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
collect although I think a fair number
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
of us pay into the beer tax um and we do
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
tax on page seven looking at a breakdown
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
of the taxes for fiscal year 2024
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue you will see business business
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
taxes collected uh just over 1.2
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
billion uh meals and rooms tax 328
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
million utility property tax 46.8
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
million just to give you a summary
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
billion we have a question represent Aly
 
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.589 align:start position:0%
billion we have a question represent Aly
thank

00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
you um preliminary we don't have
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
anything from the cfer yet right the AER
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
has not been issued yet I believe Mike
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
Kane spoke about that last week um the
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
expectation is it'll be out either at
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
the end of this month or maybe um during
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
February so these are preliminary
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
numbers we would typically include the
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
AC for numbers here um but these are
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
based off the preliminary PR preliminary
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
acral that's issued by the department of
 
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.870 align:start position:0%
acral that's issued by the department of
administrative

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
services do you know why it's taken so
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
long um I believe Mike explained that
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
part of the delay is the um transition
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
to a new system at The Liquor Commission
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
and um making sure that that is all
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
working and um reporting
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
properly so everything else would be
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay sort of as we can get right so um I
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't expect there to be significant
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
variation between these preliminary
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
numbers and the actual AER um when it's
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
issued with respect to any of the taxes
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
that Dr collects there's usually only
 
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
that Dr collects there's usually only
minor

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments um on page eight this is
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
just a kind of a pie of what um the
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund Revenue
 
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund Revenue
looks

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
looks
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
like so dr's responsibilities are are in
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
bold face um and you'll see that that
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
equals about
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
here I would note um as was mentioned by
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
the treasurer during your present ations
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
last week that other which is currently
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
6% that includes interest that's been
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
earned on um monies that are sitting in
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
state accounts and that's higher than
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's been in other years due to the
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
amount of um Federal stimulus money that
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
spent okay moving to page nine the goal
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
here is to go through um each of the
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
taxes give an overview of the tax give a
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
trend history of the tax and then as um
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
the chair mentioned kind of dive a
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper into some additional
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
information unlike last time we're going
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
to lead with business taxes um and then
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
it'll get easier from here so first up
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
is the business profits
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
tax on the left hand side here you'll
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
see just a general overview of the tax
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
so the current rate is
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
75% every Enterprise organized for gain
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
or profit carrying carrying on any
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
business activity in the state is
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax and then in the third
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
bullet you'll see gross business income
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
in excess of $109,000 from all
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
activities that's the filing threshold
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
so any business that has gross business
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
income of
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
$109,000 or more is required to file and
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
that threshold is updated based on CPI
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
every two
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
years on the right hand side of the page
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see when people file and pay and
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is based on calendar year fil which
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
is roughly 90% of our
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so partnership returns are
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
going to be due on March 15th corporate
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
proprietorship and fiduciary returns are
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
due April
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
15th businesses do have a seven-month
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
extension to file but not to pay so long
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
as their account is fully paid by either
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
that March 15th or April 15th deadline
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
they have an automatic 7-month extension
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then they make estimated payments
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
equal to 25% of their liability on April
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
15th June 15th September 15th and
 
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
15th June 15th September 15th and
December

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
15th going to slide
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
10 this is a little bit
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
complicated so fair warning
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
but what we're trying to show here is
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
how a taxpayer with a calendar
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
year how their
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
payments will flow into the state's
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year because calendar year and
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year are
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
offset so at the top of the page you'll
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
see a calendar year tax filer that goes
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
from January 2024 to December
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
2024 you'll see those four quarterly
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
estimated payments in April June
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
September and December those are in
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
green you'll see their return
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
s in blue either in March April or May
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
depending on their entity type but then
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
if they file that return on extension if
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
they get that automatic seven-month
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
extension to fill out the return you'll
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
see those com in in the fall in October
 
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
see those com in in the fall in October
November

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
December so those returns in blue and in
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
red are actually the returns from the
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
prior calendar
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
year so you'll see that really when we
 
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.589 align:start position:0%
year so you'll see that really when we
get

00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
returns they're almost a full year late
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say late because they're not
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
late they're on time but a full year
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
since the end of the taxable period so
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
it can be a while before we at Dr get
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
that nice return with all of the
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
information on it that tells us what's
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
going on with that business prior to
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
that point the only information we have
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
is the estimated payments that that
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
they've made and those estimate forms
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
some of you have heard me joke about
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
this before those estimate forms are
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
very simple it's a name a taxpayer ID
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
number a period end date and a dollar
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
amount there's no little love note that
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
tells me why they're paying more or less
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
than they did previously it's just money
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
in the door so it's not until that final
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
return is filed that I really can dig
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
into what is going on with that business
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
why did they pay more or
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
less we have a question question uh
 
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
less we have a question question uh
represent

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
elme yes thank you uh do you
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
actually do a penalty if they had
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
paid what they thought they owed at the
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
beginning but not what they actually
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
outed in the in the extension so there
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
are um penalties in statute if they
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't pay proper estimated payments um
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that they can kind of
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
have a safe harbor they won't be
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
penalized if they essentially make
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
estimated payments equal to their prior
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
Year's liability because we know that
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's fluctuations in liability of
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
businesses from year to year and so they
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
may not be totally aware of what their
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate liability will be and so so
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
long as those estimated payments are
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
roughly equal to what they paid in the
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
prior year then they won't be penalized
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
they do need to make that payment though
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
that catchup if there is an amount due
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
that does have to be paid in March or
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
April depending on the due date that
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
extension again is only an extension to
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
file so in filling out that final return
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
if it find if a taxpayer finds that they
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
owe additional money there will be
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
penalties associated with
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
that representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea how much money's in
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
the tube of the prior year taxes to be
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.349 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily um what we're seeing and
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about this in a little bit
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is really a decline in
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
estimated payments as businesses are
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat changing their behavior and how
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're sending estimates to us but we
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
really won't know what is actually due
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
for those businesses until those returns
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
are filed either timely or on extension
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
and as I just said on extension it's
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
almost a year after the end of the the
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
let me go to represent Opel and then
 
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.069 align:start position:0%
let me go to represent Opel and then
represent

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
question commissioner you may be getting
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
to this later so I may be Jumping the
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
Shark here but is their historical data
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
showing what the difference is either
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
positively or negatively between what
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
the estimated returns show and then what
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know when they when they finally
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
file the actual return there's a slide
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
that we'll get to in a couple minutes I
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
think that will kind of give you an idea
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
of of what that looks like um where you
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
can see kind of how the total revenue is
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
made up between returns estimates and
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
extensions follow up M follow um I
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
should have asked this before but if for
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are new the acronyms
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
that you and representative Aly we're
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the I'm assuming it's an
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
end ofe report correct the act for um is
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
the annual comprehensive financial
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
report and those are the full audited
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
financials of the state um and that's
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
produced by the department of
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services along with the
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
LBA and our external Auditors thank you
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be asking a lot of those no
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
Acron are you all set represent on me
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you okay and then
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
just on the bottom part or the second
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
half of this slide um we have the
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
state's fiscal
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
year and so you'll see during fiscal
 
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
year and so you'll see during fiscal
year

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
2025 we are going to get third and
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter estimated payments for
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
2024 and then we're going to get first
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
and second quarter estimated payments
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
for calendar year
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
25 we're also going to get
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
2023 Returns on
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
extension and we're going going to get
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
2024 timely filed returns so in the
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
state's fiscal year we are getting 2023
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
money 24 money and 25
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
money all for calendar year taxpayers so
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of kind of moving pieces
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why we do our best to kind of
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
break down the type of Revenue that
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
we're receiving um and what that means
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
when we're presenting to you about um
 
00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
when we're presenting to you about um
Revenue

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
estimates okay moving on to slide 11
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
this is where you'll see a historical
 
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
breakdown of returns estimates
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
extensions tax notice payments and
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
refunds so I
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
would first bring your attention to the
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
red those are your estimates and so
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
those are historically and currently the
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
most significant portion of the revenue
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
receive your returns and your extensions
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
are in that kind of Darker blue and
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
green and so those are the amounts that
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
were due that did not that were in
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
excess of the estimates that were
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
made and so to representative opal's
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
question you'll see in say fiscal year
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
22 and fiscal year 23 we we
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
saw um estimates increase in fiscal year
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
22 let's just use that as a as a single
 
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.910 align:start position:0%
22 let's just use that as a as a single
data

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
point estimates in red increased by
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
year returns and extensions increased by
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
11.5% and returns increased by
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
25.2% so those estimates did not cover
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
the total amount of liability due there
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
was some amount of money do at that
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
return point which is in the form of
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
either the return or an extension
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
payment to get that seven-month
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
extension you can see that's different
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
17 so I think what we've seen in the
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
past few years and this kind of tracks
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
with the idea of significant growth in
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
corporate profits is businesses were
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
making increased estimated payments and
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
they still found that they owed money at
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
too one other point that I would note on
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
this slide in fiscal year 24 in Orange
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
are the refunds so this is when a
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um has paid too much in their
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
estimated payments and there is some
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
amount of overpayment they can take that
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
as a credit carry forward essentially
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
leave that on their account for future
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
use or it can be paid back to them in in
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
the form of a refund what you're seeing
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 with almost a 90%
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
increase in refunds is the 500% cap on
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
their credit carryover liability so
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
businesses can now only keep on account
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
up to 500% of their liability so if
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
their liability was $100 they can't keep
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
on account more than
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
$500 if they their overpayment was $600
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
then we would be refunding $100 to them
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
so that CCO cap resulted in those
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
increased refunds is that uh 500% the of
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
the latest payment that would be 500% of
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
your prior Year's liability prior okay
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
correct yep so looking at the most
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
recent year you can only keep 500% okay
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
represent elme yes can you tell yet
 
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.230 align:start position:0%
represent elme yes can you tell yet
on

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether this surely isn't just the
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
people that were taking
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
refunds because they were over 500% or
 
00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:33.870 align:start position:0%
refunds because they were over 500% or
is

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
question as I was assuming that part of
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
this was people taking refunds earlier
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
since we were telling them they had
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
refunds in that extent and they hadn't
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
been thinking about
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
24 we
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
have hold on I just want to make sure I
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
right we had
 
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.829 align:start position:0%
right we had
71.7

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
71.7
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
million out of 176
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
million that were required to be
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
refunded per the CCO cap so yes there
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
are taxpayers that choose to take their
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
overpayment as a refund and there are
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that may even choose
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
to not just the forced over 500% but
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
they may want even more than
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
that but we've broken it out to identify
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
71.7 million essentially is what was
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
required to be refunded based on that
 
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.829 align:start position:0%
required to be refunded based on that
CCO

00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
welcome okay moving on to slide
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
12 as I mentioned estimates make up the
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
largest portion of our revenue and so
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
who pays those
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
estimates this chart shows in red our
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
corporations so the majority of our
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
estimate Revenue comes from
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
corporations followed by Partnerships
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
proprietorships and
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries the percentage percentages
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
that are contained within the bar chart
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
are the change from the prior year so in
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 we saw just about a 6%
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
increase in estimated payments from
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
corporations a 21% decrease from
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and a 5.3% decrease from
 
00:52:51.079 --> 00:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and a 5.3% decrease from
proprietorships

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
on slide
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
13 this just kind of another way to look
 
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.470 align:start position:0%
13 this just kind of another way to look
at

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
this for BPT taxpayers about 2.7% of our
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
filers pay
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
84.1% of the tax so I'll say that again
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
less than 3% of the
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
filers pay 84% of the tax so what you
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
see in the pie chart on the left is this
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
is who is filing so these this is a
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
breakdown of your
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
filers and I will note here in red is
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
corporations but in purple you'll see
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's called Water's Edge so these are
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
our large multinational corporations so
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
we've kind of made a distinction between
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
the two so if you're a multinational
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
entity you are filling out a Waters Edge
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
return for us so those are the ones in
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
purple so you'll see 7% of our
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
filers for BP are Waters Edge but if you
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
move over to the
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
right 58% of our money comes from
 
00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
right 58% of our money comes from
Water's

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
Edge looking at corporations 37% of our
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
filers are
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
22% another comparison
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
35% of our filers are
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
proprietorships but they only pay
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
4% and this is shown also on the next
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
slide on page 14 this is an excerpt from
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
our annual
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
report we refer to these as the
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
triangles so those folks that have been
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
around for a while will hear us talk
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
triangles so this is just the source of
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
data for the prior slide but you can see
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
you get to that very tip of the triangle
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
those entities that are paying more than
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
Mill ion Dollar in
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
BPT they're 2% of the population but
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
they make up
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
revenue any questions on
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
BPT represent
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
elmy is this
 
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.910 align:start position:0%
elmy is this
uh

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
84% on
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
increasing over time I don't remember it
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
Vivid say relative to five years
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
ago I have a year I can do the prior
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
year pretty quickly so what you have in
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
front of you is for tax year
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
22 again because of that delayed that
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
tax year 22 is the most recently fully
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
complete tax year for
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
us if you look at tax year
 
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:13.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
be4 it's going to be very similar we can
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
go back and look at what it was five
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
years ago yeah just outside of the
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic y exactly pre pre pandemic
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
yeah well the other the other thing that
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
changed is that the thresholds for who's
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
going to file increased so I would guess
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
that that would lower the number of
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
proprietorships especially in small
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
corporations so therefore the numbers
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
are lower but the the percentage of the
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
larger filers gets
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
bigger and that's actually a great Point
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
what you'll see in this triangle on page
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
14 you will see you know we had 55 a
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
half thousand returns filed with a zero
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
liability because again that threshold
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
that I read off at the beginning is a
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
threshold to
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
file so we receive many returns where no
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
amount is due be because of deductions
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
or various other things so that's
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
something that we you know constantly
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
like reinforce with new businesses that
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
you may not owe anything but over a
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
certain amount you do have an obligation
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
to file so the the point of zero returns
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah does that answer your question uh
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
it sort of complicates it okay would you
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
like to ask your question I'm trying to
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
figure out if there's any way to analyze
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
those two separately
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
but really the increase in the threshold
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
should just decrease the amount of zero
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
returns that we receive that's um that's
 
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.670 align:start position:0%
returns that we receive that's um that's
expect

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the balance right and
 
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's why um those thresholds hadn't
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
been increased in quite some time and so
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
when the legislature decided to increase
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
the thresholds they also decided to put
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
in that adjustment every two years based
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
on CPI so that we can kind of inflation
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
adjust those thresholds so that we're
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
not yeah you know causing people to to
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
file and when that's not really the
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
intention so now we automatically update
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
those thresholds actually an interesting
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
follow up to that would
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
be when did it go when did that increase
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
2023 it's Rec yeah I think I feel like
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
it was 2023 so the most recent
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
threshold most recent threshold of
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
109,000 is going to be the current one
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
for tax bill periods beginning 1125 so
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh wait minute say that again so so we
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
do it every two years so the
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
109,000 but the 2023 is is affected by
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
that higher threshold correct okay so
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah so the threshold will
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
really just
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
impact the number of zero filers your
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
original question of kind of what is the
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
tip of that triangle look like we can
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
look at that going back to kind of pre-
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic um to better understand i' I'd
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
like to point out to people also that
 
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
like to point out to people also that
the

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
bet we
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
we fixed that threshold issue in
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
2011 representative oery suggested that
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
we ought to do the latest
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
one remembering what we' done a long
 
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.549 align:start position:0%
one remembering what we' done a long
time

00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay we good on business profits taxes
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
as good as we're going to
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
be there you go you
 
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.430 align:start position:0%
be there you go you
listening

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
listening
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
okay business Enterprise tax so the
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
current rate for the business Enterprise
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
tax is
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
0.55% of the Enterprise Value tax base
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
which is essentially wages interest paid
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
and dividends paid and that has been
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
12322 this is going to be a tax on every
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
profit or nonprofit Enterprise or
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
organization with any business activity
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
within the state except 501 c3s so 501
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
c3s are the only exception for the
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
tax here your filing threshold is
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
currently at
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
$298,000 for either gross receipts or
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
your Enterprise Value tax base and that
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
was adjusted just for uh recently for
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
1125 important thing to note about the
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
bet it is a credit against the
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
BPT so if you pay $100 in bet and your
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
BPT liability is
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
$100 you owe no BPT so it's a one for
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
one credit against the business profits
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
tax and that and any unused credit can
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
be carried forward for 10 years we have
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
worksheets on our forms that help
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
that the timing is consistent with the
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
business profits tax with Partnerships
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
return partnership returns du on March
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
15th corporate proprietorship and
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary returns due April 15th and
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
nonprofit returns due May 15th again
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for a 7-month
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
extension to file so long as your uh
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
liability is fully paid and estimates
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
are made at the same 25% at the same
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers going to slide
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
16 it's very
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
consistent with kind of the breakdown
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
that you saw with the business profits
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
tax although maybe not as pronounced
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
here but you have 4.6% so just under 5%
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
of filers paying 72% of
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
tax your firers are primarily
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
proprietorships but the money is
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
primarily from wat's Edge
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
corporations on page 17 you have that
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
same triangle just now with the with
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
only uh with the business Enterprise tax
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
and again that's the source for the
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
information on the prior slide as I said
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
very consistent in terms of few tax
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paying the majority of the tax
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
but I would say it's not as pronounced
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
tax going to page 18 you'll see kind of
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Trend when you put bet and
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
BPT together and as Chris mentioned what
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
we'll do for Revenue estimating is you
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
folks will estimate business taxes as a
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
whole and then we'll work with the LBA
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
to split that between bet and BPT based
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
on what we're seeing for most recent
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
filings um coming in from taxpayers and
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
then once it split between bet and BBT
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
it'll do the statutory split into the
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
general fund and the education trust
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
fund so you don't need to worry about
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
estimating one versus the other
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
especially where they're they interact
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
so much with the BET being accredit
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
against the BPT we'll just talk about
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
business taxes as a
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
whole and so you can see that we've seen
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in business taxes
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
from 2020 all the way to 2023 a slight
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
decline going into 24 and then we're
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
seeing that we're behind plan and behind
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
prior year going into
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
25 um as I mentioned last week I think
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is largely due to a change in
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
behavior of the
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um we are just not seeing them
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
sending the very large estimated
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
payments that we had been seeing in the
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
time from 2020 to 2023
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the economy is still growing
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's still growth within corporate
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
profits but it's not that extreme growth
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
that we were seeing during that time of
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
extreme growth many businesses don't
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
want to get be caught short on what they
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
owe at the end of the year even though
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
they might not be penalized they don't
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
want to face a large tax bill in April
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
and so they'll increase those estimated
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
payments and those estimated payments um
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
are just not increasing at the rate that
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
they were previously
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
we have a couple questions represent
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
ol thank you commissioner um given the
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
exuberance in the um previous in the
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
first Trump
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
Administration and the amount of Spike
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
that took
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
estimate will the downward Trend we've
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
seen over the last couple of years
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
continue or will it be a spike or will
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
it be a
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
gradual uh let's see how we're going
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
depending upon whether or not the job
 
01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.190 align:start position:0%
depending upon whether or not the job
tax

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
cut great question
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
so I will say a couple things first the
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
spike that we saw during um I'll just
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
say the first adoption the original
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
adoption of the tax cutting jobs
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
Act was was due to the fact um or what
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
was called deemed repatriation so
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses who had profits
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
that were um had remained overseas the
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
federal government said we're going to
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
tax that and when they did that kind of
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
freed up the flow of that money back to
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
the US so New Hampshire we did not tax
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
that deemed repatriation like the
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
federal government did we didn't
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
automatically tax it but we did tax it
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
when the actual cash came back in the
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
form of dividends so that's one place
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
that we saw a significant increase in
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue resulting from the tax cut and
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
jobs act so when those dividends were
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
actually paid back and there was no
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
federal liability at that point because
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
they had already paid the tax on it
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
freed up the cash to move back
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
domestically we taxed those dividends
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's a way that we saw an
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
revenue from the tax cut and jobs act
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
the second part of your question about
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
now is we I mentioned this last week too
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
but we New Hampshire is what's known as
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
a static Conformity state so we are
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
currently tied to the tcja we are
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
currently tied to the tax cut and jobs
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
act so in New Hampshire we're not
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily concerned about some of
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
these expiring provision iions because
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
our our code is the tax cut and jobs
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
act but if those expiring Provisions are
 
01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:36.750 align:start position:0%
act but if those expiring Provisions are
unexpired

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
unexpired
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
extended put in permanently Etc to the
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
extent that that generates corporate
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
profit if that is viewed positively by
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
the business community and that allows
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
for their profits to grow we would then
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
see an increase in our Revenue here in
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a result so anytime
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
corporate profits grow that's a good
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
thing but we're not necessarily directly
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
tied to whether or not the tcja is
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
extended so that's that's because we're
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
not uh we have the delay we have the
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
static Conformity we're not a rolling
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
Conformity state where we just
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
automatically pick up the changes at the
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal level so to answer your question
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'll see the spike that
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
we did under the first tcja because that
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
was somewhat unique to that deemed
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
repatriation and that's already happened
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
you can't really do it
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
again and second
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
um any extension of the tax cut and jobs
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
act to the extent that that generates
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
corporate profits would benefit
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
us as it flows down to the state level
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow up no no she she just said thank
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
you very much all right representative
 
01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:57.709 align:start position:0%
you very much all right representative
opal

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm spent a few years at the Pentagon
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
and got a little confused with fiscal
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
year versus budget year versus so I'm
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
just I just want to make sure I
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
understand we have essentially three
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
terms now we have a calendar year we
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a state fiscal year July 1 to June
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
30 correct and then we have in these
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
documents the tax year and I'm trying to
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand is the tax year based on New
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fiscal year or or the or the
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
entities tax year or how does that work
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
correct it's the entity's tax year and
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
so for 90% of our taxpayers that
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year and tax year are going to
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
be the same but for that remaining 10%
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
who might be on a fiscal year who might
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
follow the federal fiscal year if
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're a defense contractor Etc then um
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to look to so when we say
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
tax year 22 it's going to be the tax
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
year that began in 22 so for most the
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
calendar year and the tax year are one
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
and the same but if they don't file on a
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
calendar year basis then we look to the
 
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.229 align:start position:0%
calendar year basis then we look to the
tax

01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
year representative elme thank you so
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I totally understand
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
this on when we were
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
taxing on returns
 
01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
taxing on returns
dividends

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
on we were not
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
taxing uh
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
them in the interest in dividends area
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
profits well so we're taxing the the the
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend so you have a say a US
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
parent and a foreign Sub in Ireland and
 
01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:49.390 align:start position:0%
parent and a foreign Sub in Ireland and
there

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
was some amount of retained profits in
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
Ireland over some period of time when
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
they pay that dividend back they say
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
Okay parent I'm going to give you
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
$100 that is taxable for BPT purposes
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's a foreign dividend that's taxable
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
if the parent then takes that $100 and
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
distributes it out in the form of
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
dividends to shareholders then that
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
would get taxed under
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
indd except it
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't no not anymore at the time it
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
did yes that's why I wanted to know
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the sub to the parent dividend is
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
going to be taxed under the BPT and then
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
the distribution or dividend out to
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
shareholders it would be taxed under the
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
etc okay okay okay one last slide on
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes um just to be thorough so
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's a few recent business tax
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
changes that I just wanted to highlight
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
let's skip the first two for a second
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
the third one is the CCO cap which we've
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
talked quite a bit about so you'll see
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
the 500% of total tax liability for tax
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31st
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
of 2022 that will decrease to 250% and
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
then down to 100% but those dates have
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
been kicked out to 1231 29 and 12
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
3131 so we don't need to worry about it
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
at this point are you seeing any
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior change in businesses I mean of
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
course they have to know about the
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
change and I think they given the size
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
of the refunds that we paid out last
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
year I think they learned pretty quickly
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
about the change if they didn't know it
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
in advance they figured it out when you
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
know we paid out significantly more in
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
almost 90% more in refunds than we
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
typically do and that could also be a
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
part of the reduced estimated payments
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing and the reduced
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we're seeing is the change
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
in behavior um they don't want to leave
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
as much on account because they they're
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
going to have to end up getting it
 
01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
back um the last bullet just notes the
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
most recent change to the BPT from 7.6%
 
01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.510 align:start position:0%
most recent change to the BPT from 7.6%
to

01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
123123 the first two um bullets I'll
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
just mention briefly these are changes
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
to apportionment and so apportionment
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
matters when you operate in multiple
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
States how do you take your P of profit
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and split it up so let's just say you're
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
in you operate only in New England and
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
you have $100 in profit well how much of
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that profit is Maine New Hampshire or
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts apportionment statutes is
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
how you divide up that profit and so New
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made a couple of changes
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
recently one for 12 3121 and then one
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
for 12
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
3122 so on 12
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
3121 we went to what's called
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and so this is
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
only for the apportionment of services
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
so if you're an accountant if you're a
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
lawyer you're providing
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
Services market-based sourcing looks to
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the customer of that
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
service so if your $100
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
pie if half of your customers are in
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts then $50 is going to go to
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts prior to market-based
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
sourcing we looked at where that service
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
was performed and so if you were a New
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire accountant and you did all
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
your work in New Hampshire but you had
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
clients in Maine New Hampshire and
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we said we don't care
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
where your clients are if you're
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
performing the service here you're going
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
to allocate that profit here so this
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
shifted to say where is the
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
customer so that's the first change the
 
01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.430 align:start position:0%
customer so that's the first change the
second

01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
um when you look at a business who has
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
payroll property and sales that's really
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately how we're going to distribute
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
your pie we used to look at all three
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
factors we looked where's your payroll
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
where are your people where's your
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
property and then where are your
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
sales for 1231 22 now we only look at
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
sales so we're only looking to wear
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
again similar to Market base sourcing
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
where is the ultimate customer and where
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
is your
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
sale these changes are consistent with
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
what other states have done as well and
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
so that helps to limit taxpayers being
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
taxed on more than their total pie
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
because if the states don't abortion the
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
pi the same way you could end up paying
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
tax on more than your whole Pi when you
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
have uniformity and consistency between
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
states you will never get taxed on more
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
than 100% of your pie so these were
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
positive I think for the businesses at
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
least from a compliance perspective um
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
it made compliance easier and reduced
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
that risk that you would be taxed on
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
100% um it will have some Revenue
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
impacts it is hard to know the impact of
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing because we didn't
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
have the data previously we knew where
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
the services were being performed but we
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily know where the
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
customers were so that one was harder to
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
estimate but for single sales factor
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
that move away from the three factors to
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
only using one we had that data and so
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
it would be some years it would be
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue positive some years it would be
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue negative it really just
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
depended um so unfortunately our
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
estimate for that wasn't the most
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't want to say accurate it
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
was accurate but it was variable from
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
year to year I think we have a question
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind representative shamber
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner can you give us a $100
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
example like you've done with the others
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
this show Revenue reduction
 
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
so with the three Factor
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment we're now I if you um had
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
employees I'll I'll go back okay I'll a
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
$100 example if you had $25 a payroll in
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and 25% of your property
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
was in New Hampshire and 50% of your
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
sales were in New
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's how we would apportion
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
it under the three
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
Factor now all that we look at is those
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
sales and again it can be Revenue
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
positive or negative depending on the
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
year and depending on the taxpayers the
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
thing to know about single sales factor
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
is out of those three things payroll
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
property and sales sales is the most
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
variable it's harder to get rid of
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
property or acquire it at this
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
point changes in in
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
payroll tend to take time they don't
 
01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.149 align:start position:0%
payroll tend to take time they don't
happen

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
overnight but changes to your
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
sales can happen pretty quickly you can
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
get a new contract you could lose a
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
contract um and so out of those three
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
factors sales is where we see kind of
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
ery thank you commissioner I remember
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
back in 2021 when we put in the this
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
this was due to a particularly large
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
Distributing Company in New Hampshire uh
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
being taxed for the same sales yes twice
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
correct uh I guess in New Hampshire and
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
in Maine correct lesser degree in
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.390 align:start position:0%
in Maine correct lesser degree in
Massachusetts

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
sense but I'm thinking about a service
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
only Co
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
corporation like somebody on Elm Street
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
in Manchester one of the towers also has
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
offices in Boston and in
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
London how does that work if you could
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
give us an
 
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
give us an
example

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
so under Market based sourcing we're
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
just going to look to where the customer
 
01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.669 align:start position:0%
just going to look to where the customer
is

01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
so that complies followup thank you
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
followup

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
therefore the taxation policy using this
 
01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing comports with
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
Equitable and proportionate because it's
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
Equitable for the sales and activity
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
that takes place within the state and
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
that also comports with the general uh
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
IRS regulation of where the activity
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
takes place is that correct correct
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
Market based sourcing as I said Market
 
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:07.639 align:start position:0%
based sourcing and single sales factor a
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
portion men are are used widely across
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
States thank you thank you very much
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
welcome yes represent elberger thank you
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you commissioner just
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
let me try to wrap my head around this
 
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.669 align:start position:0%
let me try to wrap my head around this
my

01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
my sister and I inherited a investment
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
person for my parents who got this
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
person when they lived in
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
Florida they still are in the the
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
company is still in Florida I live here
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
and my sister lives in Georgia yep so
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
based on this system the company would
 
01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.189 align:start position:0%
based on this system the company would
be

01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
be
paying

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
paying
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
taxes for the services they provide to
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
me here in Georgia in New Hampshire and
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
my sister in Georgia but not for
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of us in Florida
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
correct and similarly when we got
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
someone else doing some tax stuff for us
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that company would have
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
would now only be paying for taxes in
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when we were there but not
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
because they were here correct thank you
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
y we're just going to we're going to
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
look to the customer thank you
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's more complicated than that I don't
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
mean to make it sound really simple
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
because a portion is one of the most
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
complex things that we do um but it
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
really it just all comes down to how do
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
you divide up that pie where do where
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
does the profit go where does it get
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
taxed represent
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
elme thank you so in my city we have
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Nova norus which is from Denmark I
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
believe it is nor way I can't remember
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.390 align:start position:0%
uh and
on

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
anything that they basically are selling
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
for the American market so that's one
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
thing but we also have uh the largest
 
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
thing but we also have uh the largest
laser

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
laser
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh company in the world uh which is
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
selling all over the globe now since
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
we're selling to Brazil brail and China
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
and a number of other places on that
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get taxed at all right correct
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
CU that's where we're going to go to the
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
edge okay good
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
okay on to meals and rooms or meals and
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
rentals however you want to refer to it
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
so M&amp;R is an 8 and a half% tax on meals
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
rooms in motor vehicle rentals the tax
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
is paid by the consumer so you pay it on
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
your bill when you go out to eat and
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
collected by the operator that's
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
remitted to us um on your behalf from
 
01:23:10.679 --> 01:23:11.430 align:start position:0%
remitted to us um on your behalf from
the

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
operator for doing that work they get to
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
retain uh 3% of the taxes that they
 
01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
collect so long as they meet
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of filing and
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
paying the state on a timely
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
basis the operat ERS file on a monthly
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
basis 15th day of the month every month
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
they do that via electronic filing it's
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
the easiest for most of them and a paper
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
return is not required um so it's pretty
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
easy they can use our Granite tax
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
connect portal and make their monthly um
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
us on page 21 there are two transfers
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
that come out of M&amp;R so two amounts
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
every month month that come out of the
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
the gross M&amp;R Revenue that we collect
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
the first is the school building Aid
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
Debt Service and in fiscal year 25
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's just about 6.6 million we divide
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
that up across the various months um you
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
will see that's down from a high of
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
almost 14 A5 million back in 2012 and we
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
have one two three four five more years
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
to go on this building Aid Debt Service
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
the other transfer that comes out on a
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
monthly basis is the municipal Revenue
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
fund so beginning in fiscal year
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
2022 30% of net M&amp;R from the most
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
recently completed fiscal year is
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
distributed to cities in
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
towns so that started as 100.1 million
 
01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.109 align:start position:0%
towns so that started as 100.1 million
in

01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
22 121 million in
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
23 13.9 and 24 and up to 136 .6 in
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
25 this is a replacement for a historic
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
provision in statute which actually was
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
going to distribute 40% of net M&amp;R
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue but that was routinely capped
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see there's a history down
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
there from 2013 to
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
2021 um you see it was capped at 58.8
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
million then it went up to
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
63.8 then it went went to
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
68.8 um and so there was a change in the
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
statute for for fiscal year 22 that
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
reduced the amount that is going to go
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
to cities and towns from 40% to 30 but
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
essentially removed that cap and that
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
money goes on a monthly basis into a
 
01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:36.109 align:start position:0%
money goes on a monthly basis into a
dedicated

01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
fund so that comes out every month um
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
but when you're comparing fiscal year 21
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
to 22 Revenue you just need to know that
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's $100 million that came out and
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
went into a dedicated fund so it's not
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
comparison on page 22 and we talked
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit last week this
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
is just the breakdown between meals
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
rooms and motar
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles so you'll see for 2020 to 2024
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
on average 80% of the revenue is from
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
meals 18% from rooms and then 2% from
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and I will note that
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rentals are only motor
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle rentals this doesn't include
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles ATVs boats anything like
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
that it's it's really just the the motor
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you're renting at a car um
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
Agent on page
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
23 this includes a breakdown of tax comp
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
components by
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
County so first at the top you will see
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
how M&amp;R kind of breaks down by county
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that the largest counties
 
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
are Rockingham Hillsboro and
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
marac at the bottom chart what you'll
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
see is for each County how the revenue
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
breaks down between meals rooms and
 
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
breaks down between meals rooms and
Motor

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
Motor
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so on the left hand side you'll
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
see straford and Rockingham straford is
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
92% of the revenue is from meals for
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
Rockingham it's
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
89% going to the other end to Carol and
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
coaz meals are only 66% and
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
54% but they have the highest rooms at
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
34% and 46%
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing to not is Hillsboro
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see by far has the largest motor
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle rentals and those are the car
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
rentals at the
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
airport the one thing I'll note before I
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
take questions on this is um over the
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
years there's been a lot of requests if
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
we can break down M&amp;R Revenue by
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
Town um and part of that I think is
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
driven from that 30% that goes back to
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that goes back based on
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
population um some folks have wondered
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether that should be returned based on
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of M&amp;R Revenue that's
 
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
generated in each town and long story
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
short we cannot provide the M&amp;R data by
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
town for a couple of reasons one we
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
allow for Consolidated filing so if you
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
own a number of Dunkin Donuts franchises
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
across the state or you own a restaurant
 
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
or a hotel that has multiple locations
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
you may you have to have a license for
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
every location but we allow you to pick
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
one of those licenses and file
 
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
one of those licenses and file
everything

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
together um also for some of our large
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
online travel companies that rent out a
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
lot of rooms or a lot of short-term
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
rentals they have a license for all of
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
their locations across the state but
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
that license typically has one address
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
on it cuz they're going to be a
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
Consolidated filer the other reason is
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
we get into cities and towns that maybe
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
have only two
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants and if we disclosed that
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
information for that town and you knew
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
what you were paying because you owned
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
one of those restaurants suddenly you
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
know exactly how much your competitor is
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
making so we cannot break M&amp;R down by
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
Town um the county level is kind of as
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
far down as we'll go
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
but I will note you know that some that
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
these numbers do have Consolidated
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
filings in it so they are probably a
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
little bit skewed to that extent but um
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
it's not as skewed as it would be if we
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
went down to the municipal level so
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on &amp;r
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
breakdown representative Opel thank you
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair again thank you commissioner um
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
just for clarification the um the tax on
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
rental cars or rental of
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles that
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
includes um if I rent a a truck from
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
Ryder to move some furniture that that
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be included in it yep and they
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
would collect that from you on your bill
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and remit it to us okay so that's an
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
example where if if somebody had three
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
or four Rider franchises one was in nsha
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
one was in Manchester and one was in
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
Lebanon yep it would be hard to they
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they would report it as a
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
Consolidated filer as one from one and
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
so so the only way we would be able to
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
get that breakdown is to then be able to
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
require it under
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
statute and that is a significant
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
undertaking um for those operators you
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
know filing Consolidated is much simpler
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
and easier for them especially because
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're filing on a monthly basis
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're filing 12 of these a year and if
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
you're a Consolidated filer with 25
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
locations 12 time 25 is not fun um in
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
terms of of the undertaking so um
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's no way to currently provide that
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
data based on the information that we
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
have the only way would be to have a
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislative change that would require it
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
and my apologies Mr chairman I think I
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
snuck a followup in there without sure
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
without requesting representative Spar
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh the 3% uh commission
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
that is there is that um what's the
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
intention or purpose of that and is that
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
typical uh among other states and sure
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so I think the
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
intention and the purpose there is that
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
they are kind of doing work on behalf of
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
the state um we also have a commission
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
with our real estate transfer tax for
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
the counties and we'll talk about that
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
in a minute but in the case of the
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
counties and then on the operators here
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
they're collecting the money on behalf
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
of the state um and then you know
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
remitting it on a monthly basis it is
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
common you will see commissions um in
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
other states for sales tax um or other
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
similar taxes to this there have been
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
conversations over the years about um is
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
3% the right number that's what it's
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
been for quite some time um and and
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
again the only way that they can retain
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
that commission is if they file and pay
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
on time so if you don't file and pay on
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
time um and if you don't file
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
electronically in most cases you're not
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to keep that commission
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
so the electronic filing and the
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
collection by The Operators um really
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
reduces the work that the state would
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you um on page 24 this
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
is just you know your your 10-year trend
 
01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
is just you know your your 10-year trend
of

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R what you can see between fiscal year
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
21 and fiscal year 22 is a
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
decline that is the result of the
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue transfer because this
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be just your general fund
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue so um and then the the increase
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
from 22 23 4 that is generally the trend
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
that we be we have been seeing um that
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R has been performing quite well but
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to call out what looks like
 
01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
a decline is a decline to the general
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
fund but not necessarily a decline in
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
tax

01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
tax again we talked through this a
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
little bit last week but we'll um cover
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
it again really the to the tobacco tax
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's kind of three taxes in
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
one you have your tax on a pack of
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
cigarettes which is $1.78 per pack of 20
 
01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:37.030 align:start position:0%
cigarettes which is $1.78 per pack of 20
or

01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
$223 for 25 cigarettes and that is tax
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
based on a stamp that's stuck on the
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
bottom of the
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
pack there's also a tax on other tobacco
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
products that are not ecigarettes this
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
would be your loose tobacco your chewing
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
tobacco Etc that is 65 5.03% of the
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
price and then we did have an ecigarette
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
tax go into effect on January 1st of
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
2020 and that is uh taxed differently
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
based on whether it's a closed system or
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
an open system so a Clos system would be
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
the ecigarette or vape that looks like a
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
pen everything's contained in one when
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
the liquid is gone you throw it out and
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
that is taxed on 30 cents per milliliter
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
on the volume of liquid that's contained
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
within the closed
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
system an open system is where you buy
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
typically just the liquid separately and
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
you have um a device that heats the
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
liquid um and you don't throw that
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
device out every
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
time that is taxed at 8% of the
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales price of the
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
liquid premium cigars are exempt from
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
Taxation and this is a tax upon the cons
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
consumer but pre-collected and paid by
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler although there's no
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.239 --> 01:35:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
case

01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
um when to file and pay so for
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
cigarettes that are sold in packages of
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 the wholesalers purchase rules
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
of stamps and affix them
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
to the product and they just come back
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
to us to buy more stamps when they need
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
them and for other tobacco products and
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
for ecigarettes then the wholesaler
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
report and pays that tax on a monthly
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
month on page 26 we have a question on
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
that uh yes represent thanks we have a
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
problem in that the ecigarettes
 
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
uh there are apparently an awful lot of
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
the ecigarettes like about 90% are
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
coming from China on container ships
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
which are not uh in
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
expected on their way in and so they do
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
not show up uh the
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
wholesalers that usually do the tobacco
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
products apparently are not uh acquiring
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
them or if they are they are illegally
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
requiring them and therefore they aren't
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
filing them and there is a bill in that
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
is trying to do something about this I'm
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
not sure the final version works very
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
well but I'm on it
 
01:36:24.119 --> 01:36:26.270 align:start position:0%
well but I'm on it
so

01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
on they they are the young people are
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
doing much more with ecigarettes than
 
01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.550 align:start position:0%
doing much more with ecigarettes than
they

01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
are with the older type and and the
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
older people seem to be moving towards
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
it too
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
so um correct we'll talk about the
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown between ecigarettes and U more
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
traditional products but if the first
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
part of your question was getting at how
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
does the department in Ure that tax is
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
paid I think that might have been where
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
you were going with that um so what we
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
do is we go into tobacco retailers and
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
we ask the retailer for copy of their
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
invoices from the wholesaler that shows
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
that tax has been paid if they don't
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
have an invoice showing that tax is paid
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
we seize the
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
product um and when that happens the
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
retailer then comes in for a hearing and
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to present
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
invoices that maybe their clerk couldn't
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
find at the time or whatever the case
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
may be we schedule a hearing they come
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
in they're allowed to present us with
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that the tax wasn't p
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
pa paid and if they can't then it's
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
considered contraband it's seized um and
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
we go through the process of attempting
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
to destroy it so we go into tobacco
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
retailers um and do tobacco retail
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
checks on a weekly basis um and when we
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
find product that we don't believe is
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
taxed we take it how one second how long
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
do you hold it until it's destroyed so
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
we've been holding some product for
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
quite some time but given the recent
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
increase in product um coming from China
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
and not going through the proper
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
holesale channels we've come across
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of product that um is
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
contraband and we are have essentially
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
ex exceeded our storage capability and
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
we are working before the end of the
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to destroy um the product
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
that we have on hand it's not easy um it
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
is hazardous waste um the lithium
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
batteries that are contained within the
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
ecigarette Clos systems and the liquid
 
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
is also hazardous so it's um it's a bit
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
of an undertaking and there's only
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
certain companies that are able to do
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
it repres elme yes s the followup on the
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
other allegation that was made was that
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
since it did not go through
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
inspection and since these come as open
 
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.550 align:start position:0%
inspection and since these come as open
system

01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
bottles on and they have no markings on
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
them even in Chinese that say what's in
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
them on is there any way to uh check
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
ingredients not necessarily so there's
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
I'll I guess I'll frame it this way
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
these products can be Contraband for one
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
of two reasons in my mind one is their
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
Contraband from the tax perspective in
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
that the tax has not been paid they also
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
can be considered contraband because
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
they're not on the FDA approved list of
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
ecigarette products so I'm not in charge
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
of enforcing the FDA approved cigarette
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
products I'm only looking at it from the
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
tax perspective but you're correct that
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's really two risks there
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of these products they may not
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
have the tax properly paid and they may
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
not have passed the fda's um requirement
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
for sale of these
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
products is does the FDA get it all
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
first so it all goes through the FDA
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
first no no some of it comes directly to
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yep okay
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
yep so some of these retailers can
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
purchase product directly from China um
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that's some of what we've seen and
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
so if it hasn't gone through a licensed
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
whor then it doesn't have the proper tax
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
paid on it and is also probably
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
Contraband from the fda's point of view
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
as well okay representative is that a
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
followup uh just a a final followup if I
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
or others put in a bill next year to
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
test some of this stuff before it's
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
destroyed would we be able to do that or
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
is this totally in the realm of
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
FDA which hasn't been moving very
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
quickly on this
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
stuff I don't know I I mean I don't know
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
the answer to
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
that directly
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
we we like I said we have the Contraband
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
from the tax perspective and the the FDA
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily know what we have um
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
because it's Contraband for tax purposes
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
and it was not seized as Contraband um
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
FDA I just like to add that it is not uh
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
in Chinese on these bottles apparently
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
China there probably questionable
 
01:41:43.119 --> 01:41:44.629 align:start position:0%
China there probably questionable
ingredients

01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
maybe uh okay we have a lot of questions
 
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
maybe uh okay we have a lot of questions
representative

01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
oing very good
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the product that is on the
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
FDA list that is confiscated for tax I
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
do not it seems to me we should be able
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
to make some money off of
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
that that thought has crossed my mind um
 
01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.149 align:start position:0%
that that thought has crossed my mind um
I

01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't I will say that's not the majority
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
of what we
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
have um typically the the products that
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
are on the
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
fda's approved list are from reputable
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
well-known manufacturers who understand
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
the supply chain and the product is
 
01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.030 align:start position:0%
the supply chain and the product is
properly

01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
taxed um the thought the other issue I
 
01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
guess with this is it's very expensive
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
to destroy this product um we're lucky
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we there we have found money in our
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
budget to do it it will require us to go
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
to both fiscal and GNC in order to move
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
money around to make the
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
payments um so I have thought
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
through you know it doesn't seem fair to
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
us that we're doing our job and we're
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
incurring you know $150,000 Bill to
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
destroy this product um but I just I
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
don't think any of these
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
retailers would have the funds to be
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
able to pay
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
it anyway I I don't know there's not a
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
good solution I guess is my point um and
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of some cases this product um much
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
expired um and not something that we
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
want back out uh for people to
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
consume follow up uh thank you Mr
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
chair specifically however if it's if
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's re sailable yep is there a
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism or can there be a mechanism
 
01:43:48.719 --> 01:43:49.950 align:start position:0%
mechanism or can there be a mechanism
within

01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
Dr as uh High does with their Surplus
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
so-called Surplus equipment sure um
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
there is the to dispose of salable
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
product sure there's currently no
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism but potentially as part of
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
bills that go through the process we
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
could think about um that as a solution
 
01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
I will just say there's nothing I can
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
say pretty confidently there is nothing
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we have right now that I would view
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
as salable okay quick follow okay quick
 
01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
if um if you see something where that
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate would you please
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
let uh us know thank you all right
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
represent op um thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
in this uh commissioner that my question
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
actually relates I think to something
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
that representative ol was getting at
 
01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.790 align:start position:0%
that representative ol was getting at
I'm

01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.390 align:start position:0%
I'm
wondering

01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
um what happens to a retailer or seller
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know if if if it happens one
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
time where they're selling
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
untaxed or even you know just they've
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
gone outside the system
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
um is you know what happens to that
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
seller and then I'm assuming if there's
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
more than one time that it occurs that
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that this may not be in the purview
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
of Dr but I'm assuming that it is in the
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
purview of the state you're correct so
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are um penalty Provisions within
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
the statute and then the ability to
 
01:45:24.589 --> 01:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately revoke a license if we see
 
01:45:24.599 --> 01:45:25.830 align:start position:0%
ultimately revoke a license if we see
repeat

01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
offenses and so fortunately um one time
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
is usually enough to teach them um and
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
so we don't knock on wood don't see a
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
ton of repeat offenders um but there are
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in statute to address
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
that follow up I'm I'm wondering in the
 
01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.310 align:start position:0%
that follow up I'm I'm wondering in the
case

01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
of that situation if there if that fee
 
01:45:52.239 --> 01:45:53.669 align:start position:0%
of that situation if there if that fee
or

01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
if if there's some relationship between
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
making them pay for the destruction or
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
or at least pay some
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
percentage I think that's something
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to think about
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
because it is it is so expensive but
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
it it's so cost prohibitive to them as
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
well that I think to your point we might
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to find the balance
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
there um there was a question over
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
here okay not
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
anymore okay okay I guess we're good
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um on page 26 this shows
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
you the breakdown
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes to other tobacco products
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
so cigarettes um from fiscal year 21 to
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
24 on average were 86% of the revenue
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
that was collected and other tobacco
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
14% page 27 shows you just the history
 
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
of just the tobacco tax stamp Revenue
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
um as Chris was alluding to earlier and
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
we have another slide coming up that
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
talks about other states um but you'll
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
see in fiscal year 20 to 21 that pretty
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the consumption
 
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes um that's really twofold
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
as Chris mentioned covid um isolation
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
and high anxiety times uh it's not
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
really conducive to reduced smoking um
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
so we saw an increase in usage during
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
that time um also there were bans of
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
certain products in other states which
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
drove people to New Hampshire to
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
purchase products that we had available
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
here that they couldn't purchase in
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
other states going from fiscal year 21
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
to 24 you do see that kind of declining
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
consumption um and declining Revenue
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
associated with tobacco tax stamps on
 
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
page 28 we show the history of other
 
01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:51.639 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so your traditional
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products your loose
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
tobacco chewing tobacco pipe tobacco
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to be in the blue and then
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes um starting with January 1
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
of 2020 are in that yellowish orange
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
color and so you can see that
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes um the revenue associated
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
with that has grown in the past few
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
years so we are seeing as representative
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
Aly mentioned that shift from the use of
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
more traditional um cigarettes to
 
01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.149 align:start position:0%
more traditional um cigarettes to
ecigarettes

01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the 10year trend on page
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
29 you can see leading into the pandemic
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
um and folks that were on the have been
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
on the committee for a while will
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
remember we saw a pretty consistent
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
year-over-year decline in the tobacco
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
tax that increased from 1920 into 21 due
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
to covid and the ban of products in
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
other states and then we're seeing a bit
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
of a reset back to um normal and Below
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
on page 30 I think we can answer a
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of the questions that have
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
been asked about tobacco tax rates in
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
other states and how that impacts the
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue that we see here so on
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
the leftand side you will see comparison
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
of tax rates for nearby States you will
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
see that we are ranked 26th in the
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
nation but we have surrounding states
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
such as New York Rhode Island
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Massachusetts and burm that
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
10 on the right you will see a ranking
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
um for smuggled cigarettes consumed as a
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
percent of total cigarettes consumed so
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is basically saying we are first in
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
for um cigarettes that are purchased
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
state so that contributes to the revenue
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
um that we see and if you were to
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
actually take the number of cigarettes
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we essentially sell every year and
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
try to look at that on a per capita
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
basis for New Hampshire we'd probably
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
all be long gone there's no way we could
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
consume all of those so most of most of
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
what's purchased here is um consumed out
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
of state all right representative boards
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner so the uh forbidden
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
products in other states I guess would
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
be like menthol cigarettes and that type
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
of thing correct so other states have
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
banned um menthol cigarettes flavored
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
product flavored ecigarettes um and so
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
that has d uh driven those folks to New
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least initially to purchase
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
their product they may find other ways
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
to purchase it such as over the Internet
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
um Etc but at least initially when those
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
bands go into effect we see a bump um in
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
in our Revenue here okay thank you
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
followup and so
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to increase the tax on
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
cigarettes you know pack of 20 whatever
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
from Buck 78 to uh I think I read
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
something recently possibly 278 a pack
 
01:51:13.629 --> 01:51:13.639 align:start position:0%
how might that influence what I'm seeing
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
here for New Jersey and Maine I mean are
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
we looking at a potential loss of
 
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue so I think it would be a balance
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
between the additional Revenue by the
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
higher tax rate balanced with the
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
potential reduction in the purchase of
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
cigarettes from out of state consumers
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
here and it it would be kind of the
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
balance between the two I don't know
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
that it would immediately result in a
 
01:51:37.159 --> 01:51:38.870 align:start position:0%
that it would immediately result in a
decrease

01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
um even if we went to what was above um
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
you know Maine or New Jersey just
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
because of that additional dollar so it
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
it would just be the
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
balance thank you and if I can just
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
clarify I did misspeak slightly we're
 
01:51:58.830 --> 01:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
not the first state we're the fifth
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
state so um when you look at the
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
rankings on the right New Hampshire is
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
45th presumably out of 50 representative
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
om yeah thank you do you have any uh
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
data commissioner on the per capita uh
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
use of tobacco some national rates that
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
we can look at for Trends we could we
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
can get that information um I think
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's some additional information in
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
this report that by the tax Foundation
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's called cigarette taxes and
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
cigarette smuggling um by state we can
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
we can get that report to you um and
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
kind of pull out some highlights from it
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of per capita um usage and that
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
thing okay if no more questions we'll
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
head on to the Rett tax okay so real
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax again we talked
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
about this last week and I know you
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
heard from a lot of folks during the
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
year economic two days of economic
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
briefings about the housing market um so
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
I won't totally beat a dead horse but
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully just provide a little bit more
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
context um so this is a tax on the sale
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
granting in transfer of real property or
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
interest in Real Property the tax is
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
imposed on both the buyer and the seller
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
at a rate of 75 cents per $100 of the
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
price or consideration of the sale as I
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um this is essentially
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
paid by buying stamps which are affixed
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
to the deed and that is done from the
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
register of deeds in the county where
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
the property is located for doing that
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
work um the register of deeds retains 4%
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
of the face value of the stamps that are
 
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
sold in the
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
county each buyer and seller file a
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
declaration of consideration and an
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
inventory property transfer within 30
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
days each register shall remit the taxes
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
collected to the department on a monthly
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
basis typically on the 10th so by the
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
15th or so we usually have the majority
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
of our um real estate transfer tax
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
revenue um in the door the only
 
01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
exception to that is real estate holding
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
company transactions those don't go
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
through the county those are um reported
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the Dr and paid to the Dr um directly
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
so when you have a change in the amount
 
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
of um in a real real estate holding
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
company transactions those come directly
 
01:54:18.239 --> 01:54:19.149 align:start position:0%
company transactions those come directly
to

01:54:19.149 --> 01:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
us and we watch for those on a monthly
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
basis and we will note in the revenue
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
Focus if there's significant real estate
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
holding company transactions um so that
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
you understand um that it's different
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.069 --> 01:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
transactions um looking at fiscal year
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
2024 share of total transactions and
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
total revenue you will see that the
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the transactions occur in
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and Rockingham County and they
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
also have the majority of the revenue no
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
real surprise there but just so folks
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
could so that you could see um the
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
activity in each of your counties I
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
thought would be
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
helpful and then on page 33 looking at
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
the 10year
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
trend um you'll see from 2015 to 2020 we
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
were pretty consistent um year of a year
 
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
increase obviously um the interest in
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
buying homes in New Hampshire um during
 
01:55:19.629 --> 01:55:19.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so 20 to 21 and 21 to 22
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
increases I would note that in 2021
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
209.000 that was a new high since 2025
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
um but the inventory isn't there and the
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
sales aren't happening um we are seeing
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
a bit of a recovery in
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
2025 so I think we you know will kind of
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
level out here um but again in 2024 even
 
01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
at 183.2 million you know that's almost
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
30 million more or more than 30 million
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
more than where we were in 2019 so we
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
just had a really great couple years of
 
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
R and now it's kind of right sizing a
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
bit Yeah r pres ol was just uh pointing
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
out that if we draw a line is that what
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to say no I from 2020 to
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
2024 it's a continue up the slope is
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
very consistent so if you throw out the
 
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
excess data of 20 uh
 
01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
2122 it's interesting yes agreed do you
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
have any uh uh information from either
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
Realtors or the uh uh 10 counties or 11
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
act no 10 counties um
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
Registries regarding the number of refid
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
that are taking place or you know the uh
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
the extensions the subprime tent
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
occasionally offers if you can't make
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
this payment we're just going to roll it
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
on to the end of your term of your
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage so that a 30-year mortgage
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
becomes a 35 40 45 50e mortgage do you
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
have any of that data around I don't at
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
the moment it's something that we
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
possibly could look into because that
 
01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
possibly could look into because that
would

01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
certainly potential or would influence a
 
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner's decision about if and when
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
they might want to sell their home right
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
if um if they're having trouble making
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
payments um you know maybe they would
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know want a downsize if they can
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
even afford to do that you know or the
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
price that they'd be looking to sell
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
their home would need to um cover the
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
The increased mortgage um or increased
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
time for which they are making payments
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
on that mortgage representative follow
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you yes I I understand that
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
that it as I was reminded it does not
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
affect R but it does affect
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
bankruptcies uh and with the strict
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy laws that we have now as
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to two decades
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
ago does this affect the ability of a
 
01:58:25.069 --> 01:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
consumer to purchase a property I think
 
01:58:25.079 --> 01:58:25.870 align:start position:0%
consumer to purchase a property I think
the

01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
biggest um difficulty is just the
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
properties need to be up for sale I I
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's an inventory I
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
think in the first case it's an
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
inventory problem and in the second case
 
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's an affordability problem and I
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty consistent with what
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
you heard last week that's what that's
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
at least what we're seeing from the data
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at thank you okay
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
sure okay okay we are going to very
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
quickly walk through the interest and
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
dividends tax just because I wanted to
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
be thorough um and there will be um
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is revenue from indd in 25 and we
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
will come to you with an estimate for a
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
small amount of indd Revenue in 26 and
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
even a smaller amount in 27 so because
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
we will have a little bit of Revenue I
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure everyone was
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
aware of what the IND is so the IND has
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
been repealed um effective January 1st
 
01:59:22.719 --> 01:59:23.910 align:start position:0%
been repealed um effective January 1st
of

01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
2025 um we are in the process starting
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
today of mailing out 90,000 letters um
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
making sure folks know that the tax is
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
repealed that they need to file their
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
final or the their return for 2024
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to be due in April but they
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
should not be making estimated payments
 
01:59:41.599 --> 01:59:42.950 align:start position:0%
should not be making estimated payments
for

01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
2025 um so we're doing our best to
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
communicate all of that so that we don't
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
collect any money that is not due to the
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
state U I have a question on that point
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
I mean is is it necessary to send all
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
those out because when someone goes to
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
file 2025 there won't be a
 
02:00:01.690 --> 02:00:01.700 align:start position:0%
form but you would you would think
 
02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:04.030 align:start position:0%
form but you would you would think
[Laughter]

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
that that assumes that one would want to
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
use the correct form um that doesn't
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
always happen um so certainly you know
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
anybody utilizing a CPA or an an
 
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
accountant um or an enrolled agent to
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
prepare their taxes they're very well
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
aware we have not produced 2025 forms we
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
have various internal processes in place
 
02:00:31.030 --> 02:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
um to do our very best to not cash that
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
check if it is for a 2025 indd estimated
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
payment uh we have letters ready to go
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
to send it right back to you we're not
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
even going to cash it um some of that
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
will get cash um uh or payments will be
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
made because people do have the ability
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
to just kind of make a payment to us
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
because we are charged with collecting
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
money and we don't want to make it too
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for you to to make a payment
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
um but we're trying to do our best to
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't collect money
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
that is would be due for 2025 that makes
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
sense but it made me think if somebody
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
is paying and they don't put on their
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
check what quarter it's for y then you
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
you have a conundrum most too correct
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
yeah correct and you know we are all
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
creatures of habit and we are all um
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
overstimulated on a daily basis and so
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
folks are just in the habit of making
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
that you make that return payment in
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
April and you send your estimate payment
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
right along with it um and so we're just
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing our very best to make sure people
 
02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
doing our very best to make sure people
are

02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
aware um the threshold for the interest
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax was
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
$2,400 a year or 4,800 for joint filers
 
02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
and there was also an exemption for
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
residents that were 65 or older blind or
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
disabled before their 65th birthday the
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
timing follows very similarly with um
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
your personal income tax at a federal
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
level so returns are due April 15th
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
there is an automatic extension to file
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
but not to pay and quarterly estimates
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
are due April 15th June 15th September
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
15th and January 15th so I will not that
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
is why we did not send out the letters
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
until starting today because there is an
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
estimated payment that is due January
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
15th that is still due even though the
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
tax is repealed because that estimated
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
payment is final payment for the prior
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
year so we did want to limit
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
confusion as much as we
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
can sounds good um on page 35 just a
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
breakdown of indd indd is primarily paid
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
by individuals and Joint
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
filers and distributions in tax year 22
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
made up the largest portion um of the
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
tax but interestingly on page
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
36 we kind of went back 10 years years
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
and showed the breakdown between
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
distributions dividends federally tax
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
exempt interest income and interest and
 
02:03:04.589 --> 02:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see especially in 2023 that's a
 
02:03:07.069 --> 02:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
pretty large portion in green so that
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
interest income is a result of the
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates that we've seen um
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
so a good portion of the growth in indd
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
in tax year 2023 is due to increased
 
02:03:17.079 --> 02:03:18.950 align:start position:0%
in tax year 2023 is due to increased
interest

02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
rates on page 37 just looking at the
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
10-year Trend again we've seen pretty
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
significant growth in the past um year
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
or so as interest rates have
 
02:03:30.719 --> 02:03:34.430 align:start position:0%
or so as interest rates have
increased

02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
um but this is repealed so we'll have
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
some some lingering money as um people
 
02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
do not always pay on time we do still
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
have audit and collection Authority and
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
so we will make sure that the tax is
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
fully wrapped up so there will be some
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue that does come in in fiscal
 
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
on page 38 moving on to communication
 
02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:58.589 align:start position:0%
on page 38 moving on to communication
Services

02:03:58.589 --> 02:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
tax again we talked about this last week
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
Communications Communication service
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
providers are responsible for collecting
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
and remitting the tax so this would be
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
tacked on to your cell phone bill this
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
is um comes in on the 15th of every
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
month looking at the 10-year trend on
 
02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:23.149 align:start position:0%
month looking at the 10-year trend on
page

02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
39 we've seen a decrease in CST over the
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
past 10 years that's really due to a
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
couple of things first fewer landlines
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
for a while folks had a landline and a
 
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
cell phone now many people have given up
 
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.390 align:start position:0%
cell phone now many people have given up
those

02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
landlines and then as we talked about
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
last week kind of modern pricing on your
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
cell phone bill um the tax is on two-way
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
Communications but not on internet
 
02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
Communications but not on internet
access

02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
so as more and more of your cell phone
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill is attributed attributed to data
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
and your use of surfing the web checking
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
your email that's going to decrease the
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
CST where we have seen a bit of an
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
increase is in um the use of VoIP and
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
video conferencing coming out of the
 
02:05:14.189 --> 02:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic um that is taxable and so we've
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
seen some increase
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that kind of wraps up we've got
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
a number of slides to go but um that
 
02:05:31.549 --> 02:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
wraps up basically the larger taxes that
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to be um
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
estimating I have a couple of quick
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
slides on the Medicaid enhancement tax
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then the nursing facility quality
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
assessment so these are not going to be
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues these are going to
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
be um dedicated funds or restricted
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
revenues so the first um is a Medicaid
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax and that's
 
02:05:58.990 --> 02:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
5.4% on net patient services revenues um
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
of hospitals the taxes paid by General
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
hospitals that provide both inpatient
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
and outpatient
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
services and the Met has a little bit of
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
a funky um tax period it's for the
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
12-month period beginning July 1 and
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
ending June 30 and the tax is based on
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
the F Hospital's fiscal year end
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
that occurred within the calendar year
 
02:06:26.669 --> 02:06:26.679 align:start position:0%
end of that taxable
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
period it's
 
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
complicated I have to draw it out every
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
time what it really means is there's a
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
bit of delay probably even more
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
pronounced than what we see with
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
business taxes between the revenues of
 
02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
the hospital and it being reflected in
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
met Revenue so each hospital has to file
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
a non-binding estimate honored before
 
02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:49.709 align:start position:0%
a non-binding estimate honored before
January

02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
January
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
15th so I can tell you for this year
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
which will be for the taxable period
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
ending June 30
 
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
2025 we received non-binding estimates
 
02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:03.750 align:start position:0%
2025 we received non-binding estimates
of

02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.390 align:start position:0%
of
$348.00

02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
$348.00
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
million the budget assumed
 
02:07:10.679 --> 02:07:12.709 align:start position:0%
million the budget assumed
$276.5

02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
$276.5
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
million so the estimates non-binding
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
estimates were
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
348.50 and the operating budget assumed
 
02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:56.030 align:start position:0%
348.50 and the operating budget assumed
276.50

02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
two questions yeah you you go further on
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
and say this goes into the uncompensated
 
02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's to pay for Littleton and and the
 
02:08:08.549 --> 02:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
smaller hospitals sure that require
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
assistance for their Emergency
 
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
Services yeah so we'll talk uh I
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but in a couple slides
 
02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
the hospital Corporation is paying this
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
on each patient
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
Bill the hospital is paying this on on
 
02:08:29.709 --> 02:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
what is deemed net Patient Service
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.549 --> 02:08:39.559 align:start position:0%
statute and so there's deductions for
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care there's a deductions
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
for charity care Etc so it's basically
 
02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay the difference
 
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
between uncompensated pay and charity
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
pay um so they'll that that's why it's
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
net Patient Service Revenue so it's it's
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
really a tax on the actual money that
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
they've received so it's a business
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
profits tax on a
 
02:09:00.719 --> 02:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
profits tax on a
nonprofit

02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
sure um looking at the 10year trend of
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
met on page 41 um it generally has
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
increased um the slope there is pretty
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
consistent with the exception of 20 to
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
21 and this is when a lot of outpatient
 
02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
services were not happening during covid
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
so if you kind of ignore that little
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
blip that slope is pretty
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
consistent in terms of our role um as
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
representative ery was mentioned so they
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
file their non um binding estimated
 
02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:39.639 align:start position:0%
payment with us we notify um DHHS of
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
that amount I'm going to do that this
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then the hospitals will
 
02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
pay um their met to us on January 15 or
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me April 15th the Met is then
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
deposit ited directly into the
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and Medicaid fund
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
that is established in statute and then
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of HHS is responsible
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
for Distributing that those funds in
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
accordance um with disproportionate
 
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
share Hospital payments or dish payments
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
is sometimes how you may hear them
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
referred to in other um Medicaid
 
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures and then it is up to Dr to
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
audit those returns and collect any
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
additional met that's owed yes we have
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
another question repres all okay you're
 
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
up you're auditing the returns from the
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals to to yourself correct who
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
audits the disposition of the
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
funds that would likely distribution of
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the distribution of the funds that would
 
02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.589 align:start position:0%
the distribution of the funds that would
likely

02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
likely
 
02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
um fall to um either the LBA or the
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
Auditors um the state's external
 
02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:50.559 align:start position:0%
Auditors that that money was spent spent
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately Accord the statute thank
 
02:10:56.830 --> 02:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
you have another question represent Aly
 
02:10:59.790 --> 02:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
can I have a comment you may as long as
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's okay not too long
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
on this uh medic Medicaid um enhancement
 
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh used to be called medas scam we when
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
I came in we were not allowed to use
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
that that name outside of a closed room
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh but the feds caught up with it about
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
after about 15 years I forget exactly
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
when uh and imposed regulations and then
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
imposed more regulations and that's
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
what's in our statutes that they have to
 
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.669 align:start position:0%
what's in our statutes that they have to
abide

02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
by okay I think we can continue okay
 
02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um the next three pages 43 44
 
02:11:52.109 --> 02:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
and 45 are for the nurs in facility
 
02:11:52.119 --> 02:11:53.149 align:start position:0%
and 45 are for the nurs in facility
quality

02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
quality
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
assessment think met but for nursing
 
02:11:59.310 --> 02:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
homes very similar operates in a very
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
similar way so I won't go into too much
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
detail um on page
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
44 you'll see pretty significant
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
increase in NF QA from 22 23
 
02:12:13.950 --> 02:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
24 this is probably going to Trend in
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
that direction we have an aging
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire higher
 
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
utilization of nursing homes means more
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
NF QA
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then on page 45 similar to met this
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
is going to be um money that's directly
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
deposited into the nursing facility
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund and it's the responsibility
 
02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of DHHS to expend
 
02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:40.669 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of DHHS to expend
those

02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
funds you have another question yes
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
Robi I just a quick uh look from 2015 to
 
02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
Robi I just a quick uh look from 2015 to
uh

02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
2024 that's pretty watch uh a straight
 
02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
line uh why the outlayer with the
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
23 are you looking at NF QA nqa Revenue
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing it kind of go up and down you
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
drew a straighter line than I did I drew
 
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
a straight
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
line um this will just again fluctuate
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
by um utilization of nursing homes so
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
like 20 to 21 to 22 you see that go down
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
a bit this is where you're also going to
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
have potential with um covid with
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
patients being hit harder in nursing
 
02:13:35.229 --> 02:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
homes than other places also um the
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
ability to staff facilities you know to
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
a level where you can have increased
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
number of patients it all kind of goes
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
together that make sense that's fair
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent El me this is a
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
question uh is um our our Assisted
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
Living places included in
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
this so this is going to be um nursing
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
facilities as well as facilities
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
licensed as specialty hos hospital and
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
certified to receive federal
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as a nursing facility so I
 
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
know we have a variety
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
of um living facilities and this is not
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
my area of expertise but the definition
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
in the statute is essentially if if
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
you're certified to receive federal
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as a nursing facility then
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
you would be subject to the nursing
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
facility quality assessment thank
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
you okay okay page 46 utility property
 
02:14:40.589 --> 02:14:40.599 align:start position:0%
tax so this again we talked about a bit
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
last week we got a couple of questions
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um so this is a tax on utility property
 
02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:48.069 align:start position:0%
um so this is a tax on utility property
at

02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
$660 per thousand of value the Dr sets
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
the values as of December 1st and that's
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
based on um the value from the previous
 
02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.149 align:start position:0%
based on um the value from the previous
April

02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
first utility property taxpayers will um
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
make estimated payments to us and then
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
any amount that is Due based on their um
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
new assessment on December 1st that is
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
due to us by January
 
02:15:20.589 --> 02:15:20.599 align:start position:0%
15th on page 47 you can see some slight
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
Vari in the tax although we've been
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
between essentially 40 um and 47 million
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
over the past few years here um and this
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
is driven by the number of properties
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
that qualify as utility property and how
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
they are generally
 
02:15:43.149 --> 02:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
performing um in terms of uh their
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
profitability I have a quick question
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
does the do the towns get any tax or is
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
this totally just a only state only the
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
state can tax the utilities this is the
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
state's assessment on these utilities
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
the town will tax this the towns and
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities will tax this property as
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
well okay um and so it is taxed at the
 
02:16:04.510 --> 02:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
state level it goes the money goes
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
directly into the education trust fund
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then these properties are not
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
subject to the Statewide education
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
property tax or the swept so looking at
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know my residential property um in
 
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
the town that I live in I am going to
 
02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
pay the swept and I'm going to pay my
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
local property tax for these Utilities
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
in my same town they're going to pay a
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
local property tax and they're going to
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
pay the upt essentially in lie of the
 
02:16:38.429 --> 02:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
swept so they wouldn't pay the
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
swept yes
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
represent speculation pending
 
02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:47.559 align:start position:0%
legislation yes generators yes are
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
currently paying the upt correct so if
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
the pending legislation uh goes
 
02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
forward their contribution to this will
 
02:16:59.709 --> 02:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
be reduced but it will be be picked up
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
correct if they become exempt from the
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
upt whatever um they're paying in will
 
02:17:13.309 --> 02:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
come out of this
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
tax that will then make them subject to
 
02:17:19.389 --> 02:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
the swept and they will then contribute
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
to the 363 3 million statutory amount of
 
02:17:29.549 --> 02:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
swept there unless there is a specific
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
addition to the swept of the amount that
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
they paid in upt it won't necessarily be
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
made up
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
elsewhere well yeah but they'll be
 
02:17:41.309 --> 02:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
contributing to the swept which will be
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
lowering the swept for everybody
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
else makes sense thank you ma'am
 
02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
else makes sense thank you ma'am
represent

02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
elme just a clarification are we talking
 
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
about those little itty bitty generators
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
that no we're talk dams dams we're
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
talking about power large power
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
generators right not your little home
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay we're gonna go through the next
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
couple of slides pretty quickly it's not
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue that you need to estimate it's
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
just falls under dr's purview um the
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
first is the railroad tax it um
 
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
generates less than
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year relatively small but Dr
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
um determines the value and is taxed
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat similarly to
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
upt on page 49 we have local property
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
taxes so this is where I was just
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
swept the Statewide education property
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
tax the department is charged with
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
setting the swept rate for each
 
02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
municipality so that the state generates
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
um a minimum of $363 million every year
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
we do that by rounding to the nearest
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
half cent so that um even with that
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
rounding we generate slightly more than
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
the 363 just because of
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
rounding Dr also oversees local property
 
02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
taxes so we set the rates the local
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
rates in all of the
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so we set the local
 
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
rate the school rate the county rate and
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
the swept rate so you have us to thank
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
for your local property tax bill as well
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes we have a question re
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
Elber um I'm a little confused here I
 
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
thought that in Nashua the property tax
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
rate is set by the board of
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
alderman we they set the
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
spend and then we set the actual rate so
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
we do the math between the total value
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the town and the total spend we put
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
together when you're going to be the
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
unpopular tax collector you might as
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
well just do it
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
all yes representative yeah but that's
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
the swept is separate from
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
the correct so we set the swept warrant
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
we tell the towns what they need to
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
collect in swept and then we set the
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
other rates based on the spend um and
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
the valuation that the town provides to
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
us so the town follow up so again the
 
02:20:27.070 --> 02:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
towns or cities municipalities set their
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
own they they right they they provide us
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
with the values and they provide us with
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.710 --> 02:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
scam the swept is
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
virtual uh it's included in your tax
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
your property local property tax bill on
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
when you pay it you pay the swept
 
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
yourself it's not coming from the state
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
the state never sees it correct the
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
swept is um paid by property owners and
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
on your tax bill and it is retained
 
02:21:14.910 --> 02:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
locally so rather than the
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities sending that money to the
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
state and then sending it back to the
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities it is is currently um
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
retained at the municipal level there
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
are numerous bills that address the
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
swept this session
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay okay two other local taxes that
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
Dr um helps to administer is the gravel
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
tax and the timber tax also referred to
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
as Sticks and Stones within
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
Dr um so gravel tax there is a 2 cent
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
per cubic yard of
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Earth when it's excavated it is taxable
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
we help the municipalities administer
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we have a gravel expert on staff
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
there is also a Timber tax where the tax
 
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
rate is 10% of the stumpage value at the
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
time of cutting again assessed and
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
payable to the local assessing officials
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
but we have some Tree Experts and
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
logging experts on staff that assist the
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities with doing that
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
on page 52 this is similar chart that I
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
provided last week but just gives you a
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the timing of revenues that
 
02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:32.230 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the timing of revenues that
Dr

02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
collects so I think the easiest thing is
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
to go all the way to the bottom which
 
02:22:38.429 --> 02:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
looks at the breakdown between the first
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
half of the year and the second half of
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
the year so at this point we have
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
revenues through
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
December so half the year is over so for
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
business taxes over the 2014 to 2024
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
period history has tell told us that
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
we've collected 43% of the revenue for
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the year and that 57% of the revenue is
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
going to come in between January and
 
02:23:05.469 --> 02:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
June why is the second half of the year
 
02:23:07.389 --> 02:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
more we still have two estimated
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
payments in the second half like the
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
first half but we also have all of those
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
return and extension payments in March
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
and April so more than half of the
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
revenue is still to come for business
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
for M&amp;R we've probably already collected
 
02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
more than half of the revenue
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the best months for um M&amp;R revenue is
 
02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
really July August September October
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
those nice summer months coming into the
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
fall M&amp;R Trails off a bit in the winter
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
mud season's tough um so we've probably
 
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
seen more than half of M&amp;R come in so
 
02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
far this year tobacco split just about
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
5050 indd again it's been repealed but
 
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
this is one I just like to
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
highlight um where that estimated
 
02:23:53.349 --> 02:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
payment is not made until January that
 
02:23:55.389 --> 02:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
final estimated payment you have the
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
vast majority of your revenue for for
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
indd collected in the second half of the
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
year and then lastly for r r kind of
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
looks similar to M&amp;R we have probably
 
02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
already collected more than half of R
 
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the year those same nice June July
 
02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
or July August September October those
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
are nice months um for home buying and
 
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
selling as well and we go into a bit of
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
on page 53 is just a list of resources
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
if you're dying for more information you
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
can always call me um or if you're
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
having trouble
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
sleeping um our annual report is
 
02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
available on our website we have a
 
02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
transparency page which has some nice
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
graphs and statistics we provide daily
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
revenue updates a tax expenditure report
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
and you can always sign up for our list
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
serve to get all of the great news that
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to take a couple minutes to
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a preview for the
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
next time that you see us um with
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
respect to revenues you'll see us for
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
bills but the next time you see us with
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
respect to revenues we'll actually be
 
02:25:06.910 --> 02:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
working with Chris to do Revenue
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
estimates and so the way that we do this
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
is we
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
typically estimate where we believe the
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year will end so where
 
02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
will fiscal year 25 end
 
02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then we look at what the growth
 
02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
rates will be from 25 to 26 and then 26
 
02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:28.230 align:start position:0%
rates will be from 25 to 26 and then 26
to

02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
27 so 26 and 27 we're only going to talk
 
02:25:31.439 --> 02:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
27 so 26 and 27 we're only going to talk
growth

02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
growth
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
rates where we need to make the decision
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
is where 25 is going to end and the way
 
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
that we do that is we run a few
 
02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
that we do that is we run a few
different

02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
scenarios namely five we look at what
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 plan is for each tax type
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
we look at the sustaining percent versus
 
02:25:55.950 --> 02:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
plan so if the first 6 months of the
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
year we were 5% ahead of plan let's
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
assume we remain 5% ahead of plan for
 
02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year where does that get
 
02:26:06.269 --> 02:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
us then we do the same thing but we
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
compare it to Prior year so if we're 10%
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
ahead of Prior year let's assume we
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
remain 10% ahead of Prior year for the
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
year then our last two scenarios is we
 
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
take year-to date and we say let's just
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
say we equal plan for the rest of the
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
year and then let's take year to date
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
and say let's just say we equal prior
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
year for the rest of the year so we put
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
all of these five scenarios together and
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
what we'll do for you is we'll kind of
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
hone all of those into a high low range
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
so for instance if plan if we are
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
outperforming plan we're not even going
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
to give you that as one of the scenarios
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it's just not realistic so we'll
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
kind of give you a realist sck high and
 
02:26:53.469 --> 02:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
low for where we think 25 is going to
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
end and then we'll give you a high and
 
02:26:58.349 --> 02:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
low for 26 for growth rates and a high
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and low for
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
27 as Chris mentioned we don't need to
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
account for pending legislation that
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
will be done with within the Surplus
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
statement and then we will talk about
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
any impact of current law although I
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a lot that we'll
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
really need to address there most of the
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
changes are already in a effect and I
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't other than the repeal of indd I
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of impacts of any
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
current law that we haven't already felt
 
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
but we'll walk through that with you if
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are any at the time that we do
 
02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:35.950 align:start position:0%
there are any at the time that we do
Revenue

02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
estimates and then lastly in the P last
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
couple minutes um Chris mentioned rims
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
as part of um his discussion earlier so
 
02:27:47.469 --> 02:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
folks that are new to the committee I
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give everybody kind of an
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
overview you'll hear us talk about rims
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
um so rims was a big deal um it is our
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue information management system Dr
 
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
received a
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
$3,160 th000 capital appropriation in
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
order to replace our existing Tims
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
system which stood for tax information
 
02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:11.950 align:start position:0%
system which stood for tax information
management

02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
system uh Tims was implemented in 1990
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
it was obsolete it was a um Cobalt
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
system so if you think black black
 
02:28:23.309 --> 02:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
background green flashing cursor I
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
remember my first day at Dr I put my
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
hand on The Mouse and the person that
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
was training me was like Oh no you're
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
not going to need that um lots of
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
function keys lots of tabbing between
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
Fields um so Tims was great but it had
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
so maybe a decade before yes um so it
 
02:28:49.389 --> 02:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
had reached its life not only in terms
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
of function ity but also there were
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
security concerns coming into the the
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
age that we're in um so we really needed
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
a new upgraded system and so that's rims
 
02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
so rims is used not only by us at Dr but
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
also by tax practitioners and
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we have um an outward facing
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
portal called Granite tax connect which
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'll show you in a minute um it really
 
02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
revolutionized everything that we did um
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
so it was implemented by Dr in
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
partnership with our DOI it counterparts
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
fast Enterprises was the vendor that was
 
02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
selected and we implemented their
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
commercial off-the-shelf software called
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
gen tax um the vast majority of states
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the US use gen tax so it is a very um
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
powerful Tax Administration software um
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
fast primarily um implements Tax
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
Administration software so they're
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
really the experts in the area it has
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
served us very well Implement
 
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
implementation consisted of three phases
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
which took about a year each um and the
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
total contract for that um was just over
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
29 million what you will see on page 56
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
is the rollouts we were on time and on
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
budget for the implementation of rims
 
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
even during the middle of a global
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic so we're very proud of that and
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
I brag about it every chance that I get
 
02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
on page 57 this is a snapshot of the
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
current Granite tax
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
connect um a few things that I want to
 
02:30:29.429 --> 02:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
call your attention to this is obviously
 
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
where you would go to file and pay your
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
taxes as a taxpayer or as a tax
 
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner but there are things you
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
can do on here that you don't need to
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
have an account for um the first is
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
under taxpayer reference which is the
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
second box down on the left um you can
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
request a form to be mailed to you not a
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
2025 indd estimate because we won't send
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
it but you could request other forms to
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
be mailed to you um if you had received
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
a tax notice from us under businesses
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
and individuals you could submit an
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
appeal request right through GTC that
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
has been um very helpful for both us and
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and then lastly on the bottom
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
right Under reporting the first um
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
bullet there says look up a meals and
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
rentals tax license so if you're ever
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if that restaurant in that in
 
02:31:20.269 --> 02:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
your town has an M&amp;R license you can
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
look it up right there and if they don't
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
out you can do that
 
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
anonymously um representative elme has a
 
02:31:35.230 --> 02:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
question Follow by
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative are you sure about 1990
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
because in 1990 the whole state had
 
02:31:43.389 --> 02:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
practically no
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
computerization I believe that's when
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
the development of Tims came in that we
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
began developing it um around 1990 it
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
was a homegrown system it was developed
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
here um and like I said served us well
 
02:31:59.309 --> 02:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
but did not contain all of our tax types
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and so we had a number of disparate
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
systems and so rims modernized and
 
02:32:04.990 --> 02:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
brought everything together that
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
consisted of three desktop computers
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
that were already
 
02:32:16.269 --> 02:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
old on that were being pumped in by
 
02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in the Dr taking
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
terms 1990 was the date that I was given
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
um I was eight at the time so I'd have
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
to go by what I was well I was
 
02:32:33.550 --> 02:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
new radio sha
 
02:32:36.269 --> 02:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
trs8 I've got a we have two more
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh I want to be mindful of the
 
02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
time it's 12:30 representative om yeah
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for an excellent presentation
 
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh I ask a favor of you the C the clerk
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
would like to keep this as a personal
 
02:32:49.469 --> 02:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
copy would you have an extra one for the
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
it okay representative
 
02:32:59.269 --> 02:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
Brier I just wanted to comment in 1990 I
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
actually uh did an audit over at Revenue
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
Administration and uh they had just put
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
it in put it in okay okay good confirmed
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I've been waiting 45 minutes to
 
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:15.640 align:start position:0%
ask this question since since
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aly brought it
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
up all right on page 14 and page 19
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
okay back when representative major was
 
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
chair and represent Al's ranking
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
member they tried to get a study done to
 
02:33:35.309 --> 02:33:35.319 align:start position:0%
collect data now this is the question it
 
02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't it wasn't approved because
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to rush into this on
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
page 14 those one at the bottom of the
 
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
triangle there
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
1,152 companies that paid an estimated
 
02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
62 1 million in business profits
 
02:33:57.269 --> 02:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
tax if they had sold every product out
 
02:34:00.429 --> 02:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
the door out of the
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
state what would have been their
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
business profits tax that they would
 
02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
have owed the state if all their sales
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
went out after they've done their cost
 
02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:12.309 align:start position:0%
went out after they've done their cost
analysis

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
and probably very little very little so
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
that means we could have lost or could
 
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
lose theoretically 620 $1
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
million in
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue well
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
because that's just a the theoretical
 
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
question I just want to hear you say you
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
could lose you could okay thank
 
02:34:36.110 --> 02:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
you um and it's good gain and you could
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
gain it all right it's all looking to
 
02:34:43.710 --> 02:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
the customer um okay I just very quickly
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
there is two more slides that are very
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
quick that actually um is less of me
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
bragging about rims although there's a
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of bragging but it actually
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
does matter a little bit for Revenue
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
estimating purposes so on page 52 this
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a lot of words but this basically is
 
02:35:01.359 --> 02:35:02.550 align:start position:0%
is a lot of words but this basically is
saying

02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that part of The Debt
 
02:35:09.630 --> 02:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
Service um for the bonds that were
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
issued in order for Dr to pay almost $30
 
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
million for a new system part of those
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
bonds the principal and interest needs
 
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
to be paid by Revenue uplift so the
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
Assumption was that rims would generate
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue we would have more Revenue under
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
a modern system and so the way that that
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
happens is every year every fiscal year
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
up to $4 million of general fund revenue
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
is transferred out into a dedicated fund
 
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
to pay that Rim's Debt Service and so
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
what you'll see see on page 59 is the
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
history of those transfers
 
02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 20 our we were not
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
fully up and running so we didn't
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
transfer anything in 21 we were
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
partially underway so we transferred 2.2
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
million and then 22 23 and 24 we've
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
reached the 4 million in every year so
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
that means we have transferred 14.2
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
million we have 25.8 million to go
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that we will do 4 million a
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
year every year we will be making
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
transfers for seven more years how did
 
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
we identify additional Revenue as a
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
result of rims right now it's really
 
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
three ways
 
02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
One turns out if you just remind people
 
02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
that they have a tax notice they'll pay
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
it so we had no ability under Tims we
 
02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
would just send out a tax notice and if
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't paid their appeal rights ended
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
and we sent them to collection now under
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
rims we have the ability after 30 days
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
to send a reminder letter and you know
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
what a lot of people pay when you just
 
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
remind them that they have an amount
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
owed so last year um we generated
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
revenue from reminder to pay from the
 
02:37:05.309 --> 02:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
use of federal tax information that's
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
information from the IRS they have very
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
strict rules and regulations on how that
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
information can be stored and used and
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
our old system did not meet those
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
regulations so we can now use federal
 
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
tax information um in a much better way
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we now have the ability
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
to go online and you can request a
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
payment plan and so long as it falls
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
within certain parameters it is
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
automatically granted with no
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
intervention from the Department that
 
02:37:39.269 --> 02:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
has significantly increased compliance
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and so all told last year those three
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
things generated 14 and5
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
million um but per statute we only
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
transferred the 4 million to the
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund so the point here is rims
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
successful so you would sign into the
 
02:38:04.269 --> 02:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
portal and request a payment plan um
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
right through granite tax
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
connect oh to be notified you oh we send
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
we send you a reminder letter both in
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
the mail and in the portal
 
02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
the mail and in the portal
yeah

02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah sounds good okay so long as you
 
02:38:23.309 --> 02:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a dog it's okay that e that
 
02:38:25.469 --> 02:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
eats it all right are we all set anyone
 
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
have any questions one last question
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so one uh final
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
question would be so if anybody's really
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
heartbroken over the indd tax going away
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
did they have the option to write a
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
check to the state or will the state I
 
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
am not going to cash

the committee so the document I gave you

earlier that has the coin on the front
 
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
if you flip the page it had the list of
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
the um people from our
 
02:39:09.389 --> 02:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
office on the top of the page is a web
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
our website just want to draw your
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
attention to the one that starts
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
specific to budget and Reven Revenue
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
documents all the documents that you
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
were um handed out last week at the
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
economic presentations all the documents
 
02:39:23.309 --> 02:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
that you received today and going
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
forward will be posted on that website
 
02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
so if you're leave here in a rush and
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
you leave all your documents here and
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
you wanted to review something you could
 
02:39:34.110 --> 02:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
go to our website and take a look at
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
that um so I just wanted to make sure
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
that that you were aware of that also
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the meetings are being streamed so
 
02:39:42.990 --> 02:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted to go back and listen
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
to Lindy's presentation you could do
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I think you can fast forward
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
through me pretty quickly and get to her
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
so but if you just for members too as

02:39:55.269 --> 02:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
um that members may come and go due to
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%

136 I'm going to open the public hearing
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%

your first bill of the
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
term so I'm representative Sally fellows
 
03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
and I represent Plymouth Ashlin and
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
holderness and what I'd like to talk to
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
you today about is raising the age for
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh sports betting from 18 to
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
21 as a little bit of the background in
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
2018 the US Supreme Court struck down a
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
federal law that had prohibited sports
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
betting in almost all of the states as
 
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
of September last year 40 States now
 
03:40:23.389 --> 03:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
allow sports betting and 32 of those
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
betting the minimum age for sports
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
betting is 21 in all but seven states
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
two of those states do not allow online
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
betting this bill raises the minimum age
 
03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
for only sports betting from 18 to 21
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
the minimum age for charity gaming
 
03:40:55.229 --> 03:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
remains at
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
18 the fiscal note shows that um 18 19
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
and 20 year olds wagered more than $14
 
03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
million in FY
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
24 so let me explain why I'm asking you
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
to raise the
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
age we all know that 18 19 and 20 year
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
olds particularly males are for far more
 
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
likely than mature adults to engage in
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
Risky and dangerous behaviors such as
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
smoking reckless driving binge drinking
 
03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
smoking reckless driving binge drinking
and

03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:35.359 --> 03:41:36.910 align:start position:0%
and
gambling

03:41:36.910 --> 03:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
because their cognitive ability is eval
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the consequences of their
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
actions has not completely
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
developed we also know about the
 
03:41:52.110 --> 03:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
addictive addictive qualities of cell
 
03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
addictive addictive qualities of cell
phone

03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
phone
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
apps the damage they can have on mental
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
health of teens and young adults and how
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
those apps suck up time that could be
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
spent in healthy
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
activities and
 
03:42:10.990 --> 03:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
finally we know most sports betting
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
takes place on cell phones where bets
 
03:42:15.870 --> 03:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
can be made on events
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
happening around the world this easy 247
 
03:42:24.269 --> 03:42:24.279 align:start position:0%
access paired with the fastpaced betting
 
03:42:27.790 --> 03:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities has an addiction rate
 
03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
higher than any other form of
 
03:42:34.389 --> 03:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
gambling raising the age the minimum age
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
for sports betting to 21 will give high
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
school students and recent grads three
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
more years to mature then they will be
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
better able to budget their bets avoid
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
financial disaster and avoid emotional
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
distress the purpose of this bill is to
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of gamblers who will
 
03:42:59.279 --> 03:43:00.710 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of gamblers who will
become

03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
become
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
addicted when I when you have a chance I
 
03:43:07.110 --> 03:43:07.120 align:start position:0%

03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
is the the difference between an
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
18-year-old in charitable gaming betting
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%

sports betting either in the casinos or
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
online and I gave I read an abbreviated
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
version of my testimony and the actual
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
what I passed out it told you that there
 
03:44:09.429 --> 03:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
were four casinos where they can do
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
sports betting the difference in terms
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
of um potential
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
addiction is that the casinos at least
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
now they're not open 24 hours a day so
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's it takes up more of somebody's time
 
03:44:28.030 --> 03:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
and they they can't be in the casino 24
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
hours a day but they can be with their
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.830 --> 03:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
bets yes represent
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
fellows I I I'm a little confused in
 
03:44:50.429 --> 03:44:50.439 align:start position:0%
reading your um repaired
 
03:44:52.510 --> 03:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
statement uh you say the fiscal note
 
03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
shows at 18 19 and 20 year olds wagered
 
03:44:59.149 --> 03:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
more than 14 million in fy2 24 but it
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
um I you can go online if you just
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
Google new Hampshire lottery sports
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
betting Revenue you will get a report
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
that looks like this so this report
 
03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
shows the total amount it has um two it
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
has the one section is about mobile
 
03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
sports betting one is about uh in the
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
casinos and then the third section is
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
the total and so all I did is the fiscal
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
note tells us that the 18 19 and 20 year
 
03:45:45.750 --> 03:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
olds um
 
03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
olds um
wagered

03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
wagered
 
03:45:52.510 --> 03:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
1.5% of of the total Wagers so I just
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
applied that
 
03:45:56.189 --> 03:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
1.9% to the total amount that was
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
wagered well followup actually I didn't
 
03:46:01.229 --> 03:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
get to ask my question but um as I'm
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
reading the fiscal note um it you're
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
you're correct it says state revenue
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
from um sports betting was $ 33.6
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
million total and that um individuals
 
03:46:18.510 --> 03:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
under the age of 21 accounted for
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
1.9% of that which they're saying the
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
revenue uh that you could attribute to
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.149 --> 03:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
$639,000 total so that's Revenue to the
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
state so you start out with this if you
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
had a copy of this report the First
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
Column says handle and that's the amount
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
of money that was B Deb and the second
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
column says how much is retained by the
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
operator and then the third column is
 
03:46:56.670 --> 03:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
the one that that figure is in that's
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
the amount that comes into the state as
 
03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
state revenue right does that answer
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
your question one one more followup I gu
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm getting at
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative is what this committee is
 
03:47:10.990 --> 03:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
most concerned about is revenue and the
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
impact on Revenue um that's our charge
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and it and it seems to me that that
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
people might get confused about the 14
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
million when in fact what we're talking
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
about appears to be an impact of um less
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
than $640,000
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
to revenue to the state if if if your
 
03:47:35.309 --> 03:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
bill were to be adopted that it's so so
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you in my statement in
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony is I'm telling you how much
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
money the 18 19 and 20 year-olds bet how
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
much they placed for wages in the end
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of that that that filters
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
back and becomes state revenue is the
 
03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
600,000 figure so that's the impact on
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
the state budget the impact on the
 
03:48:09.630 --> 03:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
families of those teens is that they bet
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
14 more than $14
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
million and
 
03:48:16.590 --> 03:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
that you know I mean they won some of
 
03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
time representative sod yeah thank you
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
do you have any results about how they
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
do comparatively to other ages as far as
 
03:48:33.870 --> 03:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
winning and losing so I having a little
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
hard time hearing you so the results of
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh winning and losing versus other ages
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
do you have any results like that do
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
they do better or worse than um you mean
 
03:48:45.630 --> 03:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
older people you mean um if you were
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
looking for the type of gambling that
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
gives you the best likely return yeah
 
03:48:54.670 --> 03:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
their win ratio do they so I
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
can I can tell you for the lottery
 
03:48:59.710 --> 03:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
tickets that the mega Buck is the one
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
with the best odds uh sports betting is
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
definitely not not the best and it um it
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
could be the worst one of the things I'm
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
not I don't do any sports betting but
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
there are different kinds of Wagers you
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
can make when you you do Sports spts
 
03:49:17.229 --> 03:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
betting and there's one I don't know if
 
03:49:18.750 --> 03:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
you have any experts here something that
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
begins with P that is the the least
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
likely um has the worst
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
odds that's the best way that's the
 
03:49:33.550 --> 03:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
it yes represent ORS thank you Mr chair
 
03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
so I think the question being asked was
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
the age group
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
embedding I think rep sod was asking you
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
if teenagers do they win more or less
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
than other age groups like 21 to 25
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
maybe or is that the question oh o oh
 
03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:57.630 align:start position:0%
maybe or is that the question oh o oh
okay

03:49:57.630 --> 03:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
so this is just an anecdote so somebody
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
who I had a conversation with a A friend
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
of mine who um knows a lot about sports
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
betting and he tells me that the
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
teenagers they're they they're just they
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't do well at all because they think
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
they know they think they they they're
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
teenagers they they think they're really
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
smart smarter than their parents and
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
they think they're very smart and can
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
figure out which team is going to win
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they they don't even know they don't
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
know what they don't know and they
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably lose more than some other
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
people I would think firsttime betters
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
probably takes a while to get used to it
 
03:50:40.439 --> 03:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
probably takes a while to get used to it
too

03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
follow uh yes follow up on that so um am
 
03:50:51.309 --> 03:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
I would I be right to assume then uh if
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
the question of lowering the voting age
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
came up to 16 you would be against that
 
03:50:55.399 --> 03:50:56.189 align:start position:0%
came up to 16 you would be against that
as

03:50:56.189 --> 03:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
well lowering the voting
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
age I would have to give that a lot of
 
03:51:04.349 --> 03:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
thought I don't know I don't know if I
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
would support it or
 
03:51:08.830 --> 03:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
not I don't want to increase a voting
 
03:51:13.550 --> 03:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure any other
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
03:51:21.790 --> 03:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and and um the next person may
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
be able to answer some of your questions
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
better than I
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%

03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
gambling in my line of work I'm often
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
heard speaking about operating in the
 
03:52:27.550 --> 03:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
gray space typically people consider
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
most issues black or white but I would
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
say that most aspects of gambling are
 
03:52:35.469 --> 03:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
actually pretty gray the products the
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
type the speeds these are all things
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
that are considered in the gray space
 
03:52:42.189 --> 03:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
because while they are legal and mostly
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
regulated not everyone agrees on what is
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
quote right or wrong there are often
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
moral concerns connected to gambling and
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
research can find positive and negative
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
consequences for example there has been
 
03:52:58.030 --> 03:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
research that signifies that promotions
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
for and visits to traditional casinos
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
can be beneficial for older adults their
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
physical and emotional health due to the
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
social connections walking around the
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
casino even elevated heart rates from
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
winning or or almost winning in a casino
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
and what that can provide
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
on the other hand other research notes
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
all the ways that the financial losses
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
and disagreements among family members
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
can have severe negative consequences on
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
their mental health and their
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
connections to ties at home older adults
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
gambling is very much what I consider a
 
03:53:34.670 --> 03:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
gray issue but what I'm here to talk to
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
about talk with you all about today to
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
me is a clear black and white issue no
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
research no research in the world has
 
03:53:45.189 --> 03:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
been done on youth younger adults that
 
03:53:48.269 --> 03:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
would tell you that a less mature brain
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate for gambling than a
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
more mature brain it is 100% a fact that
 
03:53:58.110 --> 03:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
an immature prefrontal cortex is not
 
03:54:00.550 --> 03:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
able to discern the level of risk-taking
 
03:54:02.349 --> 03:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
that is involved in gambling in
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
particular with sports wagering well I
 
03:54:07.229 --> 03:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
don't pretend to be a neuroscientist so
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
please don't ask me any Neuroscience
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions I do know that we can't argue
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the black and white issue that
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
18-year-olds are not prepared to be able
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
to appropriately react and respond to
 
03:54:20.830 --> 03:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
the lur of advertisements and promotions
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
available on Sports spending apps youth
 
03:54:25.469 --> 03:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
gambling is one of a few black and white
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
issues in the gambling
 
03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
field in fact in all the states where we
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
work and you just heard representative
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
fellows um talk about all the states um
 
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
where Sports gambling is legal the age
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
to gamble on Sports wagering is
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
21 that is true in the vast majority of
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
the states where Sports wagering has
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
been legalized it is most certainly the
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
more common public policy nationally
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
with all state regulated and tribal
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
gaming the gambling offerings in those
 
03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
states do financially very well if not
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
better with only 21y olds betting on
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
them in those States there's truly no
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
reason to put your young people here in
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at risk in fact there's no
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
reason to put any young people at risk
 
03:55:13.710 --> 03:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
I've personally spent the last 24 years
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
of my career care working on this issue
 
03:55:18.030 --> 03:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
my organization has worked with
 
03:55:20.269 --> 03:55:20.279 align:start position:0%
legislators and Regulators to strengthen
 
03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
the safety net available to people who
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
make the choice to gamble in
 
03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there are significant
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
regulations tools and resources that
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
have been put forth to ensure that young
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
people are not put In Harm's Way and
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately so as one of the largest
 
03:55:38.670 --> 03:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
risk factors for someone ending up with
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
a gambling problem is the early age of
 
03:55:43.950 --> 03:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
onset of gambling the earlier they start
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
the more more likely they are to develop
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
a gambling problem and so it's quite
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
upsetting to me that after all of our
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
efforts almost all young Massachusetts
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
residents need to do is to cross the
 
03:55:58.229 --> 03:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
border into New Hampshire to gamble
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
whether to set up the app or walk into a
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
casino it has been a write of passage
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
for 18-year-olds typically young men on
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
or near their 18th birthday to visit New
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for this very purpose this is
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
particularly distressing as we talk to
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
gambling treatment providers ERS high
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
school counselors College administrators
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
Etc who are seeking who are seeing
 
03:56:22.110 --> 03:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me the negative impacts of kids
 
03:56:24.309 --> 03:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
gambling we know that young people don't
 
03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
have the mental emotional or financial
 
03:56:28.349 --> 03:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
capacity to bounce back from dramatic
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
Sports wagering losses in fact I used to
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
say that there was no form of gambling
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
that was more harmful than another but
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
we now have forms of gambling and
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
research that refutes that Sports
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
wagering and online casino gambling are
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely seen to be more problematic
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
than other forms of of gambling
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of age in New Hampshire you
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
have both and you're currently allowing
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
18-year-olds to gamble on them and is
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
with that that I need to also share that
 
03:56:58.510 --> 03:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
I am a mom in addition to a CEO I'm a
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts mother to three kids
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
including two teenage boys and a
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
10-year-old daughter my boys are huge
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
sports fanatics they are already in in
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
data on television during live events on
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
social media apps but they are
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely feeling the pre peer pressure
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
of going going to New Hampshire to
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
gamble in fact I L an educational
 
03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
here um at my younger son school where I
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to 300 young men who sat there and
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
told me like they were reading me
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
something they knew was 100% true that
 
03:57:36.189 --> 03:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
the least harmful form of gambling was
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
Sports waging because there they could
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
make the most educated gambling
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
decisions and that they had more control
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
over the way the wager would go these
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
are babes making uninformed decisions
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to ask for your help both
 
03:57:53.469 --> 03:57:53.479 align:start position:0%
as a CEO and a mom please support House

rero hello I'm Janine rero Chief
 
03:58:41.710 --> 03:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
marketing officer for the Massachusetts
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
Council on gaming and health I'm also a
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
former marketing director for a casino
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh with a retail
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
draftking sports book and I live in
 
03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
Auburn New Hampshire I also support
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
raising the gambling age from 18 to 21
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
um from an operator perspective I'll
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
just give my anecdote is that this
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
particular segment between 18 to 21 year
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
olds they are not a segment that
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
operators are marketing to very well
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
anyway um at least on the retail side
 
03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
because with sports books you have
 
03:59:13.149 --> 03:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
sports bars and of course you can't
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily promote with them a beer or
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
a food package and their wallet size is
 
03:59:20.189 --> 03:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
not significant enough um I know we were
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
just discussing the the bigger um the
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
bigger amount of Revenue but even on an
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
individual level they're not significant
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
enough to the operator um but again that
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
small benefit the bigger risk is of
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
course as Marlene explained that the
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
younger somebody gets used to that
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
normalization of gambling that's too
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
accessible it really does become a
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
problem so I support raising the age to
 
03:59:42.800 --> 03:59:45.229 align:start position:0%
problem so I support raising the age to
21

03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
21

83

04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and we'll hear from the director of
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
directory of director of Lottery uh good
 
04:01:15.790 --> 04:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman members of the
 
04:01:17.710 --> 04:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Charlie McIntyre
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
I have the privilege of being the
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Lottery
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
and have been for almost 15 years uh and
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the question regarding age 18 to 21
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
is really a policy decision of you folks
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the governor and so we wouldn't take
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill our fiscal note
 
04:01:34.110 --> 04:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
represents what we believe to be be the
 
04:01:37.149 --> 04:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the state um and that
 
04:01:39.750 --> 04:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
$600,000 figure is essentially what
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
would would have been last year's net
 
04:01:44.750 --> 04:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state from
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
better as are 18 19 and 20 so but I'm
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
have or anything else rent
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
elme thank you do you have any thoughts
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
about how difficult it would be to
 
04:02:03.389 --> 04:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
ascertain the age of 18 to 21 year
 
04:02:07.710 --> 04:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
olds online it's it's easy the
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
technology exists through the through
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
the phone it's actually quite um
 
04:02:13.269 --> 04:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
Advanced uh in person is another
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
question so certainly it's open to it's
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
one of the most difficult things we have
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
is you you can buy lottery ticket 18
 
04:02:22.030 --> 04:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's 1,400 stores that sell lottery
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
tickets essentially and there are
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
between five and 50 clerks at any given
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
store who have to be trained on age
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
verification so that's one of the most
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
difficult things we have uh it's where
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
human beings are the technology on the
 
04:02:37.229 --> 04:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
the app is actually quite
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
good anybody
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.750 --> 04:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
when you gamble you either have to have
 
04:02:52.510 --> 04:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
a debit card or cash is that correct
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
correct there's no current law that
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
prohibits credit uh we just as a matter
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
of policy don't do it because candidly I
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
personally and our agency in general
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
just don't like the thought of using
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
debt so it's either debit card or it's
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
cash or like an a transfer something
 
04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:10.149 align:start position:0%
cash or like an a transfer something
like

04:03:10.149 --> 04:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that followup followup
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
therefore would it be correct to say
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
that a person who's placed in a bet is
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
limited by the amount of hard currency
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
they have on
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
correct yes representative
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy is it possible to make this
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral by increasing how much
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
the state gets from the the
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
operator I mean anything's possible but
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
we currently are the number two or three
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction out of the 40 in terms of
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
profitability to the state uh we have a
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
negotiated contract that is the Envy of
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
Most states around the US and so and
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
also as part of that agreement
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
DraftKings actually built an office in
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
nashwa and employees people in that
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
office and so uh it's a very
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
exceptionally lucrative contract so not
 
04:04:08.149 --> 04:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
anything's possible but I would imagine
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
04:04:19.149 --> 04:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you director
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um my observation is that the
 
04:04:22.600 --> 04:04:23.309 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um my observation is that the
uh

04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
control of
 
04:04:28.510 --> 04:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
the uh sports betting is very tightly
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
restricted to the boundaries of New
 
04:04:32.429 --> 04:04:32.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my cell phone doesn't work if
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just on the border have to be in New
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so isn't it true that anyone
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts truly has to move
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire not just be nearby to
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
use the DraftKings application they
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
would have so there's a the state is Geo
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
fenced which is easy on the west side
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
because of the conut river it's a little
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
tough on the southern border so it's
 
04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
around 300 feet in is where the border
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
is and so um I will tell you the early
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
days of sports betting the most popular
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
places were the Portsmouth liquor store
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
and the Mall of New Hampshire and then
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
liquor store in New hampsh in Nash um a
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
lot of folks came up from Massachusetts
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
tobet and so if you had the DraftKings
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
app and you loaded it it would work here
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
if you were within further distance you
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it for Massachusetts you
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
barred okay anybody

04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
read uh my my printer does not connect
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
with my
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
computer on a quarter of a century ago
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
the LBA AO and I aided by legislative
 
04:08:58.349 --> 04:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
drafting restructured the 612 list which
 
04:09:02.670 --> 04:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
was fairly small and half of it was uh
 
04:09:02.680 --> 04:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
was fairly small and half of it was uh
repealed

04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
already um we
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
found and deleted long inactive funds
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
added the trusts and endowment funds
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
told the agencies which funds were their
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities a lot of the agencies
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
didn't even know these dedicated funds
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
existed that were in their Province and
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
sent out a message that any dedicated
 
04:09:28.750 --> 04:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
funds not within 612 would have their
 
04:09:31.389 --> 04:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
funds sent to the general
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
fund uh that one was repealed a few
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
years later but it served its purpose at
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
first um and we assigned all the funds
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
to legislative committees
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
since then we haven't changed the basic
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
structure but we and I and the finance
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee have been trying out a lot of
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
different methods of getting the other
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
um committees to pay attention to the
 
04:10:02.670 --> 04:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
fact that they had these dedicated
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
funds because and we are still getting
 
04:10:12.429 --> 04:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
committees that send bills out that are
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
already in in a dedicated fund that they
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't need to send out again they need
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to make it work so um
 
04:10:25.149 --> 04:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
that's what the
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
original uh plan
 
04:10:28.640 --> 04:10:31.750 align:start position:0%
original uh plan
was

04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
but we we do have a near-perfect listing
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the dedicated
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
funds um of the state now
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
and oh I'm going I'm going between
 
04:10:54.640 --> 04:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
and oh I'm going I'm going between
sections

04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
um we yeah we do have a near perfect
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
listing of the dedicated funds of the
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
state and every year the dedicated fund
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee reviews all the funds of about
 
04:11:14.109 --> 04:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
a a fifth of all the Departments
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
rotation cleaning out Deadwood pointing
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
out overlaps and deviations from the
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fund checking for
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
unwarranted increases or losses in fund
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
balance and recommending fee decreases
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
or increases to the relevant
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee and sometimes writing the bill
 
04:11:38.189 --> 04:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
with them but over time a lot of errors
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
in designation of
 
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
fund as uh set up by the state for a
 
04:11:46.000 --> 04:11:47.710 align:start position:0%
fund as uh set up by the state for a
specific

04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
source is that that kind of fund is
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
confused with a trust that was sent up
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
by an external group with a specific
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
purpose and held by the state treasurer
 
04:12:12.269 --> 04:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
and custodial accounts uh set up by the
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
courts for specific individuals or
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
reasons who held and dispers and held
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
and dispersed by the treasury we had not
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
really understood the
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
differences and sometimes we're
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
classifying one entity as another
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
entity this revision of 612s resolves
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
those problems by defin clearly defining
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
the three types of fund and their
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
purposes organizing the
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
funds on uh list and adding several
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
funds uh that were in departments that
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
had avoided the the listing before that
 
04:12:58.510 --> 04:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
was the treasurers doing um and and then
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
finally we have a list at the end of
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
this that repeals 13 funds I believe all
 
04:13:07.830 --> 04:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
of those 13 funds are put in their
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
proper places in in the legislation
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
um in the text between the two of
 
04:13:21.550 --> 04:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
them we may have killed one of the funds
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but if we did it no longer
 
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
exist it it does not exist in practice
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
we have a fair number of funds at this
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.920 --> 04:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
have uh zero balance have had zero
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
balance for quite a while have had zero
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
balance ever since they were F started
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
which the agencies in in
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
question insists they want to keep
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
around because maybe some money would
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
come from the feds for a purpose then
 
04:14:03.070 --> 04:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
they'll need it right away or
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
maybe uh there will be an emergency and
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
we need to pour money into that fund so
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
that we can use it
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
properly and uh We've in general given
 
04:14:18.429 --> 04:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
given them permission to do that and
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
we've also removed uh long time ago now
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
we've removed the uh fund for the
 
04:14:25.760 --> 04:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
we've removed the uh fund for the
nuclear

04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
plant which uh is very well audited
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
already and a number and recently we've
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
removed the universities because they
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
are audited separately and a few others
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
that are in that General box
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
but um we
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.910 --> 04:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
about uh a
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
month uh emailing back and forth to each
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
other finding the things that the other
 
04:15:02.469 --> 04:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
person hadn't found and I think it's in
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
so I take any questions thank you
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
represent El me and as you can see if
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
you look at the sponsor list um I'm I'm
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
on here as well as well as if you read
 
04:15:18.189 --> 04:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
through the list all those people were
 
04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
on the the committee joint committee to
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
study this so um we we went through with
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
the fine tooth com uh representa Aly did
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
the probably the Lion Share of coming
 
04:15:31.750 --> 04:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
through it uh but we've also had Dr look
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
at it as well yes
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:15:38.710 --> 04:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:15:42.189 --> 04:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
question I think this may be a really
 
04:15:45.070 --> 04:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
you've obviously a lot of work here I'm
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
also uh Trustee of trust funds in
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
Greenland we deal with trust funds I see
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
trusts written up here some of these are
 
04:15:52.840 --> 04:15:53.790 align:start position:0%
trusts written up here some of these are
trust

04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
trust
 
04:15:56.590 --> 04:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
funds uh it's probably a different whole
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
structure than we would do in a in a
 
04:16:00.030 --> 04:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
town thing but by
 
04:16:00.040 --> 04:16:01.830 align:start position:0%
town thing but by
merely

04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
merely
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
restating a state law or putting that
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
overlay on
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
this you can take a trust fund and move
 
04:16:12.670 --> 04:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
it into something else without a probate
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
or non-judicial settlement or things
 
04:16:17.670 --> 04:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
like that that's that's all I that's
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
about my extent of my knowledge I'm just
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
asking the question yeah well trust
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
funds in general have to go to the
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
attorney and escros I think also have to
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
go to the attor Attorney General's
 
04:16:33.550 --> 04:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
office of charitable trusts and spend a
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
fair amount of time
 
04:16:39.790 --> 04:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
being checked over and then they finally
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
decide yes you can move it or no you
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
can't we had a case with
 
04:16:49.710 --> 04:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
two very small um trust funds set up by
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
well-meaning people in uh Kean area one
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
of which is for Keen State University no
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
Keen State
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
College uh to two of them both of them
 
04:17:07.630 --> 04:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
are for the Keen State College one of
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
them is also for Plymouth um to divvy up
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
scholar ship
 
04:17:16.830 --> 04:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
funds the money hasn't been used because
 
04:17:18.590 --> 04:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
money to do that um and we wanted I
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to just remove them completely
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and stick them into the university
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
system and say go at it um or just yes
 
04:17:35.670 --> 04:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
just use it for Keane and
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth as part of the money that you
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
give them uh it didn't
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
um uh it didn't pass the test of the
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
AG's office and so what they've decided
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
to do is to just send a check every year
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money to the
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate college and tell them to
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
spend it for
 
04:17:59.880 --> 04:18:01.550 align:start position:0%
spend it for
that

04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
but on the trust funds in the Treasury
 
04:18:08.920 --> 04:18:10.670 align:start position:0%
but on the trust funds in the Treasury
Office

04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
Office
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
are are different and I think probably
 
04:18:19.149 --> 04:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
better audited than the ones in the
 
04:18:21.790 --> 04:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
towns my Treasurer probably would object
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
to my saying that representative
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
om yeah thank you representative Al for
 
04:18:29.950 --> 04:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
your service on the study committee is
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
it fair to say that there are no policy
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill strictly a
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
streamline of the process there there
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
are no changes in of policy in this bill
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
um because you reminded me um
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion that we take the
 
04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee out of the
 
04:18:53.070 --> 04:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
process for everything except the trust
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the original dedicated funds that
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
are not trusts and not
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
escr and some of us maybe all of us I
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
can't remember F back about that because
 
04:19:11.670 --> 04:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
it meant that um we do have a fair
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
number of funds
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
dangerously near zero that are supposed
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
to be taking care of things we have
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
others that are up to four times as much
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
as they need and aren't saving for
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
anything in
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
particular and it helps if we can look
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
at them once every five years and
 
04:19:41.790 --> 04:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
um give them a some ideas about how they
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
situation yes representative shamber
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative taking this question on
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
page two lines 28
 
04:19:56.520 --> 04:19:58.309 align:start position:0%
page two lines 28
through

04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
33 there's a change for the
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
administrator of each fund to go from
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
September to October 15th to
 
04:20:08.189 --> 04:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
report but there was no change for the
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
November 15th uh is that just a simple
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
process of of
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
the account managers needed more fund or
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
the administrators need more more time
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
before October 15th uh are there
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
deadlines in there somewhere that they
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
have to meet this is something that came
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
up uh a change that came from the com
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
troller and I think that uh we didn't
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
ask about it at the time why they wanted
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
to to make that a month later the
 
04:20:42.880 --> 04:20:44.269 align:start position:0%
to to make that a month later the
November

04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
November
 
04:20:44.279 --> 04:20:46.229 align:start position:0%
November
one

04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
is is I think kind of important to stay
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
with and they felt that they could get
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
those once they had those
 
04:20:57.359 --> 04:20:59.070 align:start position:0%
those once they had those
reports

04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
digitally uh by October 15th they could
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
get them easily over to to the format
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think we asked that question but
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
no they were the ones that volunteered
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
it I'm thinking many of these reports uh
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
need to come out by November 1st and so
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
this probably is giving a little more
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
time maybe to get it finalized but it's
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
but it's being done at least two weeks
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
before the November 1st yeah that there
 
04:21:35.520 --> 04:21:38.109 align:start position:0%
before the November 1st yeah that there
is

04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
a a standard format for all of these in
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
what I used to call a telephone book but
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
most people don't get it anymore it's
 
04:21:46.760 --> 04:21:48.269 align:start position:0%
most people don't get it anymore it's
online

04:21:48.269 --> 04:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:21:48.279 --> 04:21:49.830 align:start position:0%
online
uh

04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty is that it is the
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
only place that we've got that gives
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
what the fund operator thinks is the
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
fund uh they're required to give the
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fund as well as on what
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
the last five years of of um ending and
 
04:22:16.990 --> 04:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
beginning balances was
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
and on there was three two three years
 
04:22:24.030 --> 04:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
no it's been five years now because we
 
04:22:26.750 --> 04:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
just had them in again the new
 
04:22:29.149 --> 04:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
department when it was new of cultural
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
resour and natural resources had Absolut
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
they they threw everything they could
 
04:22:37.149 --> 04:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
think of into that that they didn't want
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere else and it was pretty
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
difficult for them we talked to them the
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
first time I think after only a year
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
they had managed to mix up all the
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
purposes they had no idea what was going
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
on and we worked with them and and their
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
this seeing seeing none then um I will
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
public no I don't we have a oh no no yes
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
we do need it yeah what's that no we do
 
04:23:42.269 --> 04:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we do need it I thought we had
 
04:23:42.279 --> 04:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we do need it I thought we had
it

04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'm going to close the
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%

04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
than it appears as though uh most in the
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
commit are
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a housekeeping
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 163 is it appropriate to move to
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
Executive session at this
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%

04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so let's uh we'll just uh hold off
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.349 --> 04:25:13.359 align:start position:0%

consent
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
calendar and um without objection unless
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
somebody has an objection of course we
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
all just voted for
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
it yeah but some people okay
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah let me close I'll close the
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
executive session or no maybe I won't
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
close it yet um without so the consent
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
calendar for those of you who are new um
 
04:29:56.349 --> 04:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of bills if they're like
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know in this case 15 to zero or 17
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
to1 or whatever they can go on something
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
called the consent calendar unless they
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a FIS I believe unless they have a
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh impact um then they'd have to
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
come up or vote when we go into house
 
04:30:11.720 --> 04:30:12.750 align:start position:0%
come up or vote when we go into house
session

04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
at the next session um there'll be
 
04:30:17.309 --> 04:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
something where we vote on the consent
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
calendar and the the speaker will say
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
all in favor of adopting the consent
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
calendar any bills like this one on
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
consent will automatically be passed uh
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
or well I should say would
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
automatically whatever their designation
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
is this is OTP so it's going to be
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
passed there's other bills that most of
 
04:30:36.269 --> 04:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
the people in the committee say itl
 
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
which means inexpedient to legislate
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
those will be killed um and then it
 
04:30:42.750 --> 04:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
takes I believe it takes 10 people or
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
did the rules change on that to take it
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
off they tried to change it to three but
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think it I don't think it passed
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
didn't okay it's still 10 so it takes 10
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
people if there's 10 reps who don't want
 
04:30:57.550 --> 04:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
it to go consent they've got to get
 
04:31:01.109 --> 04:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
together and let the clerk know yes the
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
party that use your phone as the party
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
that wanted to get to
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
three uh was saying uh there was a
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
coalition of people formed on the
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
Republican side that promised to all
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
vote 10 people vote uh
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh SP co-sponsor the resolution the the
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
requests for can to come off consent uh
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
so that a whole lot of things came off
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
consent that those 10 people weren't
 
04:31:34.600 --> 04:31:36.750 align:start position:0%
consent that those 10 people weren't
voting

04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
voting
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
for I'm not sure I understood what you
 
04:31:42.269 --> 04:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
just said I'm sorry I'm a little goofy
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
at the moment okay that made sense
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
inside baseball politics for those that
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
are watching at home yeah okay but the
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
10 people doesn't seem to make a
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
difference yeah so okay so it's unlikely
 
04:31:58.109 --> 04:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
that 10 people are going to get together
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
and pull this this one off consent um
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
okay I will close the executive session
 
04:32:04.109 --> 04:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
163 and um that concludes our business
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
for today however I just want to talk
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
about next week um
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%

where we when we do Revenue estimates we
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
have some basis for what we're talking
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
