sessions done of which you know we're
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%

will be thank you yeah yeah and it's
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
critical I've spoken with folks in uh
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
division two and they're really anxious
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
to really delve into this topic and I'm
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
sure you're hearing about this on your
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
local area so if you're a school
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
district that's trying to get building
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
eight and you're like seventh or eighth
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
down the list you're just not going to
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
get it and you may have a very critical
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
need and so there's a lot we have to
 
00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:03.230 align:start position:0%
need and so there's a lot we have to
address

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
um going on down to the uh calendar for
 
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:09.380 align:start position:0%
today we have hb204 relative to
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys in schools and I
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
like to recognize representative Belcher
 
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:16.940 align:start position:0%
from emotion
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would like to
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second second okay the
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
emotions were made by uh represent
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
Belcher second by representative
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli OTP on
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
hb204 representative Belcher recognized
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
for discussion thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
um I'll just
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
um kind of run over the reminder that
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
this this bill is really a very minor
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
change is only I believe three new words
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
added and the bill
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
um it does nothing at all to affect or
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
modify the ability of teachers to
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
maintain normal human relationships with
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
their students to understand the needs
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the feelings of their students their
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
individual situations the only thing it
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
seeks to prohibit is the surveying
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
through digital
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
um and physical means of students
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
emotional states along with the other
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
things that are already law and the
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
reason I think we need to do this is we
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
we need to begin to differentiate
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
um a little better between schools as
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
educational facilities police and mental
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
health facilities as being primarily
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and they they're not something that
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
need to be combined into the same unit
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
we need to keep schooling separate thank
 
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.010 align:start position:0%
we need to keep schooling separate thank
you

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.529 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:38.539 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
Elli do you have any further discussion
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
I'd just add that um initially I was
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
wondering about emotional response but I
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
think it's in line with uh some of the
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh other uh criteria in the last section
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
um it's not much different than uh
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
social behave Behavior so I am
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
supportive of this
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the committee
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I guess my concern
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
about this is that
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a hard line to draw here
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
if a teacher is working with a student
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they identify that there are some
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
issues here
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
we just say oh we're not going to deal
 
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:27.260 align:start position:0%
I mean you look at the amount of time
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
that a student
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
there ought to be an opportunity for
 
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.270 align:start position:0%
there ought to be an opportunity for
professionals

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
that deal with kids to identify that and
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
then then to basically help them deal
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
with those issues so I guess I totally
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
disagree with the representative Belcher
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
on this because uh it's not a medical
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're not MediCal folks so it's kind
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
of like you know I would assume I don't
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
know anything about EMTs
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
but I would assume that there's a
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
certain amount of stuff that EMTs can do
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
before they pass it over
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
to a medical professional
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
the same thing here with teachers I mean
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
if they see that there's a problem
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
that a child has an emotional problem a
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
child has they're clearly not they're
 
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.330 align:start position:0%
child has they're clearly not they're
not

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
the ultimate person who's going to deal
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
with that issue but then they pass it
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
over to the counselor
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
or they move it someplace else
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
but to say here oh no you can't deal
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
I just think it's absurd frankly I like
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
to just have a word here um I'm looking
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
at this in terms of non-academic survey
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
or questionnaire not as a EMT or a
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
counselor working specifically with a
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
student that's not a survey that's not a
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
question questionnaire that's one-on-one
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
or working collaboratively to address
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
what may be perceived as an issue and
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
have discussion
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so I see it as relating to like the
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey and I see a
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
question on the uterus survey that
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
really kind of concerns me as question
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
number 24 this is the New Hampshire
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
survey it says during the past 12 months
 
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
how many times did someone you were
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
dating or going out would purposely try
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
to control you or emotionally hurt you
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
all right so we already have emotionally
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
in the youth risk behavior survey
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
um is that a proper question to be
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
asking if in fact it was you know this
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
were passed it would not be a proper
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
question because it is in the
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
questionnaire it's in the survey and
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about emotions
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
so uh represent Belcher
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for that Mr chair I would note
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
that the the CDC survey is is continues
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
to be Exempted uh so I didn't remove
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
that particular survey but yes other
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
surveys was questions like that
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
um would not be uh allowable under this
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
but just to address the concerns that
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
were raised I think it goes in a very
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
different direction it's
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
um it's a very different argument to
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
have and it has nothing to do with this
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
bill really that that student or rather
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
that teacher should be able to
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
coordinate with parents to obtain proper
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
mental health for students who have
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
issues that that's a very different
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
argument to have but this bill does
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
nothing to address that this bill is
 
00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:26.299 align:start position:0%
just about surveys it's just about
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
asking students either in physical or
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
digital format about emotionally probing
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions that parents have come to me
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
with and said they're not comfortable
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
with these questions just being asked
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
without their permission of of their
 
00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:41.390 align:start position:0%
without their permission of of their
children

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so there's nothing that would
 
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.510 align:start position:0%
um so there's nothing that would
prohibit

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.010 align:start position:0%
prohibit
um

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
having a student with a problem receive
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
proper Mental Health Care under this uh
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
under this bill represent cascaden do
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up earlier
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I could not agree with you
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
more that education and school systems
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
are for education
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
but if you look back 10 to 15 years how
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
many laws have been passed by
 
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.390 align:start position:0%
many laws have been passed by
legislation

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
to impose more and more social services
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
within the school district it's it's
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and that's when you get
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
down to having to pick and choose what
 
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:24.020 align:start position:0%
do you do
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a need for this
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
bill honestly because we are required to
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
provide social emotional learning and
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be teaching kids now
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
did they eat did they not eat how do
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
they feel and eat how are they feeling
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
when they don't eat I mean is there
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
substance abuse in the home with
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
somebody in the home last night how all
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
of these social things that belong in
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
the home to be dealt with by a parent
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
are dumped on the school system when
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
that kid walks through the door
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
um what I'm concerned about in this bill
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
um you know even with drug and alcohol
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
education I mean that's a law that you
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
have to provide that
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's a need for this
 
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.370 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's a need for this
bill

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
until you start taking and repealing all
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
the social issues that have been plugged
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and represent Damon
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with you representative
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of that has come from the
 
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
um in terms of was Essa
 
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.669 align:start position:0%
um in terms of was Essa
um

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
the last well-round and No Child Left
 
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.750 align:start position:0%
the last well-round and No Child Left
Behind

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
Behind
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
required a large part of that with the
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
emotional learning Etc
 
00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
um required of States uh to be done
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
and yeah concerned about back then and I
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
think it's a concern for all of us
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
I want to remind all of us that this
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
bill is about surveys that the data is
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
aggregated it is not about individual
 
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:18.620 align:start position:0%
student data
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
Egret survey data is science that's used
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
to drive knowledge and programming I see
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
no valuable purpose to this bill I think
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
that if we don't collect data on the
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
well-being of students we don't know how
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of meeting their educational
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
needs you can't learn if you're not
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
reasonably mentally well thank you
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the representative uh pettinellen
 
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
then reps out I just wanted to point out
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
to representative cascadin that the part
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
that she was
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
that she was
um

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.529 align:start position:0%
um
taking

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh not a fence the right word objection
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
to was is already part of Statute the
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
other dot or other documents is part of
 
00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:04.909 align:start position:0%
other dot or other documents is part of
statute

00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden um I guess my
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
question would be a lot of schools will
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
do culture and climate surveys so they
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
can get a pulse beat on how kids are
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
feeling in the environment because
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
obviously that makes a difference
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
this bill would prevent that
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
and don't you want to measure
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
if if kids feel safe if they know who to
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
um that's a big piece of having a
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
healthy school environment
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent uh Rye
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
dry excuse me thank you thank you Mr
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again I'm a little
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
confused because this is about
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's not about getting rid of the survey
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
it's about your sub your participation
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
in it there's nothing here that forbids
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
a school from doing any of these surveys
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
it is how you participate and it goes
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
through the parents first and they're
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to look at it and they can give
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
their permission and
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
students can do it and emancipated
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
minors can do it on their own the survey
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
perhaps and Damon
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
in response to what representative drive
 
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
in survey work if you don't survey
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
as much of the population as you can you
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
don't collect the same data
 
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
don't collect the same data
so

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
more that we make it likely
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
that not as many students will
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
participate the less credible the data
 
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.230 align:start position:0%
participate the less credible the data
is

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:48.299 align:start position:0%
I remember a lot of objection from
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
teachers when various of the social
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
emotional learning came out there was
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning that didn't
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
involve surveys and keeping track and
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff but they're
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
ones and one of the schools that was in
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
my district
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
I heard from parents and teachers and
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
went and actually sat in on an open
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
house to find out exactly what they were
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
doing and they were doing these physical
 
00:27:17.409 --> 00:27:17.419 align:start position:0%
surveys with the little kids
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
tapping how they felt but they had to
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
record them and track them and all that
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and the teachers kept
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
saying this isn't my job I'm not a
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
health care professional this isn't what
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
I should be doing and you don't have to
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
do that to do social emotional learning
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
but some programs you do and they
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
actually have teachers taking surveys of
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
the kids and recording it and keeping
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
data and all of that and so this is if a
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
parent says no I don't want you doing
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
that to my kid they can say no don't do
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
that to my kid I mean that's it's kind
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
of a protection of the teachers as well
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
as the students
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
because yeah we're piling as you said
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
more and more and more on teachers that
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's not what they're supposed to be
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to make two quick
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
points first I want to correct I think a
 
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
small thing that was perhaps there
 
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.010 align:start position:0%
small thing that was perhaps there
um

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in this that would
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
get surgery between disaggregated data
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
surveys versus normal surveys and the
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
CDC is still under this authorized to
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
conduct their yearly survey but I would
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
also uh harken back my my own testimony
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
on this bill that we are entering a new
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
phase of Cutting Edge education where
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing algorithmically driven
 
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence data mining
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
children through Google through other
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
big programs creating things such as
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
little digital friends that they can
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
communicate with in order to apply
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
um something that's called nudge Theory
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
which is developed by British
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
psychological warfare experts in order
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
to actually change the way that children
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
are thinking about ideological and
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
values-based things and these are really
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
items that are controversial and a lot
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
of parents don't want to see this thing
 
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.649 align:start position:0%
of parents don't want to see this thing
done

00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's one line
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
well that's too bad because it should be
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
common practice
 
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.500 align:start position:0%
I mean it's my perception that happens
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
where most of the places have happened
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem it's not happening
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
somewhere it's an Administration problem
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody needs to get on board and
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
take care
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you could just make sure the chords
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
are plugged in properly into the back of
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
your mic and test your mic again
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
I've notified them upstairs
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
a representative Noble
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
um it it does happen
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
um without parental consent because it
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
did happen to my child and it's because
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
they were doing an online test and the
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
survey was at the end so she couldn't
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
complete her test without doing the
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.529 --> 00:30:35.539 align:start position:0%
true okay any further questions
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
can see none we have the chairman
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
upstairs in the Senate so um we'll hold
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
off on a vote on that
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
um Bill until uh we have a full
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
complement of members so um let's uh
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
open up the discussion on uh House Bill
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
267 School background checks
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh criminal record checks in school
 
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.029 align:start position:0%
uh criminal record checks in school
employment

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
and uh call upon representative try for
 
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.450 align:start position:0%
and uh call upon representative try for
emotion

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
if you want a motion then it's ought to
 
00:31:12.659 --> 00:31:14.630 align:start position:0%
if you want a motion then it's ought to
pass

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second oh second
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
second representative
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
um representative dry do you have uh
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill is an enabling Bill and it
 
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.210 align:start position:0%
so this bill is an enabling Bill and it
doesn't

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.769 align:start position:0%
doesn't
um

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
require it just allows uh school
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
administrative units school districts or
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools to do more than
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
just the initial criminal history
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
records check when someone is hired I
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
mean we may have seen recently in the
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
paper a case of someone who was in one
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
District committed a crime moved to
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
another District committed the same
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
crime perhaps that would be something
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
that would turn up in a
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
an employee situation it's enabling
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislation it just allows this and it's
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
a group of employees so that no person
 
00:32:20.289 --> 00:32:20.299 align:start position:0%
is singled out for any kind of
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
vindictness or or any any kind of
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
signaling out singling out for
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
um a records check so uh in the fact
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't make any requirements
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
but does open a door and certainly it's
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
a policy on many school levels but we
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
would like to codify it that's why I'm
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
its motion is ought to pass
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
representative Myler
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
I just have a question perhaps somebody
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
can answer for me is that when
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
when I get my initial
 
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
when I get my initial
check

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
I pay for that it's about forty eight
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars fifty dollars
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
if the school district asks for another
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
check who pays for that
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
does anybody have the answer to that
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
is it the school district is it the
 
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:28.250 align:start position:0%
is it the school district is it the
individual

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple concerns with this uh
 
00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:40.940 align:start position:0%
number one the group
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
portion of it that is supposed to
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
protect the individual well in a lot of
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
schools you know there's one art teacher
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
one school nurse one third grade teacher
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh maybe even you know one uh language
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
teacher and um
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
so groups don't won't cover uh the
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
individual and I think that this bill
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
could lead to some
 
00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:13.339 align:start position:0%
um unintended consequences of someone uh
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to dismiss a teacher not
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily for a criminal
 
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
necessarily for a criminal
problem

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
problem
but

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
um using it as a way of harassment
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing is that I would I
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
would think that um at least when I was
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
teaching uh what happened was that every
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
time you went for uh the three year or
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
five-year renewal you also went through
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
a background check which I think is
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
um sufficient
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely no thank you very much
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um
 
00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:52.190 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um
the

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the the new language here in the in
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
the bill certainly uses the word Public
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
School A Charter Public School or School
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
District may choose to require however
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
um this this isn't really typical of of
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation enabling
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
legislation is sort of like Senate Bill
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
2 from uh from you know 15 20 years ago
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
that would allow a school district or or
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
a town municipality to decide a town
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
meeting if they're going to use standard
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
town meeting or a deliberative session
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and and have votes this clearly
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
um would um would would allow uh public
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
schools in fact it would require public
 
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:36.980 align:start position:0%
schools to um to uh to be able to
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
negotiate terms into a collective
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement that would um that
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
would uh allow the public school to uh
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
to perform
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh more frequent or recurring uh
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
background checks on any group of
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
employees so it's not really enabling it
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
really puts it into the the next
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
um uh contract as a as a negotiating
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
item and I think as part of that the uh
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
the the the the negotiating
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
um uh item uh might include things like
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
what representative Miler was talking
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
about who's going to pay for the checks
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
how often are the criminal checks uh
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen uh to um uh for what
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
groups of uh of employees and uh and I
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
think it's it's that phrase any group of
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
employees where where this gets murky
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
very quickly whether that is as
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner has suggested
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
could be used to um to uh potentially
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
discriminate or or provide you know
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
challenges to uh to to certain groups of
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
of employees
 
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
of employees
um

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
any basis
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know whatsoever the the the
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
legislation is not uh uh specific on
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
that uh on that at all but um but you
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
know that set all of that said I think
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
there was some some good reason that was
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that was uh put forward by the
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
superintendent Goffstown that that that
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
they're they're I think there's some
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
value in doing this I'm not sure this
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
specific language is really the right
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
language to um
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
um to to to move forward and um in fact
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
I was I was hoping we'd have some sort
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
of mutual you know amending language on
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
this that that would sort of roll in the
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh the the the the interests of um of is
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
it superintendent bulky
 
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.190 align:start position:0%
it superintendent bulky
um

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
Brian balke in in Goffstown and also
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
address I think some of the concerns
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
that Captain Muzzy
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um uh shared and that we could actually
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
have something that uh you know
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
something that's really positive comes
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
that comes out of this I'm I'm sort of
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
disappointed we we but you know when we
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
got 100 bills to work on right it's it's
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
hard to necessarily fix fix everything
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
in time but but I you know I'm I I can't
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
support uh to passing you know an OTP
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know as it is right now
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I I really love it I think if we
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
could retain this bill and and and do
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
something do something with it
 
00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:27.109 align:start position:0%
something do something with it
um

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
you know I think criminal uh Records
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
checks are important and um uh not just
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
for for public for all public schools
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
but uh but really across the board
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um in uh in any situation where where
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
where you know an adult is going to be
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
in a um uh be with uh with a child or or
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple children so I think
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's I think there's value in here I
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
just hope we could work on the language
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
um resident Belcher maybe you want to
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
try your mic again
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
testing testing okay there we go thank
 
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.170 align:start position:0%
testing testing okay there we go thank
you

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
so with this bill I see it down the road
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
unless there have been a Scholars
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
attached to it's not quantitative so I
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
um the question also raised to you is
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
so it does give autonomy to the school
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
district under any reasonable suspicion
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
a group of employees is
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
does not fit
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
does not fit the language
 
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.770 align:start position:0%
does not fit the language
um

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
so I would like to say something
 
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:42.500 align:start position:0%
that gives autonomy to be able to
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
prevent a teacher from going from one
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
District to the next
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
so there are mechanisms I can tell you
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a superintendent to go test a student
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
in another District representative
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
I had to have another full criminal
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
record check after just the retired year
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
it worked in another District so every
 
00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
it worked in another District so every
District

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
whether you're a licensed educator
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
or you work you add criminal background
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
checking for your previous position in
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
the school system you are required to
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
get a remote records check for each
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
individual District you work
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
just clarification and
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see something
 
00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:36.849 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see something
foreign

00:41:36.849 --> 00:41:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
how this is an unfunded mandate when
 
00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:44.900 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandate it says may choose
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
and may choose is is about as
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
free and open as wording I can think of
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
that's the opposite of a child you may
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
choose to do this if you want to we're
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
giving permission that's all that is and
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
then my next part of that is a question
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
how would you word instead of any group
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
of employees to to make sure that it
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.550 align:start position:0%
you're not
um

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
going after an individual
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
what what wording you know if we can fix
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:26.050 align:start position:0%
 
free

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:26.060 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't we reiterate just a few
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
things that Roy even said I have a
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
couple pieces I thought the
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent of Goffstown was uh
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
purposeful I thought it was direct and
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
he came with a reason his reason was if
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you recall that he had uh 10-year not
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
tenured long-term employees who came
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
there before he did before the
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
background checks were part of the
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
current apparatus for uh hiring and he
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
has no way to check them
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
that's his concern the problem he had
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
with the collective buying agreement
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
didn't allow him to go back and check
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
the the status of the folks and that's
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
legit but that's why they have a
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
collective buying agreement and that's
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
why they haven't got a union to do that
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
to work with that I think he has a right
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
to know every single employee in that
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
school has been back on check everybody
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
that works for the youngster I don't
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
care where they work with a youngster
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
she have a background check at least the
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
first level let us know what we're doing
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
and as the superintendent said clearly I
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
have coached in multiple school with
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
them in a principal vanilla every time I
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
walk over different school another
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
background check another 66 bucks
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
um but that that being said I I have
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about two things but I think
 
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
the attack was terrific I think we have
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to do that and this
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
this build could be reworked to figure
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
that out the hypothesis group
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
um if the intent of the person asking
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
for the group is not uh above board or
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
has a premonition or has a bias that
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
changes how you select the group there's
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
no definition of group it could be all
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
the teachers on the first floor that
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
first floor in that school there's no
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
discipline going on the teacher's not
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
doing crap over there I'm going to
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
recheck the whole first floor that's my
 
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.609 align:start position:0%
recheck the whole first floor that's my
group

00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
we don't have to find a group I think
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's key the second part is we don't
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
say who can do that school district who
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
in the school district could do that the
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School who can ask for
 
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:26.990 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School who can ask for
that

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
so I I think the intent of this bill is
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
terrific but I don't think we have it
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
finalized the way we really need it and
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
for those couple of pieces
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
um I I well I like the I like the bill
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
like the intent because no one should be
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
in school no one should be working with
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
kids probably back on check but uh I
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
can't support this the way it is because
 
00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
I think it has too much bias potential
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I think it can be corrected to reach
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
what that guy was trying to get to that
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
everyone in that school should be
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
checked so as a stand I'd be happy to
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
work with someone uh on retain or uh we
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
work or bring back but I can't support
 
00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
it uh as a OTP as it is uh chairman
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you representative
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
um responding to representative lakers's
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
question about how would you revise it
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this is the complete
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
language that doesn't address the
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
definition of a group but I think an
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
amendment that says something like
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
nothing in this law shall be used to
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
require an individual to have a records
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
check distinct from the group calendar
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
would address some of the concerns that
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
are being raised that you can't say I
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know that this person and Target
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
that person so I would concur with the
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we retain it it seems
 
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.609 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we retain it it seems
like

00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concern that needs to
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
be addressed and also a lot of support
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
for being more complete in the kids
 
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.589 align:start position:0%
for being more complete in the kids
safety

00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
thank you any further representative
 
00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you any further representative
luno

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
luno
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um and
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think representative Damon
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
brings up a really important Point
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
offers uh you know a suggestion but but
 
00:46:16.089 --> 00:46:16.099 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
retaining this would allow more people
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
to sort of offer suggestions I think
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
represent Damon has a good one but there
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
may be others as well
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you know coming from the school
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
administrators Association uh uh
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
possibly coming from other associations
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
as well but also I think very important
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
was a point that that um that Captain
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
Muzzy and Ms J
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um mentioned that that really before
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
even after you know even if this is in
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
law uh final approval really comes from
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the FBI which which which have to take a
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
look at and um and before anything is
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
done is subject to their final Authority
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
um to doing this kind of thing and I
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
think as representative Woodcock has
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a lot of you know
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
question about what's being meant for
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
this or could be interpreted different
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
ways uh um and you know I think having
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
having some sort of mutual you know
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that that that can be
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
developed with the stakeholders involved
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
but also and and I think Captain Muzzy
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
said well you know the FBI doesn't
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily pre-approve uh things but we
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
could take a look at what other states
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
have done and what other approved
 
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.950 align:start position:0%
have done and what other approved
language

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
um has been done and really you know get
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
to get to the bottom of this and and get
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
something that that you know we can we
 
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:47.579 align:start position:0%
can put forward in a in a fashion that
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
meets everybody's needs including um
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
um uh superintendents including teachers
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
including teachers that that uh that
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
applied for employment prior to criminal
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
background check requirement and um and
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
also holds muster with the FBI
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about a superintendent
 
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.130 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about a superintendent

but if they suspect or have evidence
 
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:42.500 align:start position:0%
for information
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
suspicion for someone
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
are they going to say no I'm not going
 
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:49.580 align:start position:0%
to choose to do that it's my choice
 
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.809 align:start position:0%

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%

00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
of two sleep
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
could be is required to do it if there's
 
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.329 align:start position:0%
could be is required to do it if there's
something

00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
but I like the idea of that group of
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
people who've never been from a veterans
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
and then everybody's done
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative try
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms chern uh maybe
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative cascad you could help me
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
out if we said if there was a lot of
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
apparently a lot of thought of tying
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
this to the re-licensing uh and that
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
that would be then that wouldn't exclude
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
anyone and it wouldn't single anyone out
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that something that we could do in
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
statute or does that need to be part of
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
a collective bargaining agreement in a
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
I believe you can do that in statute
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't you know that's what I'm
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
suspecting because then the collective
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
bargaining will have to follow the laws
 
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you if you're talking about
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
recertification I I think that the
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
department has is looking into that
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
um doing background checks as part of
 
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.530 align:start position:0%
um doing background checks as part of
recertification

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
recertification
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a study committee right too
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative right
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank You does
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
anyone know what year criminal
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
the notes I have say in 1993 was enacted
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
in 2000 it was only some exceptions and
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
2017 the statute team and uh was more
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and then in 2018 it became
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
Russia Tanner so not to date myself too
 
00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.730 align:start position:0%
Russia Tanner so not to date myself too
much

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.170 align:start position:0%
much
but

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.370 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
I started teaching Back in 1970 and I
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
remember getting
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
background checks in fact we even had to
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
have a chest x-ray at the time because
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
of tuberculosis
 
00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:58.849 align:start position:0%
of tuberculosis
um

00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I think it's been going on a long
 
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
time I I also want to mention that let's
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
say you're a superintendent
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
if you have people that have not had
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
background checks that's kind of on you
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
and on your school district because in
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
statute every hire every substitute
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
every bus driver every
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
um person who's a designated volunteer
 
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.930 align:start position:0%
um person who's a designated volunteer
uh

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
has anybody that's working with kids in
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
a public school system upon hiring has
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
to undergo the background checks at this
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
point so let's say you have Mr Jones uh
 
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:44.300 align:start position:0%
that you suspect is doing some foul play
 
00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:47.420 align:start position:0%
if this is what it's actually intended
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
the consequence of this if you do a
 
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
background check unless he's been caught
 
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
and arrested which you probably would
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
know right away
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
the background checks are not going to
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
tell you anything because they only tell
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
you after the fact after somebody's been
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
arrested and convicted
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
um a few years ago they they had a
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem at a school district where and I
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh near me
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um where a person had been convict had
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
been found
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes found guilty of uh assault within a
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
school district and actually
 
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.970 align:start position:0%
school district and actually
um

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
did a negotiation to get it down to a
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which then wasn't carried
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
over to the next school that that person
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
went to and I was trying to look in the
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the section I know that that's been
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
addressed in the criminal background
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
check section of 189 uh in our in our
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
statute book but I just didn't it's got
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
tons of annotations if anyone would care
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
to read through it but I think we really
 
00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:56.660 align:start position:0%
need to have somebody
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
do some work on this bill and you know
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks are like I'm
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
really think that anybody that works
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
with kids uh in an educational setting
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
needs to have one so
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
I I would vote for retain if if I recall
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
the employment background checks that
 
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:17.900 align:start position:0%
the district does they get a complete
 
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.690 align:start position:0%
the district does they get a complete
picture

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:19.700 align:start position:0%
picture
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
including misdemeanors now so that those
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
types of situations could be could be
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
caught representative luno thank you and
 
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
and and and I think that's that's it's
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
an important thing to know that that
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is called a criminal history
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
records check so not only does it
 
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.290 align:start position:0%
records check so not only does it
include

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.130 align:start position:0%
include
um

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:40.910 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
um misdemeanors and felonies where where
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
someone has been found guilty but also
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
where someone has been found not guilty
 
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.829 align:start position:0%
where someone has been found not guilty
um

00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
and um and also it's it's I believe it's
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
multi-state and that's why the FBI is
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
involved there's also such a thing as a
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire only criminal records
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
check and um
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that I don't
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
think this this bill is is about but but
 
00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:13.460 align:start position:0%
um and and potentially that goes back
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know further in time than than when
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
this um uh was on I believe anybody can
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
um can
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
um fill out paperwork to get a New
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only uh uh criminal uh
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
background check but uh but for the for
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
the multi-state only certain authorized
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh uh officials authorized by law and
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
subject to the uh the approval of the
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
FBI can can have access to these records
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's why you know why why Dr
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
cascadden talks about the difficulty in
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
the portability of these from District
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
to District because they're not portable
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um so so on uh you know the more I think
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
we we've we've you know debated and
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
talked about this and um and and and
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
then one of the comments from
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Corvette cordelli
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
um made me remember the um the the study
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
the the representative McGuire's study
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee that really is looking at it
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
what what is it with these criminal
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
background check I mean sorry criminal
 
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
history record checks and how can they
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
be more effective and how can they be
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
used properly that that I think all the
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
more reason to uh to retain this and um
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
and and work closely with with that with
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
that committee that I'm not even sure if
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's been named of uh I I think
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd and I looked at this
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
maybe shortly after the the hearing back
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
in January and um and we weren't able to
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
find any any record of it being named
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
but uh but there's a lot to this and and
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and I and there's a lot of people I
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
think with with with interest and and
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
um you know based on the number of bills
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
that we had that were in this area last
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
session uh culminating with
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
um Bill to hey let's study this so
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all I got there okay thank
 
00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all I got there okay thank
you

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Woodcock then maybe
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
we'll um actually there's a question of
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
you chair sure
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um in your dialogue with you and
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative luno I just wanted to
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
follow up on those I'd written the
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
question I heard it uh on the uh you
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
said that the uh department is working
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
now and I'm assuming maybe as the
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
committed representative Luna was
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
talking about uh do you know if if the
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
part of that over overreach is going to
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
also include those that are grandfather
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
without realize the thing or research
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um with that go back and and uh handle
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
the concern that the superintendent from
 
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
godstone had that those that never had
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
an initial you know if that's in there
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
it represent a fort
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one issue I would
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
like to raise in this discussion is
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
one issue I would like to raise in this
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
discussion it's been touched on in
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
various ways but you need to think about
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
it very specifically and several of you
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
have had the positions of supervising
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
groups of people schools whatever and
 
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:32.180 align:start position:0%
it comes down to
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated substantiated
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
allegations and things like that which
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
when they get into school go from one
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
end to the other like that and how do
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
you quell them and you plow them with
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
information accurate honest information
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
some come in and said Mr Ford did such
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
and such over in that town last weekend
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
it was terrible and he ought to be fired
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
how do you find out
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
it will go around the school go home
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
come to the school board and be back out
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
on the street before your principal or
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent or president or whatever
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
has a chance to call the police station
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
find out because that would be a
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
background check in some will form or
 
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.150 align:start position:0%
background check in some will form or
another

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
and you need to have as a manager the
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
ability to manage the people you're
 
00:58:26.089 --> 00:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
enough thank you
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
um if there I think we've uh had a good
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
discussion on on this bill uh
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
um but uh again we'll uh hopefully
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd will be uh back soon
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
so maybe in the meantime
 
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:45.740 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to move to uh House Bill 427
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh relative public comment and inquiry
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
during school board meetings
 
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.690 align:start position:0%
during school board meetings
um

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
um and I will uh
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
I do have an amendment that I would like
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
years

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
so as this is going around
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
um a number of us had talked about this
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
um original bill
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and had questions about uh some of
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
the things in the bill the uh
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
asking of questions of board members
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
during public comment uh requiring
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
answers requiring answers within a
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
certain period of time
 
01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:18.530 align:start position:0%
certain period of time
Etc

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.849 align:start position:0%
Etc
um

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
so as a reaction to that and the
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
conversations I had I came up with uh
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment that basically replaces
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
um and simply
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
does a couple of things right now the
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
current statute says the public comment
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
period shall be for no less than 30
 
01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
period shall be for no less than 30
minutes

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
um I think we had a lot of discussion
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
when we first heard this bill last year
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
about that requirement
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
um what I uh went ahead and indicated
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
was that public comment periods should
 
01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.910 align:start position:0%
was that public comment periods should
be

01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
allowed so that the public could address
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
items on the agenda before they're
 
01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:08.299 align:start position:0%
actually voted on taken up by the board
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
and also non-agend items could be the
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
subject of a public comment and I know
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
in some cases that has not been the case
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
I revised the 30-minute requirement to
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
allow earlier completion if there was no
 
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and that speakers uh be given three
 
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.530 align:start position:0%
um and that speakers uh be given three
minutes

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
um to uh to speak
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
similar to some of our ground rules here
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the house so um
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
the bill and the amendment are open for
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
represent Balboni oh yes thank you it's
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment
 
01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:57.950 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment
um

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
it says uh you have public comment
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
periods shall be provided for public
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
input for agenda items before board
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
action is taken and shall also be
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
provided for non-agendant items of
 
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
community interest
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and then it says each public comment
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
period is your thought in this bill that
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
I know having been on a school board
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's multiple items on the agenda
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
that are action items I use trying to
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
say that any time before you actually
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
take a vote for each individual item
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
that you would have to have a public
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
comment period
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah that wasn't my intent to say
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
that I think a public comment period at
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the meeting as you know
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
some some board some uh do
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
um to address any coming agenda item
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient but I know
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
um in a prior District where I was they
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
they did have public comment before each
 
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.049 align:start position:0%
they did have public comment before each
uh

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
um agenda item that was to be uh acted
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
upon so I think that would be a local
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
decision by the school board
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thanks
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah the question on the amendment is
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
this does this require school boards to
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
hold two public comment periods each of
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
no less than 30 minutes or could um
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
could all of those comments both on
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
agenda items and other items be um uh be
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
done in one common period of no less
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
than 30 minutes
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be a board option
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
um I guess I question why we need this
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill or amendment when school districts
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
have local policies that address that
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
and I would think that uh
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
school board meeting in one town is
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to differ from one in the city
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
um based on what their culture and
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
climate is and so I think it should be
 
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
left up to the local school board
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
because their policies are be in the B
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
section bdeh is one of them that kind of
 
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:11.569 align:start position:0%
section bdeh is one of them that kind of
clarifies

01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
um how they want people to behave so
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's their prerogative like their
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
choice on how they want to run their
 
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.829 align:start position:0%
choice on how they want to run their
meetings

01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
without being told how to run their
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
meetings because you know how local
 
01:04:25.089 --> 01:04:25.099 align:start position:0%
control they like to do things their way
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
in lines 25 26 27 28 is very concerning
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
in light of
 
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.410 align:start position:0%
in light of
the

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
um disruption of some public entities at
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
public meetings where members of the
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
public May file a complaint to the
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
Education so that puts him in a
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
a position of having to control
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
and discipline people
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
and when it's not his role his role is
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
an educational leader
 
01:04:59.339 --> 01:05:00.049 align:start position:0%
an educational leader
um

01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
so I don't see where that belongs there
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
either but I really think because the
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
culture is so different in each
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
Community the way that we in my school
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
board meetings with my chair is
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
definitely not going to be the way that
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
some of these any of your towns do just
 
01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
because that's the way we do things
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that's where it needs to
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
be left
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you I just mentioned it in the
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
original bill that section you referred
 
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.250 align:start position:0%
original bill that section you referred
to

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
um was was one of the concerns that we
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
tried to address with this amendment by
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
removing that yeah
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
um you ask why we need this
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that we
 
01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
are from numerous different communities
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
and including one senator who had a very
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
similar Bill to this because her
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
community was not allowing people to
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
speak and if and their communities that
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
only allowed them to speak at the very
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
end which means all votes have already
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
been taken before they even get input
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the constitu you know from the
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
townspeople so
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's why because I take it from things
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
that you've said and things that I know
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
that you ran a pretty good District
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
but you can't assume that on all
 
01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:25.339 align:start position:0%
districts in the state there are some
 
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
that do not run as well as you ran yours
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
just a comment it's disappointing to
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
know that the leaders in those districts
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's town or city
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
are not allowing that
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
a resident Damon it's very dis it's very
 
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
as I read it I think the amendment
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
vastly improves on the original Bill and
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
addresses all of the concerns I
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
originally had
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
and I personally do see purpose for the
 
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
spill precisely because of the
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
difference in the way boards and
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
communities operate and having been in
 
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:13.700 align:start position:0%
communities where
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
public participation was
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
definitely not welcomed and hard to
 
01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:21.049 align:start position:0%
definitely not welcomed and hard to
provide

01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
I think we do need this policy
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
but the amendment version of it thank
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
you representative woodcock thank you
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
chair cordelli um a couple of pieces uh
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
clearly historically we know that the
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
issue arose over the last couple years
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
through the masking covert I mean that's
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
the elephant on the table that's where
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
all this came from it didn't come from a
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
typical Schoolboy mayor Temple day at
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
Temple school town over the last 20
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
years for the most part
 
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
um uh but the reality is I I think if
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
the amount hasn't been put in right it's
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
just I mean it's like it's a discussion
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
but you haven't actually correct okay
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay I I agree with representative Damon
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
that the amendment's a whole lot better
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
than the original could really concise
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
um I do I do have one surprise and I do
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
have one concern about it however
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
um and and that is the part that talks
 
01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:10.990 align:start position:0%
um and and that is the part that talks
about

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:13.339 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items of community interest
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh I say that for two reasons
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
um one that one it doesn't
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
it opens the door to anything
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh by anyone and not necessarily School
 
01:08:24.179 --> 01:08:25.729 align:start position:0%
uh by anyone and not necessarily School
related

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:27.980 align:start position:0%
um and having uh
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
our uh meeting tomorrow tomorrow night
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
in Conway I'm sure there'll be several
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
non-school related items uh uh there but
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
Mike that's my concern uh rather than
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
cordelli in the amendment uh if we if
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
that pot wasn't there it makes a whole
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
lot of uh think to me and I think that
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative leak is a point about the
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
the public comment after the Bill's
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
already been voted what Gazette you know
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
I agree with I think that a good job on
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
this client I just like that that pile
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
of non-agenda items of Q AHS that really
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
really makes me nervous because that
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
opens the door for all kinds of things
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
happening uh in that in that meeting it
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the school policy
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that is on the agenda
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely which is an open door or
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
anything is that's just me thank you
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I I totally agree that I think
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know the the issues that we've
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
seen the bills that have come through
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
about school board meetings and trying
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
to control school boards has been in a
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
direct uh reaction
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
to the covet and masking and vaccination
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the brouhaha that came in many many
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
local school boards I know my local
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
school board used to meet in the music
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
room in a nice small area there were
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
people that came that were rude
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes but for the most part it was
 
01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:52.100 align:start position:0%
you know a well-run meeting
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
I went after covet when we were meeting
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
again I go it's now in the gymnasium
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
where the school board is probably
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
almost as far away as that back wall uh
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
from the seating area where the the
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
public sits and they have microphones
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
now with somebody there Manning the
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
microphones to make sure that you know
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
people have a chance to talk it's it's
 
01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:17.330 align:start position:0%
people have a chance to talk it's it's
really

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.229 align:start position:0%
really
um

01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
I think caused a lot of communities a
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of struggle a lot of angst and I
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
think that as Dr casterian has said
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
you know our communities are all
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
different and they have to just like the
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
select men's meetings are all different
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh when you have you know 500 people in
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
your town versus you know thousands tens
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
of thousands you're going to have a
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
different meeting and a different venue
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and I think it's local control I think
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
we have to let the local community do it
 
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
and when there's a problem like there
 
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.729 align:start position:0%
and when there's a problem like there
isn't

01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
some places
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
um an election's coming up next week and
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
I think that election is going to uh be
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
the people's voice on electing people to
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
the school board that
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
um hopefully they've the the people in
 
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
the community have voiced their opinion
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
very strongly and I think they have in
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
some about how poorly the school board
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
meetings have been run and things will
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
change that's how democracy works and
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
because we have local control and
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
because we have our community public
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
schools with local
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
elected officials I I think the more
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
hands off we can be the better off I
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't think prescribing three minutes a
 
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
don't think prescribing three minutes a
speaker

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
um is in our purview or should be thank
 
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.090 align:start position:0%
um is in our purview or should be thank
you

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh represent Belcher thank you
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would I would just want to
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
get to the heart of this a little bit I
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
think what we're really looking at here
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
is the is the right of the people to
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
petition their government for grievances
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
that is right they have by the
 
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.050 align:start position:0%
that is right they have by the
Constitution

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
if their local school board is not
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
giving them that adequate access to them
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
they then have the right to come to a
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
higher level such as us to see if we can
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
now I think this is actually a very
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
light touch on the issue and I hope to
 
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
assuage some of the concerns that have
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
been brought up about things getting out
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
of hand with unscheduled public comment
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
because this still prescribes the local
 
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
school board the ability to limit
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
to three minutes per person and it has
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to limit the 30 minutes
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
overall for a public comment period so
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get way out of whack
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
with this this is actually significantly
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
preserving local control while providing
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
just that small amount of ability for
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
people to have that right to petition
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
their local school board for grievances
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ford
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
I just like to remind everyone in this
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
conversation or frequently overlooked
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
fact that local control is subject to
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
all state and federal law
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
you're not free to do anything you want
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
under local control you have to abide by
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
state and federal law
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
given that you have local control
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that some groups
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't sometimes push the edges of that
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
and again some of the members of the
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
community get exercised and then polite
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
granted that it's hard to control
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden did
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:09.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:11.330 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'd like to
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
address where representative Ford
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
um uh talked about with respect to local
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
control and being subject to um to state
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
and federal law so let's say this let's
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
say the amendment here was to um uh to
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
become law I mean I do agree that the
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
amendment is less onerous than the bill
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
but would that mean that that that that
 
01:14:33.239 --> 01:14:34.090 align:start position:0%
but would that mean that that that that
that

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:34.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
I either as a school board member or a
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
member of the public that may be in the
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
meeting would need to sit through up to
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
30 minutes listening to at a minimum
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
three minute bytes of people spewing
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxx messages anti-master it's all
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
about book bands anti-trans comments
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
stuff like that that I need to um to sit
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
through and hear it and if I was board
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
chair that I would uh I would be limited
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
be prevented by state law from um uh
 
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:11.900 align:start position:0%
from uh interrupting and stop thing
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
these sorts of vile comments
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
say the masking comments were uh were
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
vile what about anti-trans comments
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the board chair would
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
have a discretion
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
um uh with any personal comments like
 
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
that but um current law is that
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
current law is that uh the uh comment
 
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
period is no less than 30 minutes so
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's a base base amount what the
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
amendment does is say and if there is no
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
public comment uh Beyond 10 minutes they
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
can go on to the next agenda item but Mr
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
chair what what this is really doing
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
though is is requiring the the school
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
board to to not to not limit comments to
 
01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:09.860 align:start position:0%
just agenda items uh but but include
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items which as represented
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock has said opens the door wide
 
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
open to anything I want to talk about
 
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:23.540 align:start position:0%
including spewing anti-trans anti-lgbtq
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and every board member every
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
administrator and everybody there and
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
everybody watching is going to have to
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
sit through that in in minimum
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
three-minute chunks up to no up to um to
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
a half hour and and restrict because
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's state law restrict the board
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
chair's ability to to rein in that
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
meeting and those comments
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think that we are going to
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh to see that I don't think that uh
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
public comment periods now
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
um couldn't someone get up during a
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
public comment period now and spew all
 
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
sorts of things now I don't see any
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
difference from what happens now to
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
what's proposed in this legislation uh
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
Belcher can stop it but thank you Mr
 
01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.689 align:start position:0%
Belcher can stop it but thank you Mr
chair

01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
and I I I'm not sure I I I'm in reality
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
because I have to say this but yes we we
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
members of government
 
01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:24.659 align:start position:0%
do have to sit there and listen to
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the public wants to say if it's
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
not a violation of Law and we have to
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
take it
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
oh representative Tanner
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I just I guess I want to go
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
back to the redress of grievances uh
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
issue and that the fact that the public
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
school board meeting is a public
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
business meeting

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
um the school board at and I'm I'll be
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
really surprised if this is that the
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
school board members and the school
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
board as as a whole has the ability to
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
accept written complaints written
 
01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.209 align:start position:0%
accept written complaints written
petitions

01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
petitions
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
um can be spoken to on a on a private
 
01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
um can be spoken to on a on a private
basis

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is allowing a public
 
01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is allowing a public
forum

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
forum
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
attack address
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
the school board rather than go through
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh if they have a legitimate complaint
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
um or just like here I mean people can
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
come and testify they can also put it on
 
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
come and testify they can also put it on
uh

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
line they can send us emails I mean who
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't get 100 emails
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
um you know you you have all different
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
ways to do it you don't have to
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
reach down to the local level
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
give a one-size-fits all for the whole
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where you have
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
rural areas urban areas you've got
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
different areas of the state with all
 
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:07.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of different culture
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
to prescribe something like this I I
 
01:19:10.199 --> 01:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
to prescribe something like this I I
really

01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know don't like the heavy hand
 
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.649 align:start position:0%
you know don't like the heavy hand
so

01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
um I I think there may be some way to to
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
address this but basically I don't think
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
this is where we should be
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cascadden
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I still hung up on that 30
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
minutes of something that you said
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
Representatives if there's nobody
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
at your meeting then you can proceed but
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
you really can't because yep excuse me
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
you have to publish your your meeting
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
agenda 24 hours before the meeting so
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to block off 30 minutes for
 
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing and so somebody who wants
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
to come and say something may not be
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
there at the onset but may show up five
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
minutes before that 30 minutes is done
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
so you really need to hold your meeting
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
till that full 30 minutes is has gone by
 
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.070 align:start position:0%
till that full 30 minutes is has gone by
um

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's one thing the other thing is
 
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:05.900 align:start position:0%
there are School Board policies again
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
that give the Public Authority and
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
Direction on how to file their
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
complaints how they're addressed there's
 
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
a sequence and a chain of command who do
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
you see first who do you see next if
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
you're not satisfied you go here here
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
and here but it's done to keep Law and
 
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:23.870 align:start position:0%
and here but it's done to keep Law and
Order

01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
Order
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
and civility
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
in how we're running these systems
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr boister I have two things
 
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.189 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr boister I have two things
um

01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
since you're the author of the amendment
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you would entertain
 
01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.020 align:start position:0%
uh revision of the amendment to remove
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
the part of line seven and eight that
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
reads and shall also be provided for
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
non-agenda items of community interest
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
and then I have a second
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
separate question
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah maybe when we get the full
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
committee together we can talk about
 
01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh your second comment is
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering I know we have people in
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
the audience from the New Hampshire
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
school boards Association I would love
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to hear from them
 
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
I think we heard from them during the
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
original meeting
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
um let's continue let's yes right can we
 
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
continue with the member comments
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thanks
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Ellie um I'd like to go back I
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on on what uh hope
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
said the the third time limit is issue
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I agree with Mike uh we have to sit
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
there and listen uh but we have to
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
listen to relevant comments and deal
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
with agenda items so I think that's the
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
difference like in this and that that if
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's not on the agenda if the agenda
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
item a public has the right to input I
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
like the fact that it's done before they
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
vote but but if it's not a general item
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think they should be getting a
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
free a free warrant like that I think it
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
just opens up to too much too much um
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
divisiveness uh in the school board yeah
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
School Board member I spent 20 years of
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
school board and I I'd still be sitting
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
in a meeting we had to open it up to
 
01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:12.860 align:start position:0%
anybody want to talk about anything
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:17.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
since we're still waiting for
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative lad to return why don't
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
we take a break for 15 minutes and see
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
everybody needs an update of where we
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
are here
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
it would be nice huh the first hour down
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
in division two we dealt with two bills
 
01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:31.139 align:start position:0%
one of those bills was Career Technical
 
01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
education tuition and transportation
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
they bought it and they're going to put
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
it into the legislation that's moving
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
forward that would put another 2.2
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the Career Tech for
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
each year of the biennium so a total of
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
4.4 million dollars which is needed if
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to ever get more kids
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
involved with CTE programming including
 
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
the transportation so that was a very
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
successful one and then the other bill
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
which we dealt with was the weighted
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
formula for differentiated Aid special
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
education the buying into the formula
 
01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.430 align:start position:0%
education the buying into the formula
also

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
and and so so with those the time we
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
spent this morning for that hour down
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
there is showing and those bills came
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
out of this committee unanimously and so
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
they're listening to policy and they're
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
trying to you know adjust budgeting for
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
it uh the within the hb2 they already
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
had the differentiated amount of
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
2079.89 which is the amount for
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which would
 
01:46:33.649 --> 01:46:33.659 align:start position:0%
automatically occur result of the CPI
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
and everything else
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
um that's there but they're also looking
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
now at the three categories awaited this
 
01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
uh would go from two thousand dollars to
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars to six thousand
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
dollars depending on whether category a
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
b or c c is the one where the remember
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
if they're in residential placement or
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
or a hospital placement or other
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
placements similar to that more costly b
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
as if you're in a situation where it's
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
um 80 percent or more that's uh needing
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
uh special services especially during
 
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
the course of a day so that's pretty
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
much almost full-time special education
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
that would be weighted at about four
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and then if you're less
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
than eighty percent it would be weighted
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
at the same amount that's in the in the
 
01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
bill right now so all they have to do is
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
modify that one component hb2 and I
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
think we've got that one so that was
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
good a good time down there
 
01:47:31.739 --> 01:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
good a good time down there
um

01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
I know that you all I couldn't take any
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
action and move forward here but I think
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
that when we're looking at those
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
priorities that came out of this
 
01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.430 align:start position:0%
priorities that came out of this
committee

01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
um it was an hour worth spending
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
um as soon as we have folks coming back
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
from that we'll move forward with trying
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
to exactly we will be taking a break at
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
noon time
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um for lunch
 
01:47:57.050 --> 01:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
so with that we still have uh
 
01:47:58.609 --> 01:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
representative Miler and represent
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
Tanner are now they're down there
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with other bills and we the
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
other bills coming up down there today
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid Direct
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
which is a huge bill in terms of
 
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.490 align:start position:0%
which is a huge bill in terms of
eligibility

01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I also noticed that down there today
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
we also had the staff member that's been
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
hired to take care of Senate Finance
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
Karen umberger was down there today
 
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
participating in um and so we had a
 
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
little opportunity to talk about the
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
whole budget that the governor's
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
presented and what we're after ourselves
 
01:48:31.619 --> 01:48:32.990 align:start position:0%
presented and what we're after ourselves
so

01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to wait and start our our
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
discussions unless I'm once you update
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
me a little bit uh Glenn where you were
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
or worked in terms of the bills for
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
executing today yes we uh passed over
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 204 the non-academic
 
01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
surveys we were finished with discussion
 
01:48:58.930 --> 01:48:58.940 align:start position:0%
on that at that point
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
267 we had a complete discussion on that
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh the next bill we we passed
 
01:49:11.890 --> 01:49:11.900 align:start position:0%
over completely 371 and we were
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
approaching completion of the discussion
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we can't take any action the the
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
we agreed uh if somebody's out
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
testifying down there we would not move
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
forward with any executive sessions
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
and you can rest assured that we will be
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
down there for Medicaid Direct
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
and that will be another one where we
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
won't have any time so we got to really
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
if we can get any discussion done
 
01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
further on these bills
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
um get somewhat an idea where people are
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to move that direction
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
okay motions were put on the table for
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
all those other bills uh really just
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
discussions discussions okay
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%

01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%

01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
427 yeah right okay so 451 we haven't
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
touched yet
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay let's talk about 451 now without
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
relative Charter Public School
 
01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.030 align:start position:0%
relative Charter Public School
dissolution

01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
you got an amendment
 
01:51:21.370 --> 01:51:21.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
he if we're going to be getting into the
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
business of um at some point of looking
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
into providing State Building they need
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
what's that yeah yeah I didn't have that
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
going but uh let me get the let me send
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.679 --> 01:51:51.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's enough going that
 
01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.109 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's enough going that
way

01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.119 --> 01:52:28.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:28.090 --> 01:52:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'll just sort of lay a little
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
groundwork so so so back in February
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
13th uh we held a hearing on houseboat
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
550 it was introduced by representative
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
fellows the um the the bill is
 
01:52:42.119 --> 01:52:43.270 align:start position:0%
fellows the um the the bill is
introduced

01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh provided um
 
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.850 --> 01:52:54.860 align:start position:0%
what happens to
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
assets during the dissolution of a um of
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
a chartered public school and uh
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
and um I I think following some uh some
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
fellows and I think it may have happened
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
even during the hearing that uh that it
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
seemed to be
 
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
um good to um to eliminate the policy
 
01:53:21.129 --> 01:53:21.139 align:start position:0%
part and just focus on establishing a um
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
a committee to study uh chartered school
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
dissolution and as I was just starting
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
to say the reason why this is important
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
is uh because the legislature may be
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
looking to consider down the road uh
 
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
expending uh State assets in terms of
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
building aid for uh for Charter Public
 
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
Schools and um and you know unlike
 
01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities which don't really
 
01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.770 align:start position:0%
municipalities which don't really
um

01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
well municipalities have a
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
um education for all of the children
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
that live in that in that municipality
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools don't have any
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide uh
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
to provide anything and um and I'm not
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
being critical of of Charter Public
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
Schools but uh but over the over the the
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
25-ish years that we've had Charter
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we have had a handful of
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
um of failures that resulted in
 
01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:29.060 align:start position:0%
dissolution and and subsequent
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
conversations uh particularly between
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and the
 
01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.689 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and the
department

01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:54:35.699 --> 01:54:37.669 align:start position:0%
department
um

01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
really resulted in um and yeah this week
 
01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
we need to put some some policy behind
 
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
what what happens here so so
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so Sally fellows and I are bringing
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
for I'm bringing it Forward
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
um Amendment zero six two four h which
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill with a uh with
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
a study uh committee to uh to look into
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
what would happen in the event of a uh
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
of a charter failure what would happen
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
to those assets and um and I I think
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's one of the key items that uh that
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
we need to have policy in place on
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
um uh you know at such time when the uh
 
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
when the state may consider to move
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
forward with with expending its capital
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:28.129 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:28.139 --> 01:55:29.390 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
when you put this together
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative luno did you years ago we
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
had a charter that went defunct
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
had a situation where it could have been
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
a private school I'm just can't quite
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
recall but people were chasing after
 
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.310 align:start position:0%
recall but people were chasing after
transcripts

01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
transcripts
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh graduation transcripts and trying to
 
01:55:53.330 --> 01:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
locate those eventually it had to be
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
done through doe uh
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
but that's another issue that's when uh
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
any school goes defunct
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
then what happens you know for a student
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's four years later saying I'm going
 
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
to go off to college but I have to have
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
my transcripts sent and the school is no
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
longer in existence uh how does that
 
01:56:16.619 --> 01:56:18.169 align:start position:0%
longer in existence uh how does that
occur

01:56:18.169 --> 01:56:18.179 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh that's it doesn't have to do with
 
01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
what you're doing necessarily here but
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is an issue which we've had to deal
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
with and and and the um the amendment um
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
contemplates that on page two line six
 
01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
and seven uh under the um the the duties
 
01:56:36.729 --> 01:56:36.739 align:start position:0%
of the um the committee in Roman three
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh where line six and seven on page two
 
01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
non-financial issues related to
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution including but not limited to
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh notification of closure placement of
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
students and retention of academic
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
records okay good yeah Diana and I
 
01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
recall Mr chair you and I having a
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
conversation on that uh issue we've had
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
some very wild conversations on this
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
um because kids couldn't get the records
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
in time to make it to the next semester
 
01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
um further discussion on on the
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh it's just been
 
01:57:12.119 --> 01:57:14.149 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh it's just been
mentioned

01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli uh thank you I
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
think just yesterday we passed uh uh
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislation um related to uh uh revision
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
to the Charter oversight committee
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh couldn't uh these issues be uh
 
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
addressed by uh that uh group rather
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
than a new committee
 
01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
so so let me let me take that um Mr
 
01:57:42.649 --> 01:57:42.659 align:start position:0%
chair so I think the charter oversight
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
committee and and representative Tanner
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
I think uh could weigh in on this I
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
believe is more about oversight of of
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
current operations as opposed to study
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
of new policy
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
um this is this is particularly centered
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
on study of new policy uh which I I
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
think is beyond what the um what the uh
 
01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
the oversight commission does and uh
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's it's also relevant
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
to uh to point out in the amendment
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
down on the first page sort of between
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
some between lines 15 to uh uh to 21
 
01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
where where it um uh yeah 15 or 21 where
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
it really talks about the type of
 
01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
expertise and advice that the uh that
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
the committee would be able to Garner
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
um uh from um from people connected with
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
Finance from the uh the Departments um
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
um uh charter school officer from the
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
doj's charitable trust division
 
01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:48.290 align:start position:0%
doj's charitable trust division
um

01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh Das
 
01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and of course and it's got
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
some you know standard language that we
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
put into a lot of committees you know
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
not limited to or other any other people
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
with relevant
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
um background and expertise so I I think
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
it probably goes beyond what the what
 
01:59:08.089 --> 01:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
the oversight does
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
question is there any reason why when
 
01:59:15.649 --> 01:59:15.659 align:start position:0%
there's uh when when a school dissolves
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
that all the school records are just
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
returned to their owners
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
or is there something about having to
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
store them
 
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
well there's the issue the official
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
records too uh if if you're applying to
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
a college they don't want it coming from
 
01:59:37.089 --> 01:59:37.099 align:start position:0%
the student they want it coming from the
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
issuing Institution
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
yeah the department we had a little less
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
session with the Department would be
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
retaining those records yes we did
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's the one I was trying to recall
 
01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:55.820 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that that is a a real issue
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah in colleges when they use
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
that too you're Mike
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
in college is when they do that
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
typically they find another college that
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
agrees to take the whole body of records
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
and they become the institution that
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
Services those needs for official
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
transcripts with seals and all that sort
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
of thing to go out for the acceptance to
 
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
other colleges whatever
 
02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.129 align:start position:0%
other colleges whatever
yeah

02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I notice and I'm
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
glad you took the first part out of this
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
because I had problems with the nearest
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:00:30.599 --> 02:00:31.990 align:start position:0%
public school
District

02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
charter schools of course receive kids
 
02:00:36.410 --> 02:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
from various districts
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and the nearest
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
you know why why is that the nearest
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
response you know that that's online of
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
the original Bill line six and then
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
again on line 16.
 
02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:52.250 align:start position:0%
again on line 16.
yeah

02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that and that's why we're not we're
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
not embracing the um the policy from the
 
02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced it's that that would
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
really be
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
um something for the commission to the
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
from the committee for the study
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee to dive into and recommend
 
02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.470 align:start position:0%
committee to dive into and recommend
okay

02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.149 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
um so we've been in discussion here
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
um where is yes represent Tanner I just
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate uh what representative
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
Uno said I don't think the legislative
 
02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
oversight committee their job is to
 
02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:24.709 align:start position:0%
oversight committee their job is to
really

02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
um look at the functioning of schools
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
the approval of charter schools get to
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
get a report to them from the State
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and then issue a
 
02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:36.530 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and then issue a
report

02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
um to the House and Senate education
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
committees it it doesn't deal with
 
02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
the specifics of of this wouldn't this
 
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I don't think be in their
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
purview at all
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
okay so what I'd like to do because it's
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the first time we're seeing this I'd
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
like to take a caucus for about five
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
minutes here and so I can talk with
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
folks about this and and find out where
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
we want to go
 
02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:05.629 align:start position:0%

03:41:09.290 --> 03:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
Myler and second by representative luno
 
03:41:11.090 --> 03:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the maker of the
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
motion no I think we've had enough
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
conversation here
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.290 --> 03:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so so there
 
03:41:26.330 --> 03:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
um there was we did have I think
 
03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:27.590 align:start position:0%
um there was we did have I think
substantial

03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
um uh good debate and discussion on 267
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
and um and and probably worth uh worth
 
03:41:37.070 --> 03:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing the YouTube video and I know
 
03:41:42.849 --> 03:41:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.050 --> 03:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
but but
 
03:41:47.710 --> 03:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
um I think if if if we're to summarize
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
at least you know my notes into three
 
03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:52.190 align:start position:0%
at least you know my notes into three
points

03:41:52.190 --> 03:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
um I think the um the super the sponsors
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and and in particular the
 
03:41:59.450 --> 03:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
superintendent Goffstown
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
um uh Brian balke
 
03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
um have um have I think made a
 
03:42:06.889 --> 03:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
reasonable case that um that that there
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
should be something that provides an
 
03:42:12.170 --> 03:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a um for only to get the
 
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
term right a more frequent or recurring
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
basis to
 
03:42:18.290 --> 03:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
um to to perform criminal history
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
records checks and um and that um that I
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
think that we also had some discussion
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
that um that the language that's in the
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
bill right now with respect to
 
03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
um uh having districts conduct these
 
03:42:37.729 --> 03:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
these a more frequent recurring
 
03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
um records checks on quote on any group
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
of employees maybe that could be worked
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
on a little bit so that we get a better
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and that's the second
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
point and then the third Point
 
03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to lay out is that um both
 
03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
Captain Muzzy and and Christine J uh
 
03:42:58.729 --> 03:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
from the uh from criminal records at the
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety uh also talked
 
03:43:03.410 --> 03:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
about how
 
03:43:07.130 --> 03:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
language like this you can't just enact
 
03:43:10.370 --> 03:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
it in law before for to make it ready
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
for implementation it has to get
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
um approved by the um the Federal Bureau
 
03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
of Investigation and and that um and
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
that they um would be able to help us
 
03:43:26.030 --> 03:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
maybe take a look at at similar language
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's been approved in other states and
 
03:43:32.090 --> 03:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
um uh and and I think through through
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill we'd also be able to
 
03:43:34.439 --> 03:43:35.690 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill we'd also be able to
develop

03:43:35.690 --> 03:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
develop
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
um you know Mutual Amendment language in
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the school
 
03:43:41.210 --> 03:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
administration Association which I think
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
has indicated General support for um for
 
03:43:47.150 --> 03:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
for changes in the policy uh but also
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
other advocacy groups too you know and
 
03:43:53.450 --> 03:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
and certainly working with the FBI uh
 
03:43:55.729 --> 03:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
and getting some language that um that
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we feel strongly is going to be
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
acceptable to them so those I think are
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
the the the reasons in my well I think
 
03:44:06.050 --> 03:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
retaining would would make a lot of
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
sense right here representative woodcock
 
03:44:10.610 --> 03:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I would just like to
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
add to representative piece the other
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
part I thought was substantive with the
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
fact that we hadn't identified who would
 
03:44:17.809 --> 03:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the payment of the
 
03:44:20.450 --> 03:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
the fee for the school district that
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
they're asking for or the employee I
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
think somewhere in the retain the retain
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
that has to be addressed as well thank
 
03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:29.269 align:start position:0%
that has to be addressed as well thank
you

03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.650 --> 03:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli thank you
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that this there was agreement
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
I think that this is an important area
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
um and needs to be addressed uh I think
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
that the bill before us
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
provides for
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
um work in collective bargaining it
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
prevents any uh individual from being
 
03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
singled out
 
03:44:59.450 --> 03:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
I think that we should move forward with
 
03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
this I know that the FBI has to concur
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
with the language and I believe the
 
03:45:09.170 --> 03:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
testimony was that um
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
something would have to be passed before
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
the FBI would actually do that review so
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think we need to go ahead and pass it
 
03:45:22.849 --> 03:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you Mr chair and
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
and you know I I I I generally agree
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
with with what was said with regards to
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
the importance of the bill I just um uh
 
03:45:35.929 --> 03:45:35.939 align:start position:0%
think pertaining it would would allow us
 
03:45:39.170 --> 03:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
to um to to you know bring forward
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
rather than a no recommendation which I
 
03:45:44.809 --> 03:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
don't think tells the the right story on
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
on 267 bring forward a a um a strong
 
03:45:51.889 --> 03:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation from this committee based
 
03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
on the testimony that that we heard
 
03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
um including that from Captain luzzy and
 
03:46:01.610 --> 03:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and also recognize the work that that
 
03:46:03.769 --> 03:46:03.779 align:start position:0%
um that is is going to be done I think
 
03:46:06.410 --> 03:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
in parallel with this through the um
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
through representative McGuire's um
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
um of criminal records check uh uh study
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee and uh we had a number of
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
bills on uh related in in this in this
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
school safety area last session
 
03:46:25.130 --> 03:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm surprised this didn't come up
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
then but uh but I you know I think we've
 
03:46:30.830 --> 03:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
got a really good opportunity uh because
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
we all recognize the importance of this
 
03:46:37.490 --> 03:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
to um to to put something together and
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
bring something forward that the people
 
03:46:43.010 --> 03:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire can uh can you know see
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's important because we together
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden just a comment we
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
had a great discussion on this if you
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
get a um a reason you know a way to to
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
watch it but
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill as it is is yet another
 
03:47:04.849 --> 03:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate so that means you're
 
03:47:06.410 --> 03:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know somebody's got to come up with
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
the money in the district
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
so it's another unfunded mandate
 
03:47:16.250 --> 03:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
is it unfunded if it says may require
 
03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
and how are you going to be able to do
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity or follow Title IX if
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's a May how are you going to pick and
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
choose that we that was part of our
 
03:47:26.279 --> 03:47:34.010 align:start position:0%
choose that we that was part of our
discussion

03:47:34.010 --> 03:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:36.899 align:start position:0%
it's done by district and so a district
 
03:47:39.050 --> 03:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
May appropriate the dollars in a budget
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
for that purpose as a whole
 
03:47:44.450 --> 03:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
now if they choose not to do it then
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
everybody within the district is treated
 
03:47:46.439 --> 03:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
everybody within the district is treated
equally

03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
equally
 
03:47:51.610 --> 03:47:51.620 align:start position:0%
Melissa is a reason it should be done
 
03:47:55.190 --> 03:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
your District hasn't budgeted funding
 
03:47:55.200 --> 03:47:56.750 align:start position:0%

move on to pass and offer Amendment zero
 
03:50:35.570 --> 03:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.250 --> 03:50:39.260 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion made ought to pass
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
and uh with Amendment
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
what was the number on that
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
zero seven four one H and second by
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.750 --> 03:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli you're recognize
 
03:50:59.150 --> 03:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
um I think we had uh quite a bit of
 
03:51:01.250 --> 03:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
discussion with this
 
03:51:03.889 --> 03:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
um I think there was a lot of agreement
 
03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
that there were problems with the
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh the amendment uh
 
03:51:12.889 --> 03:51:12.899 align:start position:0%
provides for uh public input before
 
03:51:16.370 --> 03:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
action is taken by the board uh it also
 
03:51:20.690 --> 03:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh provides that the public may offer
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
comment on non-agend items and it
 
03:51:27.969 --> 03:51:27.979 align:start position:0%
revises the current statute
 
03:51:31.490 --> 03:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
that says public comment for at least 30
 
03:51:34.370 --> 03:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
minutes in the amendment we say that
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
there are no speakers
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the entire 30 minutes they can end
 
03:51:42.190 --> 03:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
it earlier and that
 
03:51:45.130 --> 03:51:45.140 align:start position:0%
speakers should be allowed to speak for
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Woodcock and then
 
03:51:54.359 --> 03:51:55.729 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Woodcock and then
representative

03:51:55.729 --> 03:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh chairman uh
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cordell is correct
 
03:52:03.530 --> 03:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
this his Amendment does make a great
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
stride to improve the bill
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
um however uh as I commented in the
 
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier on and I'll do it now
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
since the fishing on the floor the fact
 
03:52:15.050 --> 03:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
that we opened it up to non-agendal
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
items of community interest is just open
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
a wide array of of topics and uh they
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
have no value or substance to the school
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
board it could be about anything Grant
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
the rate of anything I'm not suggesting
 
03:52:29.809 --> 03:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
that maybe other forms in a community
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
for those topics but clearly not the
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
school board the fact that they have in
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that you can address
 
03:52:38.929 --> 03:52:38.939 align:start position:0%
the topic before is voted I think that's
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
substantively excellent idea but opening
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
it wide the knowledge and items of
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
community interest I think it's a killer
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
on this and I'd be happy to support this
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
amendment without that line thank you
 
03:52:52.990 --> 03:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative a representative
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah thank you very much Mr
 
03:52:58.010 --> 03:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
03:53:00.530 --> 03:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so the the question question I've got
 
03:53:03.170 --> 03:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
is with respect to
 
03:53:03.180 --> 03:53:04.550 align:start position:0%
is with respect to
the

03:53:04.550 --> 03:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment and it's more of a
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
procedural question if this amendment
 
03:53:13.250 --> 03:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
and the and a subsequent vote of ought
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
to pass is amended were to fail and
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and let's say the bill came out of
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee without recommendation
 
03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:28.610 align:start position:0%
committee without recommendation
um

03:53:28.610 --> 03:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
would the amendment have any greater
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
standing than any other amendment that
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
might be offered on the floor yes
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
all right so could you explain how that
 
03:53:43.190 --> 03:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
well seeing it was approved by the
 
03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:44.330 align:start position:0%
well seeing it was approved by the
committee

03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:53:46.370 --> 03:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
and no other Amendment on the floor will
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
have been approved by anybody until
 
03:53:50.450 --> 03:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
approved on the floor so we take all
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been approved in
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee first
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay as part of that report
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
that where we end up with that whether
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
it was yeah it'd have to be not to pass
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay and I think based on an earlier
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we did I did check with the
 
03:54:11.809 --> 03:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
clerk and so the one recommendation
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass is amended with
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
the approved Amendment right right and
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
so the so the amendment would be the
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
first thing taken up the same way it
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
would be with a with any other committee
 
03:54:26.090 --> 03:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes okay yeah great thank you
 
03:54:28.130 --> 03:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it's important to
 
03:54:38.689 --> 03:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
allow the public to speak on other
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
things not on the agenda I think it's an
 
03:54:44.809 --> 03:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
assumption that it will be totally
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
um extraneous to the school board and
 
03:54:49.809 --> 03:54:49.819 align:start position:0%
not something that they're interested in
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
I also think that this amendment as
 
03:54:53.939 --> 03:54:55.250 align:start position:0%
I also think that this amendment as
written

03:54:55.250 --> 03:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:54:58.969 --> 03:54:58.979 align:start position:0%
should we have another I'll say covid
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily coveted but some
 
03:55:05.150 --> 03:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
thing that gets parents upset
 
03:55:08.410 --> 03:55:08.420 align:start position:0%
this lays out
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
a method
 
03:55:12.769 --> 03:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
that can be followed and be being
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
followed so that when things come up it
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
will help keep from getting those heated
 
03:55:24.530 --> 03:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
arguments that we saw during covid
 
03:55:27.130 --> 03:55:27.140 align:start position:0%
where parents were not allowed to speak
 
03:55:30.170 --> 03:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
where parents were very concerned about
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
a particular topic which wasn't on the
 
03:55:35.150 --> 03:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
agenda but which was very important to a
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
large number of parents and when they
 
03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak that's when tempers rise
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's when people get upset if you let
 
03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
them have their say after all it's three
 
03:55:47.819 --> 03:55:48.830 align:start position:0%
them have their say after all it's three
minutes

03:55:48.830 --> 03:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:55:51.530 --> 03:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and it's 30 minutes total it's not like
 
03:55:53.150 --> 03:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to be there all day and not
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
get to your business it's 30 minutes
 
03:55:57.050 --> 03:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's three minutes
 
03:55:59.210 --> 03:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
we have people we have public hearings
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
here and we have people who come in some
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
of them are regulars who are not always
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
Jermaine to the bill or to well let's
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
see speaking about aliens and abduction
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
and various other things and we smile
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
and we let them talk and we say hey we
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
say time is up thank you for your
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
testimony right
 
03:56:26.689 --> 03:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
and we don't say blah so I think
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's important I think it's very
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
important for the public to know that
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
they're being heard whether or not the
 
03:56:36.530 --> 03:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
school board then agrees
 
03:56:38.929 --> 03:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
with what they have to say or disagrees
 
03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
at least they know they've had their say
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I think we will be much less likely
 
03:56:47.090 --> 03:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
enacted if we ignite enact this whole
 
03:56:50.929 --> 03:56:50.939 align:start position:0%
thing as it is the amendment
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
to have disruptive school board meetings
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the future if some other
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
thing whatever it is we can't foresee it
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
comes up like covid came up that gets
 
03:57:05.809 --> 03:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
you know parents as a whole upset about
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
whatever this gives them a chance to
 
03:57:11.229 --> 03:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
speak their mind and be done
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just to just add
 
03:57:20.570 --> 03:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
on top of that a little bit I I want to
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
go on record saying that because the
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution places restrictions on
 
03:57:28.250 --> 03:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
government and provides or outlines
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
rights of people I don't actually think
 
03:57:33.530 --> 03:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
we as a body or School boards have any
 
03:57:36.530 --> 03:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
Authority whatsoever to limit what
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
grievances uh people are allowed to
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Balboni
 
03:57:50.210 --> 03:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
um yes I have a just a a question about
 
03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
um so it says no less than 30 minutes
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
but if more people want to speak then
 
03:57:59.450 --> 03:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
would go beyond that 30 minutes anybody
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
who wanted to speak would have three
 
03:58:03.050 --> 03:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
minutes I mean it doesn't really say
 
03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
anything about control after you know it
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
says in terms of the time limits below
 
03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
it does say reasonable controls there
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really
 
03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a time limit and it also
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about
 
03:58:23.570 --> 03:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
um each person only get one three-minute
 
03:58:24.910 --> 03:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
period or
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's a little fuzzy on that and it's
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh Lucas
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's where you leave that
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
discretion to the school board if they
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
see a whole lot of people who are really
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
animated and want to give them a chance
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
they can say yes on the other hand they
 
03:58:50.330 --> 03:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
can say we're not going to get to our
 
03:58:52.610 --> 03:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
committee meeting let us schedule
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
another meeting for that particular
 
03:58:55.080 --> 03:58:56.090 align:start position:0%
another meeting for that particular
thing

03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
we will need now need to do our business
 
03:58:58.140 --> 03:58:59.269 align:start position:0%
we will need now need to do our business
meeting

03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:59:02.410 --> 03:59:02.420 align:start position:0%
and I have seen this done in my town
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
and we didn't get excited angry anything
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
the school board meetings ran very well
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
because they listened they heard and
 
03:59:14.330 --> 03:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
they said let us schedule
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
a time when you can come and ask us
 
03:59:19.490 --> 03:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
whatever and they did that they listened
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that's part of what's
 
03:59:23.450 --> 03:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
important here so that would be the at
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the school board to
 
03:59:26.399 --> 03:59:27.710 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the school board to
say

03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to hear you tonight or
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
no we're going to wait and hear you in a
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
week and
 
03:59:36.889 --> 03:59:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you I I
 
03:59:41.929 --> 03:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
can't find anything in the bill but is
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
there anything about that the the
 
03:59:43.800 --> 03:59:45.110 align:start position:0%
there anything about that the the
speaker

03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
03:59:47.330 --> 03:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
um should be a resident of or have
 
03:59:49.130 --> 03:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
something to do with the particular
 
03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
School District that they're speaking at
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
or could someone from North Conway come
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
down to Manchester and give their
 
03:59:57.239 --> 04:00:01.330 align:start position:0%
down to Manchester and give their
opinion

04:00:01.330 --> 04:00:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.090 --> 04:00:04.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
my experience when I I chaired the
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
select board in my community and it's on
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
city council elsewhere is that the
 
04:00:16.010 --> 04:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
policies which we established as a local
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
board be it select board or city council
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
and we may adopt Robert's Rules which we
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
did in this particular Community here in
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:00:28.130 --> 04:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
and Robert's Rules when you're having me
 
04:00:30.410 --> 04:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to have
 
04:00:33.530 --> 04:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
within Roberts rules public comment it's
 
04:00:35.929 --> 04:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
a decision made locally but if you have
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
public comment then your your policy
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you've established as a town would
 
04:00:43.849 --> 04:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
govern you know what we're talking about
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
right here the amount of time you might
 
04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know want to have a person speak to
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
if that's in your policies uh and
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's about the the way I used to
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
run the meetings is they had public
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
comment irregardless
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
of what was on the agenda I'm talking
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
about Municipal Affairs and things such
 
04:01:05.330 --> 04:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
as that might be related to a zoning
 
04:01:07.490 --> 04:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
board issue which they've had previously
 
04:01:09.769 --> 04:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
and it's not on the select board agenda
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
I allowed them to speak
 
04:01:14.809 --> 04:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
um I think it's the best way to deal
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
with the public to afford them the
 
04:01:18.290 --> 04:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that option not to
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
ever shut them down
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
I don't that answered your question or
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
not well no I I wasn't so much concerned
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
about what they were talking about as as
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
where they were coming from to talk
 
04:01:31.010 --> 04:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
because I know one of the problems
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
during the shutdown was people were
 
04:01:35.809 --> 04:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
traveling all over the state I can give
 
04:01:37.729 --> 04:01:37.739 align:start position:0%
you another situation when Walmart was
 
04:01:39.410 --> 04:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
moving into Woodsville
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and I was chairing
 
04:01:43.610 --> 04:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
the select where that time and of course
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
Woods was right on the river in Vermont
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
Wells Rivers right across and we had a
 
04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
number of people from Wells River
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
wanting to come in and testify stand up
 
04:01:55.250 --> 04:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
and speak in front of this packed
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
Auditorium about how it's going to cause
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
congestion on their roads they want
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
traffic lights put in by us I would not
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
allow the people from Vermont to speak I
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
told them submit your testimony in
 
04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
writing uh so we took testimony only
 
04:02:10.729 --> 04:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
from the residents of Woodsville
 
04:02:10.739 --> 04:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
from the residents of Woodsville
Haverhill

04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
Haverhill
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
and those towns which surrounding in New
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we did not allow people out of
 
04:02:18.769 --> 04:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
state to speak but there's nothing in
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
this bill that says the school board
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
would have the right to do that if
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
somebody introduces them to Local policy
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
they could do that if they want to do
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
that that's a local decision if it's a
 
04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
local decision do we need this bill
 
04:02:31.380 --> 04:02:32.990 align:start position:0%
local decision do we need this bill
laughs

04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
could in each district do their own
 
04:02:38.330 --> 04:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
policy and and do their own
 
04:02:40.490 --> 04:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
so do we even need this then if each
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
student can do their own policy we're
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
just being called too so
 
04:02:46.610 --> 04:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in a discussion mode
 
04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
here because we're just starting 5 29.
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
um and then 601 following that so
 
04:02:54.479 --> 04:02:56.170 align:start position:0%
um and then 601 following that so
um

04:02:56.170 --> 04:02:56.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is a policy decision
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
um a local decision you know uh you
 
04:03:04.250 --> 04:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
could say that yeah it's up to the local
 
04:03:06.530 --> 04:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
board to decide you know how many
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
minutes we're going to give I do that
 
04:03:10.849 --> 04:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
daily here when the you as a presenter
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
come in I allow you uh 10 15 minutes if
 
04:03:16.729 --> 04:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but subsequent testifiers
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
may only get three minutes
 
04:03:18.960 --> 04:03:21.290 align:start position:0%

yes

04:16:43.969 --> 04:16:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%

04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
Roxanne lecture welcome to speak okay so
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
there was much discussion on the
 
04:32:56.570 --> 04:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
I've written all over it
 
04:32:59.279 --> 04:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
I've written all over it
um

04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
the discussion was
 
04:33:06.051 --> 04:33:06.061 align:start position:0%
first off that we felt that the awards
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
should go to these schools that showed
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
Improvement as opposed to the school
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
district and if it was going to the
 
04:33:16.730 --> 04:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
schools then they didn't need as much
 
04:33:16.740 --> 04:33:18.789 align:start position:0%
schools then they didn't need as much
money

04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
and we could reduce the amount of 500
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
000 instead of a million since we keep
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
throwing around 1 million here and 2
 
04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
million there and whatever and all of
 
04:33:29.631 --> 04:33:29.641 align:start position:0%
those add up
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
so we reduced the total amount
 
04:33:32.279 --> 04:33:34.490 align:start position:0%
so we reduced the total amount
appropriated

04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
04:33:34.500 --> 04:33:36.310 align:start position:0%
appropriated
um

04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
you know okay we reduce the amount to 25
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
000 going to the school well no more not
 
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
in excess of twenty five thousand it
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
continues to be the
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
doe which comes up with what the rules
 
04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
are and who would qualify
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
if there's money left over that money
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
goes to the next year and if there are
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
more than 20 schools which would be more
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
than our total money
 
04:34:18.051 --> 04:34:18.061 align:start position:0%
um then it would be taken in order of
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
most improvement improvement to lease so
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
04:34:25.310 --> 04:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
how good the school is doing yay you're
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
95 percentile you get an award this is
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
you were at 25 percentile and now you're
 
04:34:35.209 --> 04:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
at 32 percentile yay you made
 
04:34:37.730 --> 04:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
improvements so it's Improvement so the
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
schools most likely
 
04:34:45.289 --> 04:34:45.299 align:start position:0%
to get these awards are the ones who are
 
04:34:47.570 --> 04:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
most likely to be the ones who are the
 
04:34:50.570 --> 04:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
most in need at the moment
 
04:34:50.580 --> 04:34:52.929 align:start position:0%
most in need at the moment
um

04:34:52.929 --> 04:34:52.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.131 --> 04:34:55.141 align:start position:0%
what was the other
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to lines four through
 
04:35:00.051 --> 04:35:00.061 align:start position:0%
line six in the original boss
 
04:35:02.689 --> 04:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
intervention for social struck oh yeah
 
04:35:02.699 --> 04:35:04.849 align:start position:0%
intervention for social struck oh yeah
originally

04:35:04.849 --> 04:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
originally
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
the money came from the revenue
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
stabilization Reserve account and that
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
was an issue when this was put in before
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
we are leaving we have not specified
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
where the money comes from we figured
 
04:35:20.449 --> 04:35:20.459 align:start position:0%
that would be up to finance to see where
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
the money was available
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
and take it from wherever it was
 
04:35:24.719 --> 04:35:26.390 align:start position:0%
and take it from wherever it was
available

04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
um rather than us as a policy committing
 
04:35:31.849 --> 04:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
telling Finance where to find the money
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
either ways or means or Finance to
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
decide where that money is to come from
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
let's reward the people who are out
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
there really working to to make a
 
04:35:48.119 --> 04:35:49.250 align:start position:0%
there really working to to make a
difference

04:35:49.250 --> 04:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's that's the
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
point of this
 
04:35:55.609 --> 04:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
let's let's give them something to show
 
04:35:58.369 --> 04:35:58.379 align:start position:0%
for their hard work thank you thank you
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
rep sound forward you'll make her the
 
04:36:01.849 --> 04:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
second do you have anything to say on it
 
04:36:04.730 --> 04:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
oh no further thing represent Allison oh
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
I I had to agree with my colleague to
 
04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
the left that this money probably would
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
go to districts that are most in need
 
04:36:16.970 --> 04:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's no no factual basis for for
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
saying that and I'm on record during our
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
discussions over the last six months or
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
even a year that I'll not be voting for
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
any Appropriations that are not targeted
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
to those school districts that are most
 
04:36:31.010 --> 04:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
in need this has the potential of giving
 
04:36:32.810 --> 04:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars to
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and I don't want to pick on
 
04:36:37.449 --> 04:36:37.459 align:start position:0%
Huffington but I am uh Hanover
 
04:36:41.570 --> 04:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley they don't need the 25
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
000 the 25 000 needs to go to Newport
 
04:36:46.189 --> 04:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
needs to go to Manchester needs to go to
 
04:36:49.010 --> 04:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
Franklin needs to go to Claremont so
 
04:36:50.689 --> 04:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the amendment and
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
I have I have two questions one is in
 
04:37:01.369 --> 04:37:01.379 align:start position:0%
line six a designated standardized
 
04:37:01.379 --> 04:37:02.631 align:start position:0%
line six a designated standardized
mathematics

04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
04:37:02.641 --> 04:37:04.429 align:start position:0%
mathematics
test

04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:37:07.070 --> 04:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
um what exactly
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
is that supposed to mean is that the
 
04:37:09.240 --> 04:37:10.090 align:start position:0%
is that supposed to mean is that the
state

04:37:10.090 --> 04:37:10.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:37:13.369 --> 04:37:13.379 align:start position:0%
standardized test or is it what that
 
04:37:17.689 --> 04:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
would be determined by the doe as to
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
which tests they use probably that is
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
what they would use but there may be
 
04:37:25.369 --> 04:37:25.379 align:start position:0%
well be one that's better or that comes
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
up that's better and so that leaves it
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
and my second question is that now that
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
you've got it by school rather than
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
District of for example in a co-op
 
04:37:41.449 --> 04:37:41.459 align:start position:0%
District like here starts with eight
 
04:37:45.289 --> 04:37:45.299 align:start position:0%
schools if if one of the and they have
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
several elementary schools in a middle
 
04:37:49.209 --> 04:37:49.219 align:start position:0%
school and a high school would it goes
 
04:37:51.650 --> 04:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars to a small
 
04:37:53.449 --> 04:37:53.459 align:start position:0%
elementary school if that elementary
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
school was the one that had the that's
 
04:37:58.131 --> 04:37:58.141 align:start position:0%
why it says
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
um not to exceed twenty five thousand
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
dollars because if it's a very small
 
04:38:05.810 --> 04:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
school it may be that that what the
 
04:38:07.250 --> 04:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
award that they would get would be less
 
04:38:09.769 --> 04:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
than the twenty five thousand dollars
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
if it was very small but it would go to
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
the school itself that showed the
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement not to the whole District so
 
04:38:18.289 --> 04:38:18.299 align:start position:0%
it could be a like a pick and choose how
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
much money they get it isn't like rank
 
04:38:23.570 --> 04:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
ordered for second third fourth and
 
04:38:26.449 --> 04:38:26.459 align:start position:0%
it you know or just the 20 schools each
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
get 25 000 it's it's the idea is the 20
 
04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
schools or 15 if only 15 qualify get 25
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
000 and then that money gets carried
 
04:38:40.970 --> 04:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
over to the next year and again
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the schools get ranked but if more
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
than 20 manage to show whatever the the
 
04:38:47.939 --> 04:38:49.730 align:start position:0%
than 20 manage to show whatever the the
um

04:38:49.730 --> 04:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
whatever the quali whatever the
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
qualifications that are set forth are
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know must improve by x amount but it
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
said it's to take into consideration the
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
size of the school the population all of
 
04:39:02.279 --> 04:39:04.670 align:start position:0%
size of the school the population all of
that

04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.570 --> 04:39:07.580 align:start position:0%
in in making those those
 
04:39:10.910 --> 04:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
criteria for what who deserves an award
 
04:39:15.410 --> 04:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
and then those that qualify but if you
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
end up with 22 qualifying well we
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
haven't put enough money away for 22 so
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to take
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
the time the 20 that show the most
 
04:39:29.090 --> 04:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
Improvement and the reason well I was
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
gonna go ahead
 
04:39:33.289 --> 04:39:33.299 align:start position:0%
so I really
 
04:39:33.299 --> 04:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
so I really
um

04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you've moved it to
 
04:39:38.090 --> 04:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
Improvement rather than you know just
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
total performance so that that that's a
 
04:39:41.930 --> 04:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
big thing but
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of
 
04:39:45.650 --> 04:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit hesitant about the
 
04:39:49.010 --> 04:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences like for uh New
 
04:39:51.410 --> 04:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
London Elementary as part of two or
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
three elementary schools in the district
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden gets twenty five
 
04:39:56.570 --> 04:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
um you know what what that's going to
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
mean and and whether it's going to go
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
just to that elementary school and not
 
04:40:05.930 --> 04:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
the other elementary schools just I I
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
see some unintended consequences with
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
that just I think there's a misread here
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
about how we're interpreting this it
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
says not to exceed 25 Grand
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
so it can be up to it could be an award
 
04:40:23.090 --> 04:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
of five thousand dollars let's say to a
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
smart school or ten thousand and the
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
money that's not used in that first year
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
is used in subsequent years to hand out
 
04:40:33.650 --> 04:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
to the schools which are showing growth
 
04:40:35.448 --> 04:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
in those substant years
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
I unders I understand that concept my my
 
04:40:41.330 --> 04:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
problem is that you you
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
the I guess and you're saying you're
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to the doe for all this
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
criteria but yeah uh so do you have a a
 
04:40:51.890 --> 04:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
list of okay not only the improvements
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
but the Nook is it a mathematical
 
04:40:58.010 --> 04:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
um equation about the size of the school
 
04:41:00.590 --> 04:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
um Improvement the you know the number
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
of pupils
 
04:41:07.610 --> 04:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm I just think it's that's last
 
04:41:09.050 --> 04:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
sentence there in the bill it's
 
04:41:11.170 --> 04:41:11.180 align:start position:0%
describes yeah
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.090 --> 04:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the improvement with the
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
amendment but overall
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
I don't prefer this whole concept I
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
think we should be proactive about
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
helping schools
 
04:41:34.490 --> 04:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
improve their programming as opposed to
 
04:41:34.500 --> 04:41:36.770 align:start position:0%
improve their programming as opposed to
rewarding

04:41:36.770 --> 04:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
rewarding
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
however they got there with money that
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
they can use for anything it could be
 
04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
for a leaky roof not for math but I'm
 
04:41:48.890 --> 04:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
04:41:50.638 --> 04:41:52.190 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
Cornell

04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
04:41:54.890 --> 04:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about the definition of
 
04:41:57.650 --> 04:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
school in this is it a public and public
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
charter school or is this open to
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
religious schools and private schools or
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
any school that shows Improvement on
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
standardized tests or
 
04:42:08.810 --> 04:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
is that in there somewhere
 
04:42:08.820 --> 04:42:09.948 align:start position:0%
is that in there somewhere
of

04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.050 --> 04:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
yeah the idea yes it had said school
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
districts and we changed it to just
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
schools because we wanted the individual
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
schools within the school district
 
04:42:40.850 --> 04:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
and so it says schools but
 
04:42:40.860 --> 04:42:42.590 align:start position:0%
and so it says schools but
um

04:42:42.590 --> 04:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:48.850 --> 04:42:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.010 --> 04:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
but I was wondering who the doe would
 
04:42:54.650 --> 04:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
actually I mean that also could be in
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
the doe rules that says public and
 
04:43:00.288 --> 04:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
public charter
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't say that it's just that
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
school so it could be religious private
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
right well except that it also says
 
04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
shall communicate with school districts
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
and shall adopt such administrative
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
arrangements as necessary to implement
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
this section so that still keeps the
 
04:43:20.030 --> 04:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
idea that it's schools within school
 
04:43:20.040 --> 04:43:22.128 align:start position:0%
idea that it's schools within school
districts

04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent cordelli yes I
 
04:43:27.890 --> 04:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
Department doesn't provide funds to uh
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
your Microsoft's not public schools at
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
this point so I don't see how that would
 
04:43:37.010 --> 04:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
enter into this the only question would
 
04:43:39.410 --> 04:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
be whether it includes Charter Schools
 
04:43:40.850 --> 04:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:43:40.860 --> 04:43:43.070 align:start position:0%
or not
yep

04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
yep

04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
dry
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
um where is this supposed to sit in the
 
04:43:51.060 --> 04:44:04.330 align:start position:0%
um where is this supposed to sit in the
rsas

04:44:04.330 --> 04:44:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually in the beginning it does say
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
relative to making incentive grants for
 
04:44:11.690 --> 04:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
school districts that improve to certain
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
assessment scores so you're already
 
04:44:16.090 --> 04:44:16.100 align:start position:0%
looking at public schools
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
and it does not say where it's actually
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:44:21.780 --> 04:44:29.390 align:start position:0%
going to
sit

04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.010 --> 04:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
that Petter now had her hand up a number
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
of times
 
04:44:40.128 --> 04:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say I think this
 
04:44:40.138 --> 04:44:41.390 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say I think this
this

04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
gives schools the opportunity to
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
innovate and to be creative at the local
 
04:44:51.410 --> 04:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
level in order to decide how they want
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
to improve in order to
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
um achieve these
 
04:44:57.660 --> 04:44:58.730 align:start position:0%
um achieve these
um

04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're not calling them Awards but um
 
04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.320 --> 04:45:09.288 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:45:09.288 --> 04:45:09.298 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
yeah we we like to believe that
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
everybody always works at their 100
 
04:45:16.610 --> 04:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
percent best all the time
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
but what reality tends to show is people
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
work to incentives whatever the
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
incentives are if you give them
 
04:45:25.970 --> 04:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
disincentives they tend to not do if you
 
04:45:27.530 --> 04:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
give them incentives they tend to do
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
more it's the nature of people so we're
 
04:45:32.170 --> 04:45:32.180 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
reward that extra going Beyond to try to
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
figure out what to get what to do and I
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
know you're going to hate that because
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
you think everybody always works a
 
04:45:43.610 --> 04:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
hundred percent I know what schools it's
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
going to be yeah I I would just like to
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
say I don't think schools do things on
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
the basis of getting rewards I think all
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
schools try their hardest for their
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
students to do the best they possibly
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
can without thoughts of monetary rewards
 
04:46:01.970 --> 04:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
in their minds so I I I don't think it
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
incentivizes them or disincent devices
 
04:46:07.090 --> 04:46:07.100 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think the issue
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about is
 
04:46:14.448 --> 04:46:14.458 align:start position:0%
the term
 
04:46:16.970 --> 04:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
really is not Improvement
 
04:46:19.330 --> 04:46:19.340 align:start position:0%
the term really is growth
 
04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
what is the growth of a particular
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
school as it relates to their test
 
04:46:25.730 --> 04:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
scores Etc
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
that's just an aside
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
for the discussion but I'm not through
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh okay the other concern
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
I have here is that this again
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
is another incentivized program
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
that negates the issue of the funding of
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
schools in general
 
04:46:43.740 --> 04:46:45.288 align:start position:0%
schools in general
and

04:46:45.288 --> 04:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
um I have a problem in supporting this
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
without the kind of commitment from
 
04:46:55.010 --> 04:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
right now we're what 24 of State funding
 
04:46:57.530 --> 04:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
04:46:59.890 --> 04:46:59.900 align:start position:0%
um and to me this just again
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh begs the question
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
of what is the state commitment to
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
funding schools in the proper way and
 
04:47:08.810 --> 04:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
this is just another incentivized
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
program that just can to continues to uh
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
to Advocate uh that and not really deal
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
with the the basic issue of funding of
 
04:47:21.050 --> 04:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
schools in general
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%

04:47:25.610 --> 04:47:25.620 align:start position:0%

06:19:14.208 --> 06:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
that deals with relative to the
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
calculation of average daily membership
 
06:19:17.868 --> 06:19:17.878 align:start position:0%

so 625
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and I'll call upon
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%

to speak to the bill uh just briefly um
 
06:20:00.430 --> 06:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
I think that there were some concerns
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
expressed during the hearing especially
 
06:20:03.240 --> 06:20:05.770 align:start position:0%
expressed during the hearing especially
about

06:20:05.770 --> 06:20:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:09.830 --> 06:20:09.840 align:start position:0%

06:20:09.840 --> 06:20:11.350 align:start position:0%
the elementary and middle school levels
possibly

06:20:11.350 --> 06:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
06:20:16.128 --> 06:20:16.138 align:start position:0%
and figuring out uh courses in those
 
06:20:17.890 --> 06:20:17.900 align:start position:0%
grade levels

06:20:23.570 --> 06:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
look for a solution and that was the
 
06:20:26.990 --> 06:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
reason I moved to retain it

06:22:19.010 --> 06:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to evaluate
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
and recommend standards for public
 
06:22:25.690 --> 06:22:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:30.490 --> 06:22:30.500 align:start position:0%
that is I think representative Bill
 
06:22:35.150 --> 06:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.310 --> 06:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.320 --> 06:22:53.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:22:53.530 --> 06:22:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.270 --> 06:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:22:58.250 --> 06:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
let's have a little discussion first in
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
this one before we have a motion on the
 
06:23:03.110 --> 06:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
floor uh let me explain some of where I
 
06:23:06.048 --> 06:23:06.058 align:start position:0%
uh have a couple concerns
 
06:23:07.850 --> 06:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
one of which
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
I think uh the maker of this bill ran
 
06:23:15.650 --> 06:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
out of the alphabet when trying to
 
06:23:18.048 --> 06:23:18.058 align:start position:0%
identify commission members here almost
 
06:23:20.048 --> 06:23:20.058 align:start position:0%
got the Z
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
so that that would be what one one
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
question if you can read between the
 
06:23:27.470 --> 06:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
lines a lot of people on that thing and
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
I understand the the the concern for for
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
the bill uh intent I mean the other
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
concern I do have is is I believe this
 
06:23:41.390 --> 06:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
is a a critical issue that needs some
 
06:23:45.670 --> 06:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
resolution but needs resolution now
 
06:23:48.948 --> 06:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh and I
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm anxious once we start getting the
 
06:23:54.590 --> 06:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
the uh minimum Public School uh
 
06:23:55.910 --> 06:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
standards for minimum Public School
 
06:23:55.920 --> 06:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
standards for minimum Public School
approval

06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
approval
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
that in our in our table here in front
 
06:24:02.330 --> 06:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
of us then we've got to start looking at
 
06:24:05.628 --> 06:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
that and one way we can do that is doing
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
having the
 
06:24:10.310 --> 06:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight for improvement
 
06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and assessment or ourselves doing it as
 
06:24:16.610 --> 06:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee looking at this right now
 
06:24:21.708 --> 06:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
inviting people in to work on this I'm
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure that with those minimum Public
 
06:24:25.490 --> 06:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
School approval standards we're going to
 
06:24:29.690 --> 06:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
be looking at that intently and to then
 
06:24:33.170 --> 06:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
review those this whole committee can do
 
06:24:36.770 --> 06:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
that and we can do it with bringing
 
06:24:38.990 --> 06:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
organizations and agencies to help us do
 
06:24:40.970 --> 06:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
that and we could do it immediately
 
06:24:42.770 --> 06:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
rather than having to wait until this
 
06:24:44.690 --> 06:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
thing's signed into law that's that's my
 
06:24:46.490 --> 06:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
concern right there
 
06:24:49.010 --> 06:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
so I'll let I'll let representative luno
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
who is the primary sponsor of this bill
 
06:24:55.250 --> 06:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh speak to you know the discussion here
 
06:24:58.010 --> 06:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
sure no thanks very much Mr chair and
 
06:25:02.810 --> 06:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:06.890 --> 06:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
the importance the the important piece
 
06:25:11.090 --> 06:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
on in 371 is um is on page two after
 
06:25:14.208 --> 06:25:14.218 align:start position:0%
after we get through the 26 letters of
 
06:25:15.890 --> 06:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
the alphabet
 
06:25:17.810 --> 06:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
um when it talks about what the
 
06:25:22.250 --> 06:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
commission shall do and um and you know
 
06:25:24.530 --> 06:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
and it begins with reviewing the minimum
 
06:25:27.048 --> 06:25:27.058 align:start position:0%
standards then goes on to determining
 
06:25:28.910 --> 06:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
whether the current minimum standards
 
06:25:33.230 --> 06:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
provide and then it goes on to identify
 
06:25:36.830 --> 06:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um Trends and disparities uh in the
 
06:25:39.230 --> 06:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
state across the state and student
 
06:25:41.690 --> 06:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
performance and we certainly have a lot
 
06:25:44.150 --> 06:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
of evidence that that that that exists
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
but but it actually charges the the uh
 
06:25:51.770 --> 06:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
the commission with with specific duties
 
06:25:55.190 --> 06:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
that that sure this committee could the
 
06:25:56.690 --> 06:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
education committee could take that up
 
06:25:58.850 --> 06:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
but we're not charged with taking that
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
up this would actually put into law that
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
this commission has the authority to um
 
06:26:09.890 --> 06:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
to review and um and and uh determine
 
06:26:12.288 --> 06:26:12.298 align:start position:0%
um uh whether the minimum standards
 
06:26:14.930 --> 06:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for an adequate
 
06:26:17.750 --> 06:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
education for all students
 
06:26:17.760 --> 06:26:18.548 align:start position:0%
education for all students
um

06:26:18.548 --> 06:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
I think probably most of us
 
06:26:24.708 --> 06:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
um recognize and I think representative
 
06:26:26.930 --> 06:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
Miler probably want to speak to it a
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
little bit I hope
 
06:26:31.190 --> 06:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
um that that the Department of Education
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
is currently undergo undergoing a
 
06:26:38.090 --> 06:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
a re-drafting actually wholesale changes
 
06:26:40.250 --> 06:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
to the minimum standards for public
 
06:26:45.048 --> 06:26:45.058 align:start position:0%
schools and um and unfortunately it has
 
06:26:48.110 --> 06:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
been done uh without
 
06:26:51.890 --> 06:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
um much collaboration it has been done
 
06:26:55.190 --> 06:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh out of view from members of the
 
06:26:59.150 --> 06:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
public it's been done out of view from
 
06:27:03.170 --> 06:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
from uh superintendents and teachers and
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
school administrators
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
and and this commission would seek to
 
06:27:12.110 --> 06:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
change that by by having them become
 
06:27:15.470 --> 06:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
contributing members to the group that
 
06:27:18.708 --> 06:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
reviews and and determines whether
 
06:27:21.708 --> 06:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
whether changes
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
oh our um you know are are actually you
 
06:27:28.788 --> 06:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
know good for uh providing an adequate
 
06:27:32.570 --> 06:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
education and and uh and addressing
 
06:27:36.170 --> 06:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
disparities uh in student outcomes uh
 
06:27:40.030 --> 06:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
across the state the um the the the the
 
06:27:42.410 --> 06:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
department of Ed who's currently
 
06:27:47.090 --> 06:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
embarking on um on on a a rewrite a
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite of the minimums of the
 
06:27:54.470 --> 06:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public schools is
 
06:27:57.708 --> 06:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
doing so with a contractor
 
06:28:00.530 --> 06:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
um again not very in not a very
 
06:28:03.530 --> 06:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
transparent process but a couple of
 
06:28:06.170 --> 06:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
other rules that they have
 
06:28:10.670 --> 06:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
um Rewritten and proposed recently do
 
06:28:14.030 --> 06:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
things like eliminate requirements for
 
06:28:14.040 --> 06:28:16.128 align:start position:0%
things like eliminate requirements for
superintendents

06:28:16.128 --> 06:28:16.138 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
06:28:18.650 --> 06:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
um and maybe Dr cascadden can speak to
 
06:28:21.230 --> 06:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
this one but but uh I think it would
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
only require a superintendent to have a
 
06:28:25.070 --> 06:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of teaching experience and
 
06:28:27.770 --> 06:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
not much else there's also a proposed
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
rule that I think is before the State
 
06:28:32.270 --> 06:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
Board of Education soon they just had a
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on it last month that would
 
06:28:37.970 --> 06:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh requirements or
 
06:28:39.890 --> 06:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
qualifications for school business
 
06:28:42.830 --> 06:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
officers so the school business officer
 
06:28:46.730 --> 06:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
in Hopkinton might the town I live in
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
um has 24 million dollars go go through
 
06:28:53.090 --> 06:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
her hands uh every year and it would
 
06:28:55.490 --> 06:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate the the requirements for
 
06:28:58.548 --> 06:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
school business officers so to be honest
 
06:29:01.490 --> 06:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the track record
 
06:29:03.890 --> 06:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's track record in terms
 
06:29:06.470 --> 06:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
of eliminating requirements I think
 
06:29:08.930 --> 06:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
should should really cause people across
 
06:29:10.910 --> 06:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
06:29:13.970 --> 06:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
um uh some you know pretty strong degree
 
06:29:17.830 --> 06:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
of concern and um and you know
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent so that's District
 
06:29:22.128 --> 06:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
Leadership School business officers
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's um that's that's Financial
 
06:29:26.690 --> 06:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
integrity and fiduciary responsibilities
 
06:29:26.700 --> 06:29:28.368 align:start position:0%
integrity and fiduciary responsibilities
and

06:29:28.368 --> 06:29:28.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:31.310 --> 06:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and what this bill talks about is
 
06:29:33.350 --> 06:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
obviously the minimum standards for uh
 
06:29:35.690 --> 06:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
for schools so that's our that's our
 
06:29:40.270 --> 06:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:45.410 --> 06:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I I wholeheartedly support what
 
06:29:48.470 --> 06:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
the chair suggests that that that this
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
committee get involved in it but at the
 
06:29:52.970 --> 06:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
same time
 
06:29:56.090 --> 06:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
having having a statute that says that
 
06:29:58.610 --> 06:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
it is the responsibility of this
 
06:30:01.430 --> 06:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
commission to do it and there's no rush
 
06:30:04.430 --> 06:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
to do it we don't need to run you know
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
full speed into a brick wall when it
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
comes to the uh the minimum standards we
 
06:30:13.788 --> 06:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
have time to for this bill to go through
 
06:30:16.490 --> 06:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
the legislative process to be signed
 
06:30:19.490 --> 06:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
into law by the governor in June for the
 
06:30:21.410 --> 06:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
commission to be named over the summer
 
06:30:23.690 --> 06:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
and for it to start meeting in the fall
 
06:30:27.288 --> 06:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
and um uh and I think the timing of that
 
06:30:30.610 --> 06:30:30.620 align:start position:0%
would be um would be really good
 
06:30:34.250 --> 06:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
considering that may be similar to the
 
06:30:37.850 --> 06:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
timing when when when the the uh the
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department's contractor begins to um uh
 
06:30:44.570 --> 06:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
disseminate the um the draft changes of
 
06:30:47.628 --> 06:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
the rules this committee was promised
 
06:30:50.750 --> 06:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:52.730 --> 06:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
that we were going to receive
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the Draft rules by Friday oh you'll have
 
06:31:00.170 --> 06:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
them on Friday I'm I I think we all
 
06:31:02.090 --> 06:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
thought that he was talking about fat
 
06:31:04.548 --> 06:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
Friday of that week I had no reason to
 
06:31:06.530 --> 06:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
believe that he wasn't speaking of that
 
06:31:10.128 --> 06:31:10.138 align:start position:0%
but today we still haven't received them
 
06:31:10.138 --> 06:31:10.788 align:start position:0%
but today we still haven't received them
um

06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:14.448 --> 06:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
so I for all of those reasons
 
06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
um I I think um this commission is real
 
06:31:17.878 --> 06:31:19.670 align:start position:0%
um I I think um this commission is real
important

06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:31:25.730 --> 06:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative cascadden
 
06:31:30.350 --> 06:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think it's a good
 
06:31:33.048 --> 06:31:33.058 align:start position:0%
idea to work through this as you
 
06:31:36.170 --> 06:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned and representative luno did
 
06:31:39.770 --> 06:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
because it was created without a teacher
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
as the representative
 
06:31:44.090 --> 06:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
and who best is in the field is a
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher
 
06:31:48.770 --> 06:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
it also has some very radical changes in
 
06:31:51.530 --> 06:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
it and I'm not opposed to changes and if
 
06:31:53.150 --> 06:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
these are the changes
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's going to affect a lot
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
more than just saying here's the minimum
 
06:32:02.350 --> 06:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
standards because for school approval
 
06:32:05.990 --> 06:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
you need to implement the minimum
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
standards and this and the
 
06:32:10.010 --> 06:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations that I have and the
 
06:32:11.570 --> 06:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been brought up by
 
06:32:13.610 --> 06:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
school administrators because that's
 
06:32:15.530 --> 06:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
where I got my information is that the
 
06:32:17.690 --> 06:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
transition is going from eliminating
 
06:32:20.090 --> 06:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
grades to learning levels and the
 
06:32:22.030 --> 06:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
question is well what's a learning level
 
06:32:25.070 --> 06:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
eliminating courses and going to a
 
06:32:26.930 --> 06:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity what's a learning
 
06:32:29.330 --> 06:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity it removes all of the
 
06:32:31.970 --> 06:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness work that
 
06:32:34.368 --> 06:32:34.378 align:start position:0%
have been implemented in the last say 10
 
06:32:34.378 --> 06:32:35.770 align:start position:0%
have been implemented in the last say 10
years

06:32:35.770 --> 06:32:35.780 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:32:39.890 --> 06:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
so it is radical it also adds education
 
06:32:42.048 --> 06:32:42.058 align:start position:0%
that is meeting the emotional health
 
06:32:44.330 --> 06:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
needs of students
 
06:32:46.548 --> 06:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
how do you how are you going to know if
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're meeting their needs on an
 
06:32:51.048 --> 06:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
emotional level if it's in the minimum
 
06:32:53.570 --> 06:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
standards and you don't have a the
 
06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
Personnel to
 
06:32:56.750 --> 06:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
deal with that
 
06:32:56.760 --> 06:32:58.368 align:start position:0%
deal with that
or

06:32:58.368 --> 06:32:58.378 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:33:00.890 --> 06:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
you have to question somehow to find out
 
06:33:03.590 --> 06:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
who does need those needs
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
um so there's some radical things here
 
06:33:07.368 --> 06:33:07.378 align:start position:0%
you know there are some good things in
 
06:33:08.930 --> 06:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
it because yes
 
06:33:11.030 --> 06:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
things have to change we're in a
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
different world and we want more
 
06:33:15.708 --> 06:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities for kids not less
 
06:33:18.650 --> 06:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
but remember the school funding is based
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
on minimum adequate education not an
 
06:33:21.600 --> 06:33:22.430 align:start position:0%
on minimum adequate education not an
average

06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
average
 
06:33:24.708 --> 06:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
not a maximum
 
06:33:26.330 --> 06:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
so that's where you have the disparity
 
06:33:29.090 --> 06:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
but it needs some work and it needs
 
06:33:30.830 --> 06:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
people at the table
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
to make that transition and there needs
 
06:33:33.948 --> 06:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
flow chart of transition in a time
 
06:33:36.120 --> 06:33:37.730 align:start position:0%
flow chart of transition in a time
period

06:33:37.730 --> 06:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:33:39.410 --> 06:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lauer did you
 
06:33:41.208 --> 06:33:41.218 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yes
 
06:33:44.048 --> 06:33:44.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:33:46.610 --> 06:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
06:33:50.090 --> 06:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
these minimum standards are reviewed
 
06:33:52.910 --> 06:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
and as both representative cascaden and
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
Malinois said these standards are
 
06:33:55.320 --> 06:33:56.270 align:start position:0%
Malinois said these standards are
critical

06:33:56.270 --> 06:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
critical
 
06:33:58.430 --> 06:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
because they basically provide a
 
06:33:58.440 --> 06:33:59.868 align:start position:0%
because they basically provide a
foundation

06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
for what's going to be taught in schools
 
06:34:06.650 --> 06:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
this uh current review was started two
 
06:34:08.390 --> 06:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:34:11.150 --> 06:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
it was contracted to a private outside
 
06:34:11.160 --> 06:34:12.350 align:start position:0%
it was contracted to a private outside
group

06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:34:15.170 --> 06:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
I have talked with the the director of
 
06:34:16.788 --> 06:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
that program
 
06:34:19.250 --> 06:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
they have been working on it for the
 
06:34:22.610 --> 06:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
past 24 months and are now beginning to
 
06:34:25.850 --> 06:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
share what they have come up with uh
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden has mentioned
 
06:34:30.590 --> 06:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
some of the inputs there The Dilemma
 
06:34:32.750 --> 06:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I think has taken place here that
 
06:34:34.810 --> 06:34:34.820 align:start position:0%
there has been developed
 
06:34:38.570 --> 06:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
within a certain cloud of secrecy and
 
06:34:40.610 --> 06:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
that's what's caused a lot of angst
 
06:34:43.548 --> 06:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
within the school Community about what
 
06:34:46.368 --> 06:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
really is going on and it is just now
 
06:34:49.250 --> 06:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
that it's beginning to emerge to try to
 
06:34:51.310 --> 06:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
include people
 
06:34:53.930 --> 06:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
to get input from them I know that
 
06:34:56.750 --> 06:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
they've had a chance to meet with the
 
06:35:00.970 --> 06:35:00.980 align:start position:0%
ascd which is the association of
 
06:35:03.530 --> 06:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's a curriculum directors it's it's
 
06:35:05.208 --> 06:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
the folks who basically deal with
 
06:35:07.548 --> 06:35:07.558 align:start position:0%
curriculum out in the field they've met
 
06:35:09.350 --> 06:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
with them and for a couple days have
 
06:35:12.410 --> 06:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
gotten input from them the the dilemma
 
06:35:14.170 --> 06:35:14.180 align:start position:0%
though is that there has been
 
06:35:18.110 --> 06:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there is suspicion
 
06:35:22.128 --> 06:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
um with uh I hate to say this but to be
 
06:35:24.048 --> 06:35:24.058 align:start position:0%
very blunt with the commissioner
 
06:35:26.270 --> 06:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners appeared before this
 
06:35:29.208 --> 06:35:29.218 align:start position:0%
committee once in the last two or three
 
06:35:29.218 --> 06:35:30.170 align:start position:0%
committee once in the last two or three
years

06:35:30.170 --> 06:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:35:33.470 --> 06:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
because he had a proposal for changing
 
06:35:34.910 --> 06:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum those of us that were on the
 
06:35:36.470 --> 06:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee last year will remember that
 
06:35:40.128 --> 06:35:40.138 align:start position:0%
that time he came in and gave us his
 
06:35:42.048 --> 06:35:42.058 align:start position:0%
view of what the standard should be
 
06:35:44.810 --> 06:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
which caused severe concerns for some of
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
us on his theory about whether it should
 
06:35:51.350 --> 06:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
be that I think has somewhat clouded the
 
06:35:53.690 --> 06:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
perspective of looking at the current
 
06:35:56.750 --> 06:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
current standards what this proposal is
 
06:35:58.490 --> 06:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to create some
 
06:36:00.310 --> 06:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight
 
06:36:05.270 --> 06:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
regarding standards Etc and I think one
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that I know chairman Ladd
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
and I have talked about this is that how
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
do you how do you provide an opportunity
 
06:36:15.470 --> 06:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
for transparency when you're beginning
 
06:36:19.010 --> 06:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
to look at new new new programs so
 
06:36:21.048 --> 06:36:21.058 align:start position:0%
there's no question in my mind that the
 
06:36:22.970 --> 06:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
standards have to be revised they were
 
06:36:24.708 --> 06:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
done 10 years ago we need a revised
 
06:36:26.448 --> 06:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
there's no question about that but the
 
06:36:29.030 --> 06:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
question is is how is it done how do you
 
06:36:31.730 --> 06:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
how do you engage the school Community
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically out there on a
 
06:36:35.390 --> 06:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis seeing these changes
 
06:36:37.850 --> 06:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
and what students are bringing to the
 
06:36:39.530 --> 06:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
classroom there's no question in my mind
 
06:36:41.330 --> 06:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
that students are bringing to school
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
today a much higher level of how they
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
get information I remember talking to
 
06:36:49.070 --> 06:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
one student
 
06:36:51.288 --> 06:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
and uh he was he pulled out his phone
 
06:36:53.750 --> 06:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
and he says well this is where I get my
 
06:36:55.970 --> 06:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
information Mr Milan and he said I said
 
06:36:57.708 --> 06:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
what do you mean he says well ask me a
 
06:36:59.930 --> 06:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
question now this this happened to me 10
 
06:37:02.690 --> 06:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
years ago right so I I forget what the
 
06:37:04.610 --> 06:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
question was and he goes like this and
 
06:37:07.548 --> 06:37:07.558 align:start position:0%
he says is this the answer I said yeah
 
06:37:09.948 --> 06:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
that is the answer he said now this is
 
06:37:12.110 --> 06:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
the problem I have I know where to get
 
06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
the information what I need schools to
 
06:37:16.730 --> 06:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
tell me about how do I deal with this
 
06:37:19.128 --> 06:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
information that's what I go to school
 
06:37:19.138 --> 06:37:19.970 align:start position:0%
information that's what I go to school
for

06:37:19.970 --> 06:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:37:22.990 --> 06:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
so as we begin to look at those kinds of
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
transitions of of opportunities for what
 
06:37:29.208 --> 06:37:29.218 align:start position:0%
students bring to the school right now
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and what teachers have to deal with from
 
06:37:33.708 --> 06:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
a technology standpoint of availability
 
06:37:36.170 --> 06:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
of information how do we deal with those
 
06:37:38.090 --> 06:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
standards and I think what we're trying
 
06:37:40.310 --> 06:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
to do here in this particular proposal
 
06:37:43.970 --> 06:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
is to provide some some oversight and
 
06:37:46.670 --> 06:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
some transparency of how we begin to
 
06:37:48.170 --> 06:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
look at these things in a much more
 
06:37:50.628 --> 06:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
Global passion rather than having five
 
06:37:53.330 --> 06:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
or six people sitting over here in a
 
06:37:56.510 --> 06:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
Kabbalah excuse me it's my editorial but
 
06:37:59.208 --> 06:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
as as a trying to develop this without
 
06:38:01.430 --> 06:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
engaging other people in the community
 
06:38:03.410 --> 06:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
until after
 
06:38:06.230 --> 06:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
the thing is uh kind of been set in
 
06:38:09.288 --> 06:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
stone so my hope is that that this kind
 
06:38:11.270 --> 06:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
of a commission would provide a much
 
06:38:13.548 --> 06:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
greater transparent on an ongoing basis
 
06:38:16.128 --> 06:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
not just necessarily on a 10-year basis
 
06:38:18.170 --> 06:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:38:20.448 --> 06:38:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to just make a couple
 
06:38:22.430 --> 06:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
comments here that
 
06:38:24.350 --> 06:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
first of all the legislation that came
 
06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
before the house in the previous year
 
06:38:28.970 --> 06:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
that representative just spoke to was
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward by Representatives
 
06:38:33.470 --> 06:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
I was one of them
 
06:38:35.868 --> 06:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't the commissioner bringing
 
06:38:38.810 --> 06:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
it forward to this table as myself and
 
06:38:40.368 --> 06:38:40.378 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there were certain
 
06:38:42.048 --> 06:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
things we wanted to do with the adequacy
 
06:38:44.208 --> 06:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
of which the end result was that's how
 
06:38:48.250 --> 06:38:48.260 align:start position:0%
we got uh financial literacy
 
06:38:51.410 --> 06:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
built into the adequacy formula the
 
06:38:53.448 --> 06:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
second part I want to mention too is
 
06:38:55.448 --> 06:38:55.458 align:start position:0%
that you recall last year we did
 
06:38:57.708 --> 06:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
reinstate the legislative oversight
 
06:38:57.718 --> 06:38:59.330 align:start position:0%
reinstate the legislative oversight
committee

06:38:59.330 --> 06:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:39:01.310 --> 06:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the legislative oversight committee
 
06:39:04.128 --> 06:39:04.138 align:start position:0%
does have specific statutory authority
 
06:39:06.650 --> 06:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
to be doing this it says right here
 
06:39:08.510 --> 06:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
review and make recommendations related
 
06:39:10.250 --> 06:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
to academic standards under
 
06:39:11.810 --> 06:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
consideration by the State Board of
 
06:39:16.090 --> 06:39:16.100 align:start position:0%
Education pursuant to RSA 19382
 
06:39:20.030 --> 06:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature has given to the State
 
06:39:22.610 --> 06:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the responsibility
 
06:39:24.890 --> 06:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
they have been given that responsibility
 
06:39:28.730 --> 06:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
for developing the academic standards
 
06:39:30.650 --> 06:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
and the minimum School approval
 
06:39:33.650 --> 06:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
standards that's been given directly to
 
06:39:36.288 --> 06:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
the State Board not to the legislature
 
06:39:37.788 --> 06:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
06:39:39.708 --> 06:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
but we have the oversight
 
06:39:39.718 --> 06:39:41.868 align:start position:0%
but we have the oversight
responsibilities

06:39:41.868 --> 06:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
06:39:44.448 --> 06:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
and this is why I'm trying to say that
 
06:39:48.470 --> 06:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to do our job the
 
06:39:50.570 --> 06:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee which is
 
06:39:53.270 --> 06:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of this members in this body right
 
06:39:57.048 --> 06:39:57.058 align:start position:0%
here are on it and the house we in the
 
06:39:59.330 --> 06:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
Senate we have that responsibility and
 
06:40:02.288 --> 06:40:02.298 align:start position:0%
we have the statutory authority to do it
 
06:40:06.650 --> 06:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I don't see the need to accomplish
 
06:40:09.650 --> 06:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
what is trying to be accomplished in the
 
06:40:11.690 --> 06:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill that's before us is the only way of
 
06:40:15.470 --> 06:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
doing that in fact we have a process
 
06:40:17.390 --> 06:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
um now what we want to do is shift gears
 
06:40:20.390 --> 06:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
and go to another process which I think
 
06:40:24.048 --> 06:40:24.058 align:start position:0%
that's just totally a counter to what we
 
06:40:26.510 --> 06:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
did by bringing and reinstating this
 
06:40:29.570 --> 06:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that uh
 
06:40:31.750 --> 06:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
had been
 
06:40:34.788 --> 06:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
deleted from statute back several years
 
06:40:36.650 --> 06:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
ago when we were looking at all the
 
06:40:38.208 --> 06:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
different committees that hadn't worked
 
06:40:40.070 --> 06:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
for a while and yes that one hadn't
 
06:40:41.750 --> 06:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
worked since we had identified the
 
06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
education of Essa and and uh and when we
 
06:40:49.490 --> 06:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
changed our our Statewide assessment it
 
06:40:51.410 --> 06:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
was active then but we haven't made some
 
06:40:53.208 --> 06:40:53.218 align:start position:0%
changes since then so it was two years
 
06:40:54.650 --> 06:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
then people say oh there's no more need
 
06:40:56.448 --> 06:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
for this well yeah there is a need
 
06:40:58.490 --> 06:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
because every 10 years as represented my
 
06:41:00.590 --> 06:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
own mentioned we have the task with the
 
06:41:03.708 --> 06:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
response but for looking at adequacy and
 
06:41:05.030 --> 06:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing through that
 
06:41:07.548 --> 06:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
bill when we looked at adequacy we
 
06:41:10.190 --> 06:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
looked at it and modified it and we got
 
06:41:12.650 --> 06:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
things such as logic and rhetoric built
 
06:41:15.470 --> 06:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
in we've got the the we looked at the
 
06:41:19.128 --> 06:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
indicators of that whole process so but
 
06:41:21.530 --> 06:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
now the next step is let's look at this
 
06:41:23.628 --> 06:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
minimum Public School approval standards
 
06:41:26.750 --> 06:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
and when they are issued by the state
 
06:41:28.548 --> 06:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
board when they issue are the Department
 
06:41:31.010 --> 06:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
issues that that's when we have the
 
06:41:32.810 --> 06:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have the
 
06:41:36.650 --> 06:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take them and look at
 
06:41:38.390 --> 06:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
them and do as we've been told we have
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
to do in legislation review and make
 
06:41:43.910 --> 06:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations on that so for them to
 
06:41:45.470 --> 06:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
go forward they have to have our
 
06:41:45.480 --> 06:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
go forward they have to have our
recommendations

06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
06:41:49.368 --> 06:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a process I think
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's the process we should follow
 
06:41:53.390 --> 06:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
06:41:55.788 --> 06:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee we
 
06:41:59.390 --> 06:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
met on Tuesday January 10th and we were
 
06:42:01.368 --> 06:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
told on that date that was a Tuesday
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
that on Friday we would have an updated
 
06:42:06.530 --> 06:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
copy of the 306
 
06:42:06.540 --> 06:42:08.570 align:start position:0%
copy of the 306
recommendations

06:42:08.570 --> 06:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
06:42:10.730 --> 06:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen them no they haven't been
 
06:42:12.770 --> 06:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
provided to us yet that's right but that
 
06:42:14.750 --> 06:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the legislative oversight
 
06:42:17.930 --> 06:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
committee is you know they're ignoring
 
06:42:20.270 --> 06:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
us we've had between now and then a lot
 
06:42:21.948 --> 06:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
of bills which we have been addressing
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's just like we have to get the
 
06:42:25.368 --> 06:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure commission
 
06:42:27.470 --> 06:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
going too that will start up after March
 
06:42:30.530 --> 06:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
16th the the legislative oversight
 
06:42:32.990 --> 06:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement assessment committee that of
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
oversight that I just mentioned either
 
06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
written down to get that scheduled for
 
06:42:39.770 --> 06:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
right after March 16th here well we have
 
06:42:43.070 --> 06:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
a copy of the 306 recommendation that's
 
06:42:44.150 --> 06:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to come from the state
 
06:42:45.830 --> 06:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
board I can't guarantee anything because
 
06:42:47.810 --> 06:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
we've asked but those are going to
 
06:42:49.610 --> 06:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
eventually have to come out and when
 
06:42:51.410 --> 06:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
they do come out that's what our that's
 
06:42:53.810 --> 06:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
when our job will begin because they did
 
06:42:55.368 --> 06:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
tell us on January 10th that we would
 
06:42:57.530 --> 06:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
have them by that Friday
 
06:43:00.770 --> 06:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
I can recall that yeah that so I'm not
 
06:43:03.650 --> 06:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
negating that I'm just saying that uh
 
06:43:05.990 --> 06:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's all the more reason why we want
 
06:43:08.810 --> 06:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
to be looking at that but we have all
 
06:43:10.368 --> 06:43:10.378 align:start position:0%
these responsibilities the oversight
 
06:43:12.890 --> 06:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee has we've listed them from
 
06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
from a to l
 
06:43:18.470 --> 06:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we have responsibilities to do we
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
need to follow those responsibilities
 
06:43:22.970 --> 06:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
and the process has been set up I don't
 
06:43:25.850 --> 06:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
see the need for going for 371.
 
06:43:28.368 --> 06:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you I have a
 
06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
question about the legislate legislative
 
06:43:33.110 --> 06:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
um is that an oversight Committee in
 
06:43:38.030 --> 06:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
general for everything or is it
 
06:43:40.490 --> 06:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
specifically for the minimum standards
 
06:43:42.590 --> 06:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
because my thought is
 
06:43:42.600 --> 06:43:44.930 align:start position:0%
because my thought is
that

06:43:44.930 --> 06:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
this commission is specifically for the
 
06:43:50.270 --> 06:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and it what I like
 
06:43:52.010 --> 06:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:43:54.530 --> 06:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
very much is that it that it does have
 
06:43:57.250 --> 06:43:57.260 align:start position:0%
almost all the letters except Z
 
06:44:00.350 --> 06:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
on being inclusive
 
06:44:02.810 --> 06:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and you know back in the dinosaur age
 
06:44:04.910 --> 06:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
when I first came to New Hampshire to
 
06:44:04.920 --> 06:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
when I first came to New Hampshire to
teach

06:44:05.750 --> 06:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
teach
 
06:44:08.330 --> 06:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
I started teaching in an open concept
 
06:44:10.690 --> 06:44:10.700 align:start position:0%
school which was
 
06:44:14.690 --> 06:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh very state of the art at the time
 
06:44:16.610 --> 06:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
um there were only seven schools in New
 
06:44:18.410 --> 06:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that were open concept at the
 
06:44:20.510 --> 06:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
time Charlie Marsden was the
 
06:44:22.330 --> 06:44:22.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education at the time
 
06:44:25.628 --> 06:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
and I remember spending the whole year
 
06:44:28.448 --> 06:44:28.458 align:start position:0%
before we actually went into the school
 
06:44:31.868 --> 06:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
to develop curriculum to develop
 
06:44:35.448 --> 06:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
procedures the state department came uh
 
06:44:37.310 --> 06:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
on a once a week to meet with the
 
06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
faculty that was going to go to that
 
06:44:40.690 --> 06:44:40.700 align:start position:0%
particular high school
 
06:44:43.310 --> 06:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
so that when the first day came
 
06:44:46.190 --> 06:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
everybody was pretty much ready and
 
06:44:48.230 --> 06:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty much going and we talked
 
06:44:50.570 --> 06:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
about the community response to that I
 
06:44:54.190 --> 06:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
mean it was such a a large inclusive
 
06:44:56.810 --> 06:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
deal this one sounds like all of a
 
06:44:59.030 --> 06:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
sudden they're going to unveil the
 
06:45:02.208 --> 06:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards dump them on the
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
table and I don't know if your
 
06:45:06.948 --> 06:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
legislative committee has other things
 
06:45:09.948 --> 06:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
to look at and be oversight uh besides
 
06:45:12.650 --> 06:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
this but it doesn't have
 
06:45:16.250 --> 06:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
the you know the different members the
 
06:45:19.548 --> 06:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative of terrible uh unit
 
06:45:22.010 --> 06:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a school nurse it doesn't
 
06:45:25.490 --> 06:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
have teachers and the State Board of
 
06:45:27.410 --> 06:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
Education is set up so that there's no
 
06:45:31.330 --> 06:45:31.340 align:start position:0%
one within with current educational
 
06:45:36.590 --> 06:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities so it's like um
 
06:45:38.510 --> 06:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
I just feel as though the commission
 
06:45:41.810 --> 06:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
would be great and it would soften the
 
06:45:41.820 --> 06:45:42.708 align:start position:0%
would be great and it would soften the
the

06:45:42.708 --> 06:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:45:42.718 --> 06:45:43.610 align:start position:0%
the
um

06:45:43.610 --> 06:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:45.410 --> 06:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
the load of this whole thing on
 
06:45:47.448 --> 06:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
particularly on teachers and on schools
 
06:45:51.650 --> 06:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:53.690 --> 06:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
06:45:58.368 --> 06:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
very simple what is the RSA for the
 
06:45:59.868 --> 06:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee that
 
06:46:03.910 --> 06:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
you're representing 193-c colon 8
 
06:46:07.490 --> 06:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
Dash a legislative oversight committee
 
06:46:09.048 --> 06:46:09.058 align:start position:0%
Statewide education Improvement and
 
06:46:12.410 --> 06:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
Assessment program thank you we when we
 
06:46:15.350 --> 06:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
identified with the new math standards
 
06:46:17.690 --> 06:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
those math standards were approved by
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
the Legislative oversight committee
 
06:46:23.690 --> 06:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
they could not use those Mass standards
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
until that committee had approved them
 
06:46:28.910 --> 06:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
so the the committee has been used
 
06:46:31.010 --> 06:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
before in this regard
 
06:46:33.468 --> 06:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
now I don't know why we want to diverge
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
and move off course yes we that
 
06:46:38.628 --> 06:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee can pull in as many people as
 
06:46:41.090 --> 06:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
many organizations that are required to
 
06:46:41.100 --> 06:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
many organizations that are required to
review

06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:46:44.690 --> 06:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
can hold hearings can do the whole nine
 
06:46:48.890 --> 06:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
yards and it can start right off as soon
 
06:46:50.930 --> 06:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
as those standards are approved if
 
06:46:52.490 --> 06:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to wait for this bill to
 
06:46:54.708 --> 06:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
get it's going to be
 
06:46:57.530 --> 06:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
um what the effective date is
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
um this section is shall take effect
 
06:47:02.770 --> 06:47:02.780 align:start position:0%
November 1 no
 
06:47:06.530 --> 06:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
2027. yeah I think it's um some problem
 
06:47:08.510 --> 06:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
with the effective date so we're talking
 
06:47:13.548 --> 06:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:17.030 --> 06:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:17.040 --> 06:47:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:47:17.930 --> 06:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:20.690 --> 06:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
06:47:23.868 --> 06:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
so I it's you know
 
06:47:26.930 --> 06:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
personally if you want to have ability
 
06:47:29.690 --> 06:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
to do something and recommend on them
 
06:47:32.330 --> 06:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
the quickest way and the statutory way
 
06:47:34.430 --> 06:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
to do it is with the oversight committee
 
06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
which we and represent literal you and I
 
06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:46.850 --> 06:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
06:47:48.890 --> 06:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
so two things and please correct me if
 
06:47:50.208 --> 06:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong
 
06:47:50.218 --> 06:47:51.410 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong
um

06:47:51.410 --> 06:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
the date on HB 371 of 2027 is only for
 
06:47:59.690 --> 06:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
the repeal
 
06:48:03.410 --> 06:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
of number two the actual first report is
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2025. it's much sooner
 
06:48:10.610 --> 06:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
preliminary for June 1st 2024. uh
 
06:48:13.730 --> 06:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
separately from that just in
 
06:48:15.650 --> 06:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
a quick looking at the legislative
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
oversight committee the membership of
 
06:48:19.368 --> 06:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
that is completely different from the
 
06:48:21.650 --> 06:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
membership proposed here and in my mind
 
06:48:24.770 --> 06:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
it is much less comprehensive
 
06:48:26.770 --> 06:48:26.780 align:start position:0%
but strictly
 
06:48:29.270 --> 06:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislators there there's no
 
06:48:31.490 --> 06:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
specification of there being people of
 
06:48:31.500 --> 06:48:32.628 align:start position:0%
specification of there being people of
any

06:48:32.628 --> 06:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:48:36.048 --> 06:48:36.058 align:start position:0%
educational discipline at all
 
06:48:38.270 --> 06:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to all of us legislators
 
06:48:38.280 --> 06:48:40.010 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to all of us legislators
but

06:48:40.010 --> 06:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:48:43.730 --> 06:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
well in response to that we've had these
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
committees before and we pull in all
 
06:48:48.830 --> 06:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of people to testify and assist
 
06:48:51.890 --> 06:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
and participate uh they don't all have
 
06:48:55.490 --> 06:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
to be listed we have brought them in I
 
06:48:57.350 --> 06:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
can remember numerous committees which
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've had on curricular areas we brought
 
06:49:03.048 --> 06:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
in the Specialists be it the the
 
06:49:04.850 --> 06:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
people sitting right there person
 
06:49:06.410 --> 06:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
sitting there right now from the school
 
06:49:08.510 --> 06:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
board say then active participants in
 
06:49:10.910 --> 06:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
the past we've had various organizations
 
06:49:13.788 --> 06:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
come in that are in support of reading
 
06:49:16.010 --> 06:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
or mathematics come in and speak to
 
06:49:18.830 --> 06:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
where we are where we need to go uh so
 
06:49:21.770 --> 06:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
this doesn't eliminate you from using
 
06:49:25.070 --> 06:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:27.530 --> 06:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's the vehicle that the
 
06:49:29.090 --> 06:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
state has set up to do what you're
 
06:49:31.190 --> 06:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
asking do by way of this way right here
 
06:49:33.170 --> 06:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
unless you're willing to put together
 
06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
all this all the staff here and have all
 
06:49:37.730 --> 06:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
these people voting or something pulling
 
06:49:40.610 --> 06:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
them in it's going to be a huge huge
 
06:49:43.010 --> 06:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
task when it can be done efficiently
 
06:49:46.548 --> 06:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
with what we have in the books right now
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:52.910 --> 06:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
Representative cordelli no thank you uh
 
06:49:54.530 --> 06:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes even with
 
06:49:56.270 --> 06:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
um study committees over the summer
 
06:49:58.670 --> 06:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
we've pulled in many different groups
 
06:50:01.128 --> 06:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
many different people so
 
06:50:05.990 --> 06:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that that is common in uh is um part
 
06:50:07.910 --> 06:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
06:50:11.570 --> 06:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and I I see the duplication between
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
this and the oversight Committee just in
 
06:50:18.708 --> 06:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
lines 27 and 28 with the recommendations
 
06:50:21.708 --> 06:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
um parallel what's in uh statute now for
 
06:50:24.288 --> 06:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
the oversight uh committee
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so I I think I agree with the
 
06:50:28.490 --> 06:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
chairman in that
 
06:50:30.830 --> 06:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
um you know if we really want to take a
 
06:50:33.410 --> 06:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
look at the minimum standards
 
06:50:33.420 --> 06:50:34.208 align:start position:0%
look at the minimum standards
um

06:50:34.208 --> 06:50:34.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:37.610 --> 06:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
we have in place already the vehicle to
 
06:50:39.610 --> 06:50:39.620 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:50:42.890 --> 06:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden just repeat that
 
06:50:48.410 --> 06:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
apital C
 
06:50:52.490 --> 06:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
colon 8.
 
06:50:56.270 --> 06:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:04.190 --> 06:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:07.850 --> 06:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:09.530 --> 06:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
the page number oh she's skipping the
 
06:51:12.830 --> 06:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:14.750 --> 06:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
represent Allison your hand up yes
 
06:51:17.750 --> 06:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
please uh I I think it's related to the
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
bill not necessarily the substance but
 
06:51:22.730 --> 06:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm wondering and this is
 
06:51:24.948 --> 06:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
anyone's guess but I'd like to hear some
 
06:51:26.448 --> 06:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
guesses I wonder where you're going to
 
06:51:28.010 --> 06:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
see the draft of the standards are we
 
06:51:29.330 --> 06:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
talking about another month we're
 
06:51:30.770 --> 06:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
talking about three months we're talking
 
06:51:33.770 --> 06:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
about September or we were hey and are
 
06:51:36.170 --> 06:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
there any assurances from anybody that
 
06:51:37.730 --> 06:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's a date out in the future where
 
06:51:39.410 --> 06:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
they will be available
 
06:51:47.930 --> 06:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:47.940 --> 06:51:54.468 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:54.478 --> 06:52:00.288 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:52:00.288 --> 06:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:03.288 --> 06:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:08.270 --> 06:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:12.350 --> 06:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:18.708 --> 06:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:18.718 --> 06:52:34.610 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:52:34.610 --> 06:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.670 --> 06:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair yeah and it does
 
06:52:40.208 --> 06:52:40.218 align:start position:0%
say specifically that we don't have the
 
06:52:43.490 --> 06:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility in law to develop these
 
06:52:45.288 --> 06:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
it's that of the State Board of
 
06:52:48.110 --> 06:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
Education both minimum standards and the
 
06:52:50.570 --> 06:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
minimum Public School approval standards
 
06:52:53.390 --> 06:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
but we have the task then to review and
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
recommend these
 
06:53:00.910 --> 06:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any further discussions
 
06:53:06.350 --> 06:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
we need to get on to the beyond the
 
06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
discussion stage here yes just just just
 
06:53:08.878 --> 06:53:10.430 align:start position:0%
discussion stage here yes just just just
quickly

06:53:10.430 --> 06:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
06:53:14.330 --> 06:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
um to to in in comparing the oversight
 
06:53:19.968 --> 06:53:19.978 align:start position:0%
committee with what 371 is looking to
 
06:53:23.390 --> 06:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
create 371 is very specific with respect
 
06:53:24.948 --> 06:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
to the minimum
 
06:53:26.628 --> 06:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
um the minimum standards for public
 
06:53:28.910 --> 06:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
school approval the commission shall
 
06:53:31.128 --> 06:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
recommend model minimum standards for
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
public school approval recommend to the
 
06:53:34.910 --> 06:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education rules for
 
06:53:37.010 --> 06:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the minimum standards for
 
06:53:39.350 --> 06:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
public school approval I'm not seeing
 
06:53:42.410 --> 06:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
the parallel in the legislative
 
06:53:46.788 --> 06:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on page 541 so the
 
06:53:51.110 --> 06:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
198 c8a oh sorry 193 c8a
 
06:53:55.128 --> 06:53:55.138 align:start position:0%
um Provisions because what what what the
 
06:54:00.110 --> 06:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:03.650 --> 06:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
is charged with really revolves around
 
06:54:07.850 --> 06:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
198 H which is the accountability
 
06:54:07.860 --> 06:54:09.770 align:start position:0%
198 H which is the accountability
provisions

06:54:09.770 --> 06:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
06:54:12.350 --> 06:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
and not the minimum standards for public
 
06:54:14.570 --> 06:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
school approval
 
06:54:17.448 --> 06:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
so I I see these as two very separate
 
06:54:19.548 --> 06:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
and distinct
 
06:54:19.558 --> 06:54:21.410 align:start position:0%
and distinct
um

06:54:21.410 --> 06:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:21.420 --> 06:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
um
committees

06:54:25.430 --> 06:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:27.288 --> 06:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:54:29.690 --> 06:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna we're getting now into
 
06:54:33.288 --> 06:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
the mode of uh printing a motion on the
 
06:54:35.868 --> 06:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
table here so
 
06:54:35.878 --> 06:54:39.708 align:start position:0%
table here so
um

06:54:39.708 --> 06:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:39.718 --> 06:54:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:54:41.930 --> 06:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:54:41.940 --> 06:54:42.788 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

06:54:42.788 --> 06:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:54:46.010 --> 06:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
this is uh House Bill 371 and I call on
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
the chairman for a motion yes I I move
 
06:54:56.510 --> 06:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:58.190 --> 06:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're a second
 
06:55:01.368 --> 06:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
06:55:04.850 --> 06:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh further well the the comments I have
 
06:55:06.650 --> 06:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
are I think I've already made them in
 
06:55:08.330 --> 06:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
the discussion and it's getting late in
 
06:55:12.650 --> 06:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
the afternoon but uh the the the task I
 
06:55:12.660 --> 06:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
the afternoon but uh the the the task I
believe

06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:55:16.368 --> 06:55:16.378 align:start position:0%
how this is going to be accomplished and
 
06:55:18.948 --> 06:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
how it should be done is that that's
 
06:55:23.650 --> 06:55:23.660 align:start position:0%
outlaid outlined in the statutes already
 
06:55:26.690 --> 06:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
and this provides us the opportunity to
 
06:55:29.090 --> 06:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
get on it immediately
 
06:55:31.430 --> 06:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what the state would
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
ask us to do
 
06:55:36.490 --> 06:55:36.500 align:start position:0%
uh and so I would prefer to
 
06:55:39.110 --> 06:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
accomplish the tasks which you see that
 
06:55:42.128 --> 06:55:42.138 align:start position:0%
outline in 371 through the statutory
 
06:55:44.270 --> 06:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
methodology that's already put in place
 
06:55:46.670 --> 06:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
for us to follow
 
06:55:51.430 --> 06:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:54.350 --> 06:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
for you I make that pretty well covers
 
06:55:56.390 --> 06:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
it thank you great thank you
 
06:55:58.730 --> 06:55:58.740 align:start position:0%

um I think we're getting into uh
 
06:59:35.100 --> 06:59:36.350 align:start position:0%
um I think we're getting into uh
territory

06:59:36.350 --> 06:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
territory
 
06:59:40.490 --> 06:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
um beyond our responsibilities
 
06:59:44.868 --> 06:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
um I I see many uh issues with this bill
 
06:59:47.708 --> 06:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
um educational vendors who are they
 
06:59:50.030 --> 06:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:59:55.070 --> 06:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
um indications that any child in an
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
approved home education program
 
07:00:00.968 --> 07:00:00.978 align:start position:0%
um uh might have this applied to them
 
07:00:04.128 --> 07:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
there are claims
 
07:00:06.170 --> 07:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to the Department of
 
07:00:08.390 --> 07:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
Education for discrimination purposes
 
07:00:10.070 --> 07:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:00:10.080 --> 07:00:10.628 align:start position:0%
which is
um

07:00:10.628 --> 07:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:15.468 --> 07:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
totally uh new um and I don't think in
 
07:00:17.810 --> 07:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
line with the responsibilities of the
 
07:00:20.570 --> 07:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh so I think
 
07:00:24.830 --> 07:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
that this is a uh a reach um you know no
 
07:00:27.650 --> 07:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
one wants to see discrimination but uh
 
07:00:31.010 --> 07:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
this is getting into territory that we
 
07:00:33.230 --> 07:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in I believe
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh further from the maker of the second
 
07:00:39.288 --> 07:00:39.298 align:start position:0%

07:00:39.298 --> 07:00:40.548 align:start position:0%

the the federal laws uh offered by Title
 
07:01:05.208 --> 07:01:05.218 align:start position:0%

07:01:07.128 --> 07:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
they're very basic race religion
 
07:01:07.138 --> 07:01:09.650 align:start position:0%
they're very basic race religion

07:01:09.650 --> 07:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
07:01:11.690 --> 07:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire and its wisdom has
 
07:01:15.048 --> 07:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
expanded protected classes on their
 
07:01:19.788 --> 07:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination bills um to uh
 
07:01:21.948 --> 07:01:21.958 align:start position:0%

07:01:24.890 --> 07:01:24.900 align:start position:0%

07:01:28.310 --> 07:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
Creed you can read it in lines
 
07:01:31.670 --> 07:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
five through ten and our Public Schools
 
07:01:34.968 --> 07:01:34.978 align:start position:0%
abide by that and our Public Schools
 
07:01:36.708 --> 07:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
public charter schools are supposed to
 
07:01:38.930 --> 07:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
abide by as well
 
07:01:40.570 --> 07:01:40.580 align:start position:0%
um I've heard
 
07:01:43.930 --> 07:01:43.940 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that some people have been
 
07:01:48.170 --> 07:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh having the vouchers and going to
 
07:01:49.910 --> 07:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
07:01:52.390 --> 07:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
um have been told they're not a good fit
 
07:01:55.128 --> 07:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
and they belong to the some of these
 
07:01:58.850 --> 07:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
protected classes I don't think that's
 
07:02:00.948 --> 07:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
um what New Hampshire would the people
 
07:02:02.690 --> 07:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would want and
 
07:02:04.128 --> 07:02:04.138 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't think that
 
07:02:06.708 --> 07:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination is fair
 
07:02:09.650 --> 07:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that as far as educational
 
07:02:12.830 --> 07:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
vendors is concerned that we we've had
 
07:02:14.750 --> 07:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
this discussion before there are certain
 
07:02:16.850 --> 07:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
vendors that are approved by not only
 
07:02:19.128 --> 07:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization but also
 
07:02:22.070 --> 07:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the doe certainly
 
07:02:22.080 --> 07:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
the doe certainly
um

07:02:23.030 --> 07:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:27.170 --> 07:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
that that is not a big issue and there
 
07:02:28.730 --> 07:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
is a bill um
 
07:02:30.410 --> 07:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's being heard today
 
07:02:33.410 --> 07:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow uh in which the doe is
 
07:02:33.420 --> 07:02:34.270 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow uh in which the doe is
actually

07:02:34.270 --> 07:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:02:37.330 --> 07:02:37.340 align:start position:0%
asking to be able to receive
 
07:02:40.730 --> 07:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
discrimination complaints so
 
07:02:43.190 --> 07:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that issue is uh that was
 
07:02:45.468 --> 07:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
brought up that the doe isn't set up to
 
07:02:46.968 --> 07:02:46.978 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
07:02:49.788 --> 07:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
take uh discrimination complaints and
 
07:02:52.128 --> 07:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
certainly in this bill it says that the
 
07:02:54.170 --> 07:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
Discrimination complaints can go to the
 
07:02:56.150 --> 07:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or the New
 
07:02:58.490 --> 07:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on human rights and
 
07:02:59.990 --> 07:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Commission on human
 
07:03:02.810 --> 07:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
rights has traditionally been for
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
employment and housing and in employment
 
07:03:07.310 --> 07:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
and housing in the state of New
 
07:03:09.650 --> 07:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all these protected classes
 
07:03:11.628 --> 07:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
are protected
 
07:03:14.150 --> 07:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and recently it's been extended into
 
07:03:16.850 --> 07:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
some educational discrimination cases so
 
07:03:19.070 --> 07:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting
 
07:03:20.810 --> 07:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
um the last time we had this bill there
 
07:03:22.670 --> 07:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
was some discussion whether they were
 
07:03:24.070 --> 07:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
set up to handle education
 
07:03:26.868 --> 07:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination cases than they are I
 
07:03:29.750 --> 07:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
just think it's fair I mean I think we
 
07:03:32.170 --> 07:03:32.180 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility
 
07:03:35.868 --> 07:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
to give a free adequate education to
 
07:03:37.128 --> 07:03:37.138 align:start position:0%
every child
 
07:03:39.708 --> 07:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
all children regardless of where they
 
07:03:41.690 --> 07:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
come from their parents their economic
 
07:03:41.700 --> 07:03:42.670 align:start position:0%
come from their parents their economic
status

07:03:42.670 --> 07:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
status
 
07:03:46.968 --> 07:03:46.978 align:start position:0%
that's what our com that's what my tax
 
07:03:50.750 --> 07:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
payer funded resource funded money
 
07:03:52.968 --> 07:03:52.978 align:start position:0%
should go for that's what I wanted to go
 
07:03:54.830 --> 07:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
for I think that's what the majority of
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire think their
 
07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
money is going for and
 
07:04:01.910 --> 07:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think that with
 
07:04:04.690 --> 07:04:04.700 align:start position:0%
that type of taxpayer resourced money
 
07:04:07.430 --> 07:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
goes accountability and this is just one
 
07:04:10.430 --> 07:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
part of the accountability for it so
 
07:04:14.570 --> 07:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I offer this legislation cordelli
 
07:04:19.250 --> 07:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh two things um first uh
 
07:04:23.090 --> 07:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
the bill related to um complaints uh
 
07:04:24.170 --> 07:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
being sent to the Department of
 
07:04:25.850 --> 07:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
Education was my bill
 
07:04:29.570 --> 07:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
and the issue there was uh in large part
 
07:04:32.390 --> 07:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh complaints being forward to the
 
07:04:33.530 --> 07:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Education by
 
07:04:35.930 --> 07:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
administrators in schools about things
 
07:04:37.548 --> 07:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
that were going on
 
07:04:40.968 --> 07:04:40.978 align:start position:0%
the problem that they ran into was the
 
07:04:43.010 --> 07:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
inability to make referrals to the
 
07:04:44.868 --> 07:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office because it
 
07:04:46.750 --> 07:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't in statute
 
07:04:51.770 --> 07:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office denied
 
07:04:53.810 --> 07:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
um receiving those complaints from the
 
07:04:56.208 --> 07:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
Department of Education based on the
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that has been worked out the
 
07:05:01.850 --> 07:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is now in
 
07:05:03.230 --> 07:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
agreement and they're drawing up
 
07:05:05.150 --> 07:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
language so the Attorney General's
 
07:05:07.490 --> 07:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
office will receive those complaints to
 
07:05:08.868 --> 07:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
take to the Human Rights Commission
 
07:05:13.250 --> 07:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's point one in terms of private
 
07:05:15.590 --> 07:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
schools and discrimination
 
07:05:15.600 --> 07:05:16.208 align:start position:0%
schools and discrimination
um

07:05:16.208 --> 07:05:16.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:19.910 --> 07:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
private schools do not have the taxpayer
 
07:05:23.030 --> 07:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding that public schools have they
 
07:05:26.448 --> 07:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
cannot accommodate some children with
 
07:05:31.190 --> 07:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities they work to make sure that
 
07:05:33.830 --> 07:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
they are not accepting tuition money
 
07:05:36.170 --> 07:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
just to get tuition money and not being
 
07:05:38.930 --> 07:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
able to provide the adequate services to
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
those children with disabilities
 
07:05:41.400 --> 07:05:42.468 align:start position:0%
those children with disabilities
um

07:05:42.468 --> 07:05:42.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
they will tell those families we cannot
 
07:05:49.190 --> 07:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
provide the appropriate services for
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
your child I've got documentation about
 
07:05:56.048 --> 07:05:56.058 align:start position:0%
from the
 
07:05:59.530 --> 07:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
Catholic Church about their
 
07:06:02.208 --> 07:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
inclusion policies for children with
 
07:06:04.208 --> 07:06:04.218 align:start position:0%
disabilities and trying to work with
 
07:06:06.468 --> 07:06:06.478 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities to the best
 
07:06:08.530 --> 07:06:08.540 align:start position:0%
of their ability
 
07:06:13.070 --> 07:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
I uh I wonder with discrimination in
 
07:06:17.650 --> 07:06:17.660 align:start position:0%
private schools would we require a
 
07:06:19.968 --> 07:06:19.978 align:start position:0%
Christian School
 
07:06:24.190 --> 07:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
to accept a teacher applying who
 
07:06:28.850 --> 07:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
believed counter to the faith and be an
 
07:06:30.410 --> 07:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
instructor in that school would that be
 
07:06:33.890 --> 07:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
required as part of this bill Point
 
07:06:36.708 --> 07:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
number two and point number three I
 
07:06:37.850 --> 07:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
don't know if the State Board of
 
07:06:40.670 --> 07:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
Education wants to get involved with uh
 
07:06:43.330 --> 07:06:43.340 align:start position:0%
hearing discrimination cases
 
07:06:47.628 --> 07:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
I think that they probably have enough
 
07:06:49.548 --> 07:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
work on their hands
 
07:06:52.610 --> 07:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Tanner
 
07:06:54.468 --> 07:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to respond to that first
 
07:06:56.570 --> 07:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
of all you'll notice that this bill is
 
07:06:58.730 --> 07:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
about admissions
 
07:07:01.788 --> 07:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
um how the employment again is through
 
07:07:04.310 --> 07:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission and there
 
07:07:07.310 --> 07:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
are specific rules regarding religious
 
07:07:09.770 --> 07:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
schools and their employers there's been
 
07:07:12.170 --> 07:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
a plethora of
 
07:07:15.708 --> 07:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
legal precedences set for that so this
 
07:07:17.628 --> 07:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't even talk to that this is about
 
07:07:21.048 --> 07:07:21.058 align:start position:0%
students and
 
07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
I would say that um one of the things
 
07:07:27.650 --> 07:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
that bothered me the most I think was
 
07:07:27.660 --> 07:07:28.670 align:start position:0%
that bothered me the most I think was
that

07:07:28.670 --> 07:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:07:31.430 --> 07:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
let's say a student has been going in a
 
07:07:33.410 --> 07:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
public school for a number of years and
 
07:07:35.810 --> 07:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
has a disability and that school and
 
07:07:38.030 --> 07:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
part of the part of the issue with
 
07:07:39.948 --> 07:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
school funding with funding public
 
07:07:43.190 --> 07:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
schools and why private schools and
 
07:07:45.530 --> 07:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
um voucher schools are that much cheaper
 
07:07:48.350 --> 07:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
is the fact that public schools if they
 
07:07:49.968 --> 07:07:49.978 align:start position:0%
have somebody with a disability has to
 
07:07:52.310 --> 07:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
have a ramp has to have some way for
 
07:07:53.530 --> 07:07:53.540 align:start position:0%
that child
 
07:07:56.150 --> 07:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of what disability they have
 
07:07:59.930 --> 07:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
to be included in the school we have an
 
07:08:02.090 --> 07:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
inclusion policy where it's the least
 
07:08:04.750 --> 07:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment and
 
07:08:07.670 --> 07:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
so here's a student that's been in a
 
07:08:08.868 --> 07:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
public school and then the parents
 
07:08:10.670 --> 07:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
decide that they would like to and
 
07:08:13.490 --> 07:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps the it's the end of sixth grade
 
07:08:16.850 --> 07:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
and the parents decide that there's no
 
07:08:18.590 --> 07:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
Junior High School that they're out that
 
07:08:19.910 --> 07:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
the kids are all going to a different
 
07:08:22.128 --> 07:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
school and there's a really nice School
 
07:08:26.810 --> 07:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
nearby maybe a Kua or you know a Cole
 
07:08:29.690 --> 07:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
Brown and most of the school kids get
 
07:08:31.610 --> 07:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
into that but this kid with disabilities
 
07:08:34.190 --> 07:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
because she's in a wheelchair or because
 
07:08:36.948 --> 07:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
he has a learning disability that needs
 
07:08:38.510 --> 07:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
special accommodations
 
07:08:41.628 --> 07:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
can't follow their can't with the efas
 
07:08:45.288 --> 07:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
can't follow that into a school I think
 
07:08:48.230 --> 07:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's when you think of it as that or
 
07:08:51.110 --> 07:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that that the kid is um turned
 
07:08:52.548 --> 07:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
away because they're not a good fit
 
07:08:55.368 --> 07:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
because perhaps their parents are
 
07:08:58.490 --> 07:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you know lgbtq
 
07:09:01.730 --> 07:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
um that to me is not what I want my
 
07:09:04.490 --> 07:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money going for that's not what
 
07:09:07.070 --> 07:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
the public good is that's not what
 
07:09:10.850 --> 07:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
um is right in my mind so
 
07:09:10.860 --> 07:09:12.048 align:start position:0%
um is right in my mind so
um

07:09:12.048 --> 07:09:12.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:14.468 --> 07:09:14.478 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald's thank you Mr chair
 
07:09:17.150 --> 07:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
it has been mentioned a number of times
 
07:09:19.548 --> 07:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
that a student might be told they're not
 
07:09:23.570 --> 07:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
a good fit for a program because they
 
07:09:25.070 --> 07:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
are a member of one of these protected
 
07:09:25.080 --> 07:09:26.628 align:start position:0%
are a member of one of these protected
classes

07:09:26.628 --> 07:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
classes
 
07:09:28.310 --> 07:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
but that appears to be an implied
 
07:09:30.650 --> 07:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
causation how are we
 
07:09:32.628 --> 07:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
do we have reason as a committee to
 
07:09:34.850 --> 07:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
believe that it is because they are a
 
07:09:36.170 --> 07:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
part of one of these groups as you
 
07:09:39.708 --> 07:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned a parent could be lgbtq wizard
 
07:09:42.590 --> 07:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
testimony presented that I am not
 
07:09:44.628 --> 07:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
recalling that says that it is because
 
07:09:46.430 --> 07:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
they were one of those or could there be
 
07:09:48.350 --> 07:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
another reason the institution may have
 
07:09:50.390 --> 07:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
for finding someone may not be a good
 
07:09:55.490 --> 07:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:57.948 --> 07:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
yes represent pelcher
 
07:09:59.750 --> 07:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to draw
 
07:10:01.430 --> 07:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
some attention to one particular part
 
07:10:03.288 --> 07:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
that I find a bit curious because most
 
07:10:06.590 --> 07:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
of this proposed Bill the language seeks
 
07:10:08.690 --> 07:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
to expand protected categories but
 
07:10:10.730 --> 07:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
there's one small area that seeks it
 
07:10:13.128 --> 07:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
seems to actually limit protected
 
07:10:15.948 --> 07:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
categories and that's where we see the
 
07:10:18.890 --> 07:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
word creed creed is pre-existing law
 
07:10:21.230 --> 07:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
that is protected already but in this
 
07:10:24.770 --> 07:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill it adds the word religious Creed
 
07:10:26.448 --> 07:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
so it adds the word religious before
 
07:10:29.330 --> 07:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
Creed thereby limiting the scope of
 
07:10:31.548 --> 07:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
creed so I'm wondering if that right
 
07:10:31.558 --> 07:10:32.570 align:start position:0%
creed so I'm wondering if that right
there

07:10:32.570 --> 07:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:10:34.128 --> 07:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
because Creed obviously you could
 
07:10:35.868 --> 07:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean ideological Creed
 
07:10:37.368 --> 07:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
you could interpret that to mean
 
07:10:39.890 --> 07:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
political Creed so I'm wondering if that
 
07:10:41.810 --> 07:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
right there is something that could lead
 
07:10:43.610 --> 07:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
to a political or ideological
 
07:10:46.190 --> 07:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination because it's not outside
 
07:10:49.868 --> 07:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:52.910 --> 07:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
further representative cardelli thank
 
07:10:55.968 --> 07:10:55.978 align:start position:0%
you I just note that the um the first
 
07:10:58.010 --> 07:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
states that implemented
 
07:11:00.410 --> 07:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
um programs for Education savings
 
07:11:04.070 --> 07:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
accounts the primary eligibility student
 
07:11:06.410 --> 07:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
population was children with special
 
07:11:10.690 --> 07:11:10.700 align:start position:0%
needs in all of those first Six States
 
07:11:14.288 --> 07:11:14.298 align:start position:0%
those states have grown
 
07:11:17.570 --> 07:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
parents are finding that they are not
 
07:11:19.610 --> 07:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
getting the services that they think
 
07:11:21.830 --> 07:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
their child needs in the public school
 
07:11:25.490 --> 07:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
and are looking to get their child those
 
07:11:27.490 --> 07:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
Services elsewhere
 
07:11:31.190 --> 07:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
the success of those States in providing
 
07:11:33.650 --> 07:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
education savings accounts to those
 
07:11:36.468 --> 07:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
families is proof of that
 
07:11:39.468 --> 07:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative just a
 
07:11:42.048 --> 07:11:42.058 align:start position:0%
clarification on the word creed it's a
 
07:11:43.788 --> 07:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
statement of a basic belief of a
 
07:11:45.530 --> 07:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
religious fate
 
07:11:47.510 --> 07:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
Faith a system of Christian and other
 
07:11:52.730 --> 07:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:55.430 --> 07:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
07:11:58.190 --> 07:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still confused as to how an
 
07:12:00.650 --> 07:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
online program or an educational vendor
 
07:12:04.250 --> 07:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
can be discriminatory in Admissions and
 
07:12:05.570 --> 07:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
looking for an answer
 
07:12:05.580 --> 07:12:07.730 align:start position:0%
looking for an answer
me

07:12:07.730 --> 07:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:12:09.048 --> 07:12:09.058 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
07:12:11.330 --> 07:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative I think Crete is in
 
07:12:13.910 --> 07:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the original statute it's it's in 300
 
07:12:16.250 --> 07:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
something so we don't have it in our our
 
07:12:16.260 --> 07:12:17.390 align:start position:0%
something so we don't have it in our our
books

07:12:17.390 --> 07:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
books
 
07:12:20.810 --> 07:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
um but I I um as far as the online
 
07:12:20.820 --> 07:12:22.610 align:start position:0%
um but I I um as far as the online
vendors

07:12:22.610 --> 07:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
07:12:25.548 --> 07:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
um again it's admissions so if
 
07:12:31.968 --> 07:12:31.978 align:start position:0%
um say prenda or uh velax has uh courses
 
07:12:33.948 --> 07:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure they they don't do this
 
07:12:35.990 --> 07:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
but that they
 
07:12:39.350 --> 07:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
a vendor like that might discriminate
 
07:12:41.570 --> 07:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
and say this person wasn't wasn't
 
07:12:43.788 --> 07:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
eligible for taking that particular
 
07:12:49.010 --> 07:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
course all up yes what happens if they
 
07:12:51.830 --> 07:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
turn out to be discriminatory
 
07:12:56.090 --> 07:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
well that's I mean the this bill uh it's
 
07:12:56.100 --> 07:12:57.230 align:start position:0%
well that's I mean the this bill uh it's
anything

07:12:57.230 --> 07:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
anything
 
07:12:59.448 --> 07:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
um you know like if you feel you're
 
07:13:02.570 --> 07:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and even though we
 
07:13:04.310 --> 07:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have anyone specifically come
 
07:13:06.048 --> 07:13:06.058 align:start position:0%
into the to the
 
07:13:08.448 --> 07:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
um testify on that there certainly is
 
07:13:11.150 --> 07:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence out there
 
07:13:12.830 --> 07:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
um if you feel you're discriminated
 
07:13:15.948 --> 07:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
against then uh you have someone that
 
07:13:17.390 --> 07:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
you go and Lodge a discrimination
 
07:13:20.090 --> 07:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
complaint with and in this case you know
 
07:13:22.670 --> 07:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
this school superintendent or just like
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
a Title IX complaint you have a person
 
07:13:26.810 --> 07:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
that that's designated within the school
 
07:13:28.850 --> 07:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
to handle those complaints then it goes
 
07:13:30.530 --> 07:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
to the Human Rights Commission usually
 
07:13:34.010 --> 07:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
and they do an investigation to see if
 
07:13:36.650 --> 07:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's actually the cause and then tries
 
07:13:37.670 --> 07:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
to make
 
07:13:41.030 --> 07:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
um some discriminate you know some sort
 
07:13:43.190 --> 07:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
of resolution to it if there isn't a
 
07:13:45.468 --> 07:13:45.478 align:start position:0%
resolution to it they feel a law has
 
07:13:47.150 --> 07:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
been violated then they turn it over to
 
07:13:49.430 --> 07:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and that's how they get
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
involved that's that's how generally
 
07:13:53.690 --> 07:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
discriminating patient cases are handled
 
07:13:55.850 --> 07:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
can I just ask one more yes go ahead so
 
07:13:58.548 --> 07:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
the question my question is
 
07:14:01.548 --> 07:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
and and then if that happens does the
 
07:14:04.730 --> 07:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
money not get spent the written office
 
07:14:07.670 --> 07:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
not being eligible to receive any money
 
07:14:10.010 --> 07:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
anymore or like what happens to somebody
 
07:14:12.048 --> 07:14:12.058 align:start position:0%
if they are ruled on as they've been
 
07:14:12.058 --> 07:14:13.968 align:start position:0%
if they are ruled on as they've been
discriminatory

07:14:13.968 --> 07:14:13.978 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
07:14:17.030 --> 07:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
that that depends on what the
 
07:14:20.628 --> 07:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
judicial area decreased for them to
 
07:14:23.030 --> 07:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
change either they have to change their
 
07:14:26.750 --> 07:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
practices or you know I mean certainly I
 
07:14:28.128 --> 07:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
didn't put in here that they have a
 
07:14:30.650 --> 07:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
civil right of action which occurs in a
 
07:14:31.910 --> 07:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
07:14:34.490 --> 07:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
um bills that we get but I'm sure that
 
07:14:37.910 --> 07:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
if they that that would be one
 
07:14:39.770 --> 07:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
um Avenue that they could take would be
 
07:14:44.030 --> 07:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
as civil rights of of action against
 
07:14:46.208 --> 07:14:46.218 align:start position:0%
um the person or
 
07:14:48.170 --> 07:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
organization that's discriminating
 
07:14:50.750 --> 07:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
against them just it's like
 
07:14:52.850 --> 07:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
anything in the in the state I mean now
 
07:14:55.610 --> 07:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
we have housing and we have employment
 
07:14:58.430 --> 07:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that's generally covered by uh the
 
07:14:59.810 --> 07:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and they've
 
07:15:01.910 --> 07:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
they've had a number of you know they
 
07:15:05.868 --> 07:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
get constant uh complaints so
 
07:15:07.850 --> 07:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
07:15:09.590 --> 07:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to clarify what
 
07:15:11.570 --> 07:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
I said before yes the word creed is in
 
07:15:13.968 --> 07:15:13.978 align:start position:0%
the original existing law but the word
 
07:15:16.128 --> 07:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
religious has been proposed to be added
 
07:15:18.410 --> 07:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
before the word creed and from the
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
Oxford language dictionary the second
 
07:15:22.670 --> 07:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
definition under the word creed a set of
 
07:15:24.530 --> 07:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
beliefs or aims which guide someone's
 
07:15:27.110 --> 07:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
actions so religious is not the only
 
07:15:29.690 --> 07:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
type of creed and you could interpret
 
07:15:32.628 --> 07:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
this very readily as allowing for
 
07:15:34.548 --> 07:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
political or ideological discrimination
 
07:15:36.410 --> 07:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
that does not that does not fall under
 
07:15:38.390 --> 07:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
religion because it adds the word
 
07:15:40.368 --> 07:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
religion before creda
 
07:15:42.770 --> 07:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:15:46.368 --> 07:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:50.110 --> 07:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
the thing that I have an issue with is
 
07:15:54.288 --> 07:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
mental handicaps and my question is
 
07:15:57.230 --> 07:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
if you have a school that is
 
07:15:58.968 --> 07:15:58.978 align:start position:0%
specifically designed or it could be
 
07:16:01.190 --> 07:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
physical handicaps if you have a school
 
07:16:04.430 --> 07:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is specifically designed to take
 
07:16:07.070 --> 07:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
certain students and that's the focus of
 
07:16:09.890 --> 07:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
the school whether it's
 
07:16:12.830 --> 07:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's gifted or somebody who's
 
07:16:17.208 --> 07:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
dyslexic or somebody who's Down syndrome
 
07:16:20.270 --> 07:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
and somebody who doesn't fit into that
 
07:16:20.280 --> 07:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
and somebody who doesn't fit into that
category

07:16:21.590 --> 07:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
category
 
07:16:24.530 --> 07:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
wants to attend that school it wouldn't
 
07:16:26.570 --> 07:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
be a good fit for them
 
07:16:29.448 --> 07:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
and are we going to now claim that they
 
07:16:31.310 --> 07:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
are being discriminated against because
 
07:16:34.670 --> 07:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
whatever they don't fit into that school
 
07:16:37.368 --> 07:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
that's designed to deal with a specific
 
07:16:37.378 --> 07:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
that's designed to deal with a specific
need

07:16:41.990 --> 07:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:45.048 --> 07:16:45.058 align:start position:0%
I'll answer them so you'll see in this
 
07:16:47.270 --> 07:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
in paragraph B where it talks about
 
07:16:50.030 --> 07:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
schools that are set up expressly for
 
07:16:51.430 --> 07:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same sex
 
07:16:54.468 --> 07:16:54.478 align:start position:0%
single sex or to classes or programs or
 
07:16:56.270 --> 07:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
activities in an educational institution
 
07:16:58.548 --> 07:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
that are offered to students of a single
 
07:17:02.030 --> 07:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
sex or who are separated by sex so that
 
07:17:04.610 --> 07:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
covers like all boys schools all girls
 
07:17:07.010 --> 07:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
schools Girl Scouts Boy Scouts whatever
 
07:17:09.890 --> 07:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is
 
07:17:12.288 --> 07:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
um non-protected classes can they be
 
07:17:14.030 --> 07:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
non-protected classes discriminated
 
07:17:16.670 --> 07:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
against these are the people that are
 
07:17:19.430 --> 07:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
listed here these are the categories of
 
07:17:21.350 --> 07:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
protected classes they're there because
 
07:17:25.010 --> 07:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
they have had a history of
 
07:17:28.150 --> 07:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination and therefore have
 
07:17:31.128 --> 07:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
received protected status from the
 
07:17:32.750 --> 07:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
government and from the New Hampshire
 
07:17:35.930 --> 07:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
government and so it pertains to these
 
07:17:40.310 --> 07:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
people applying to a public something
 
07:17:44.448 --> 07:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
that has tax for taxpayer resourced
 
07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
funds public funds
 
07:17:49.968 --> 07:17:49.978 align:start position:0%
um that they should have admissions that
 
07:17:52.250 --> 07:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
does not discriminate against these
 
07:17:52.260 --> 07:17:55.010 align:start position:0%
does not discriminate against these
people

07:17:55.010 --> 07:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:56.868 --> 07:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
now if it
 
07:18:00.288 --> 07:18:00.298 align:start position:0%
fitted in the child isn't gifted
 
07:18:01.730 --> 07:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
07:18:03.708 --> 07:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
that's the the gift it is in a
 
07:18:06.170 --> 07:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
discriminated class but somebody who is
 
07:18:08.690 --> 07:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
maybe they have
 
07:18:08.700 --> 07:18:10.850 align:start position:0%
maybe they have
whatever

07:18:10.850 --> 07:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
07:18:13.910 --> 07:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
you just can't it you can't use gender
 
07:18:16.850 --> 07:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation religious
 
07:18:19.430 --> 07:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
Creed color marital status physical or
 
07:18:21.650 --> 07:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
mental disability national origin
 
07:18:23.510 --> 07:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
ergonomic status
 
07:18:25.968 --> 07:18:25.978 align:start position:0%
that those are the ones the physical or
 
07:18:27.948 --> 07:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
mental disability that's what I'm
 
07:18:30.230 --> 07:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
talking about if their mental disability
 
07:18:34.250 --> 07:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
gifted as a mental disability no if the
 
07:18:37.310 --> 07:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
school is designed for a gifted program
 
07:18:40.128 --> 07:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
yeah and somebody with a mental
 
07:18:42.770 --> 07:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
disability that will preclude them from
 
07:18:45.070 --> 07:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
doing it all well in a gifted program
 
07:18:48.048 --> 07:18:48.058 align:start position:0%
they are a protected class can they say
 
07:18:50.570 --> 07:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
discrimination because they don't get
 
07:18:52.610 --> 07:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
into the gifted school if they're
 
07:18:55.850 --> 07:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
treated any differently than anybody
 
07:18:57.468 --> 07:18:57.478 align:start position:0%
else in other words in order to get into
 
07:18:59.448 --> 07:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
a gifted school I would assume that you
 
07:19:01.128 --> 07:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
have to demonstrate that you're gifted
 
07:19:03.288 --> 07:19:03.298 align:start position:0%
through a test or whatever and if they
 
07:19:05.390 --> 07:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
can perform on that test regardless of
 
07:19:06.890 --> 07:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
whether they're in a wheelchair or not
 
07:19:09.170 --> 07:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed to be in that
 
07:19:11.990 --> 07:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
gifted program if they have
 
07:19:14.708 --> 07:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
um brain injury that
 
07:19:18.110 --> 07:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
precludes them from being or some sort
 
07:19:18.120 --> 07:19:19.250 align:start position:0%
precludes them from being or some sort
of

07:19:19.250 --> 07:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:19:19.260 --> 07:19:20.708 align:start position:0%
of
genetic

07:19:20.708 --> 07:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
genetic
 
07:19:23.570 --> 07:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
problem that keeps them from having the
 
07:19:25.910 --> 07:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
ability to pass that test that's not
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against because of
 
07:19:30.830 --> 07:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
their disability it's be it's they're
 
07:19:32.448 --> 07:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
not getting in because they don't do the
 
07:19:34.730 --> 07:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
tests they can't achieve the gifted
 
07:19:34.740 --> 07:19:37.070 align:start position:0%
tests they can't achieve the gifted
status

07:19:37.070 --> 07:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:37.080 --> 07:19:41.868 align:start position:0%
 
cordelli

07:19:41.868 --> 07:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:43.850 --> 07:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe there's a school in
 
07:19:47.810 --> 07:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh Rochester that um caters to uh
 
07:19:51.110 --> 07:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
students with dyslexia the uh what was
 
07:19:55.548 --> 07:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
the name of Ori uh um Gillingham yeah
 
07:20:00.310 --> 07:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
um uh program and uh so if
 
07:20:05.330 --> 07:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
someone without uh the uh dyslexia issue
 
07:20:08.590 --> 07:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
comes to them and is denied uh admission
 
07:20:12.170 --> 07:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
is that discrimination
 
07:20:14.090 --> 07:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about protected classes
 
07:20:16.430 --> 07:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about protected classes
 
07:20:18.650 --> 07:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
that have that are discriminated against
 
07:20:21.110 --> 07:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
because of how they look
 
07:20:23.448 --> 07:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
what they you know their ability or
 
07:20:25.788 --> 07:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
disability that their sexual orientation
 
07:20:27.230 --> 07:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about we're
 
07:20:29.150 --> 07:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
not talking about
 
07:20:31.310 --> 07:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
schools that are for dyslexic and
 
07:20:34.010 --> 07:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't have dyslexia can't
 
07:20:35.570 --> 07:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
get in
 
07:20:38.330 --> 07:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
if that if somebody has dyslexia and is
 
07:20:40.788 --> 07:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair and is denied access to
 
07:20:42.708 --> 07:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
that school because that school does not
 
07:20:45.948 --> 07:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
have handicap accessibility and doesn't
 
07:20:47.570 --> 07:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
want to give them
 
07:20:50.510 --> 07:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
have them come then yes but if they
 
07:20:52.730 --> 07:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
applied to the school and there's no
 
07:20:54.650 --> 07:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
demonstrated dyslexia and that's what
 
07:20:55.968 --> 07:20:55.978 align:start position:0%
they do
 
07:20:59.570 --> 07:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:02.030 --> 07:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:21:04.730 --> 07:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
I mean we have no more discussion
 
07:21:04.740 --> 07:21:07.128 align:start position:0%
I mean we have no more discussion
wonderful
