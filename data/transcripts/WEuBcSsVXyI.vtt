um with testimony attached to it
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
and so i have
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no idea how long this
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing is going to last this
 
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.030 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i wanted to
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
there are several people
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
that don't realize
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
works differently than uh
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
the other committees in that the lba
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
is the office that
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
takes care of the things that we do and
 
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
takes care of the things that we do and
so

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
if anyone you talk to
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%

okay uh representative cahill would you
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh to start with um
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bill yes thank you very much matt
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
and chair members of the committee out
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'll just uh for the benefit of the
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
public i'll just briefly read the uh
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
the uh written testimony i gave i sent
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
you last night and
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
then talk about a few of the doc
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
supporting documents
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
so hb 594 as passed by the education
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee would begin to address the
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs of schools on the waiting lists
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
and implement a 10-year plan to enable
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
better management
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
for the state and school districts we
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
know the need for improvements will be
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
ongoing much like the other sba the
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
state bridge aid
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
which has a waiting list of over 250 red
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
list municipal bridges
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
we cannot allow our school buildings to
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
decline or to place the entire cost of
 
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.750 align:start position:0%
decline or to place the entire cost of
renovations

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
on property taxpayers a 10-year plan is
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
just a plan unless it is funded in the
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
budget every year
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
the state with a few exceptions has not
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
contributed to the cost of school
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
district projects
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
since 2010 and many communities such as
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
mine were denied even the ability to
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
apply for school building aid
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
this was not because the projects were
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for wants rather than needs
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
but because the legislature would not
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
fund the program
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
when i spoke with governor sununu last
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
week he said he wished the legislature
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
would restore
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
funding that he had to work around it
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
when allocating
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
funds for security infrastructure in the
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
wake of the school shootings
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
i want you to pass hb 594-f
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
but also want you to re to consider what
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
was removed the retroactive funding
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the return to annual bond payments
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
let's look at the project
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
recently approved by the voters in
 
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
recently approved by the voters in
allenstown

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
allenstown
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't pass this bill the this
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
thirty two and
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
thirty two and a half million dollar
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
project will be added to the list of
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
those without state funding
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you pass the bill using the 80 20
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
payment method
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
15.6 million for this single project
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
would use half of the available
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
32 million that's 50 million in the bill
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
minus the debt the tail so what then for
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
the schools ranked a little lower
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
a little further down the list how many
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
of these will be able to wait
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
2 4 or 10 years to rise to the top
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
among the documents i'm submitting for
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
your consideration and the record is a
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
summary of the bond
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the new market project this
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
illustrates two points
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
one we're paying 25 million in interest
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the 30
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
39 million dollar project over 29 years
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
two we're paying an additional three
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifteen cents per thousand
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
until 2046 this is uh on our property
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
taxes this would perhaps be a dollar
 
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.350 align:start position:0%
taxes this would perhaps be a dollar
less

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
if we had our 30 percent uh grant paid
 
00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
if we had our 30 percent uh grant paid
annually

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
so while there would have been savings
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
over using the eighty twenty method
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
receiving a portion of
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
over the life of the bond is preferable
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
to no state funding
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
i ask you to consider doing something
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
retroactively perhaps fifty percent
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
of what the grants would have been for
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
the affected communities
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
this could be spread over a number of
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
years as i would not want to delay work
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the pending projects however
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
i feel it is wrong to punish those whose
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
projects were the victims of bad timing
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
please also redirect the 30 million in
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund to the school
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
building aid program
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
which has served us well for decades
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
so again the let me talking about the
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
we have a long waiting list of schools
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh schools that couldn't even apply
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
schools that were
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
schools that were done during the
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
moratorium and i'm looking at the uh
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the document that miss clark sent i
 
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
the document that miss clark sent i
asked

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
her to send a list of other projects in
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
chronological order
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
and i she noted that these are these are
 
00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:49.670 align:start position:0%
and i she noted that these are these are
not

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
approved or it's an incomplete list
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is a result of a survey was we
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't really track buildings this is
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is what the schools have told us
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
but i note that one is absent i think
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
victim of the moratorium was the
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
stephens high school in claremont that
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
missed the vote
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
missed the margin by one vote someone
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
stayed home to watch dancing with the
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
stars instead of casting a ballot
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
but that was a project i think it was 25
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
million and then
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
they they couldn't get the vote they
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
didn't win so a couple of years later
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
they came back with a much smaller
 
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
they came back with a much smaller
project

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
but again they had to pay the entire
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
cost so
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
let's list projects let's say from salem
 
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
let's list projects let's say from salem
to

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
we have nashua we have the mascoma
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
regional school
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
we have windham projects in hampton
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
all over the state and so this is not
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
just about
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
my community this is about your
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
communities and this is about
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
education something that's important to
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
the young families we hope to move to
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the businesses that would employ
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
them if they had the workforce
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
we can't just continue continue to
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
attract uh
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
seniors who made their money elsewhere
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
and not want to not want to buy a house
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
and not not bring kids we do need the
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
future workforce
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
the current and future workforce also i
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
sent the list of
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the education department has
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
submitted to the school building
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
authority there are 12 schools
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
12 schools on the list and then
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
supporting documents uh behind that and
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
then some of these have
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh structural integrity issues fire and
 
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.150 align:start position:0%
uh structural integrity issues fire and
safety

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh plumbing all all sorts of problems
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just uh the wind that they like
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
a new building because the old ones
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
getting tired
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's structural and safety issues it's
 
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
it's structural and safety issues it's
overcrowding

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
looking again at that list of projects
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
some of them i i think probably wouldn't
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't get building aid
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think if you're if you're making
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
energy improvements the cost savings are
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
enough of an incentive
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i know that some some schools are
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
now doing the uh
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
power sharing so that they're able to
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
have uh their
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
release the the solar units or whatever
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
it is that
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
lowers their energy costs and uh you
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
know they can't get the municipalities
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
can't get the benefit that all the
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
benefits so
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
another entity third party comes in and
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
we still got the cheaper energy
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's saving us money and i
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
think you know also the program needs to
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
be tweaked and that we shouldn't be
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
a new gym floor or perhaps even a new
 
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
a new gym floor or perhaps even a new
furnace

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
furnace
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
those are maintenance items and the
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
towns should be putting something aside
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget every year
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
because it you know a a roof a boiler
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
they have a lifespan and over time
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
you could put something aside but you
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
know renovations
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
we needed renovations i sent you this
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
morning i sent you
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh the testimonial i offered to the to
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
the education committee which included
 
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
the education committee which included
the

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
before and after pictures uh newmarket
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
the high school you know it was first
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
built in 1925
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a beautiful building but you
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
know we've had to add to it kabbalah
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
over the decades and it came to the
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
point where something else had to be
 
00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
point where something else had to be
done

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
even the elementary school which was
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
built in the 90s
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we had a boom we were
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
using modular classrooms
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
for about 30 years and i know there are
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
modular classrooms in many communities
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's not how education should be done
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's not
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
until not a long-term solution so again
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
i want you to pass the bill but i want
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
you to consider the amendments that
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be offered when you're in that
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendments that would bring back uh the
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
retroactive funding
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
and maybe reconsider the 80 20. uh that
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
may work
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
that may work fine and in some cases but
 
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
that may work fine and in some cases but
uh

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to do very very many of
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
the projects if we if we're putting
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
80 up front for all of them
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
bond rates are very low right now this
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
is the time to do it
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
i realized that we got into trouble with
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh bonding years ago
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
and so many high schools were done all
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
at once and so
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh and you know of course if we hadn't
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
done them then they would be costing
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
even more now
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
i've been inside some of those schools
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
and they you know they have
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
stadiums they have uh auditoriums that
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
rival the wang center so i we should
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
also look at what
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
what defines a school i know defining an
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
education has been challenging but what
 
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.269 align:start position:0%
education has been challenging but what
does

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
what's a school building and should we
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
pay for all the extras
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
if a community has the resources and is
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
willing to do
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
to uh spend the money for the bells and
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
whistles then perhaps they should do
 
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
whistles then perhaps they should do
that

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
and we should we should be finding
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools that meet the needs of our
 
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
schools that meet the needs of our
community

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll gladly take any questions you
 
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
and i'll gladly take any questions you
have

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone have any questions that
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
they would like to ask
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
representative heath um thank you

and do you know the amount
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
of funding that would be
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
what what you are looking for
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
in the reimbursement for projects that
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
have been completed
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the moratorium
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
being lifted do you have a an amount
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know the town spent
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
the projects cost 537 million 174
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
495 dollars uh the
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
state the state building aid that would
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
have been provided
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
would be 186 million 141
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
161 dollars give us 50 cents on the
 
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.310 align:start position:0%
161 dollars give us 50 cents on the
dollar

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if you want you know i don't i know
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
you can't just write a check today
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
but you know spread it out warlocks
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
while some of our taxpayers
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
that are helping to pay this are still
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
up above ground and breathing
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh let's help them a little bit i mean
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
the money that you give to us we could
 
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
the money that you give to us we could
put

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
we could lower our tax rates we could
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
again be putting money aside for some of
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
those other education things down the
 
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.430 align:start position:0%
those other education things down the
road

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
and i think it just makes it's the right
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
thing to do rather than just walk away
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
and say
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
well you're out of luck all these
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
communities that we all
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
live in and hope to have children
 
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.470 align:start position:0%
live in and hope to have children
educated

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
educated
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
in uh madam chair may i inquire further
 
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
in uh madam chair may i inquire further
please

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes you may um now
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
um this bill would restore funding
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
to the 50 million level dollar level
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
um but my question to you
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
is i completely think the 10 year plan
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
is an excellent idea however i also
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
understand that number one our budget
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure it out and the
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
amount that you're looking for
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
um may not be realistic
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
but in a 10-year plan
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
we can't go back to building aid as it
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
used to because you know we're still
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
paying off the tail
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it it just ended up a serious
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's back in 2000 2010 that's why we
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
had ended i think was actually 2008 i'm
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
not sure the date
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
um we actually had to bond the payment
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
for building aid because there just
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough money to
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
to balance the budget now in the 10-year
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
plan are we going to look
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
at a different way to approve
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
building projects much like what cte
 
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.190 align:start position:0%
building projects much like what cte
does

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
where they put school districts in a
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
queue and then when that
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
time period comes up then in fact a a
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
project can either be uh approved at the
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
local level or the but the school
 
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
local level or the but the school
district

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
knows when their turn is coming up um
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
is that what you're looking for i don't
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
know that's why i'm asking
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative um yeah i
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
i think the the cte is a good is a good
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
model and i'm glad you brought that up
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
because a few of the
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
a few of the communities that did build
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
salem and dover
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh had the benefit of having ctes which
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
also had the benefit of federal money
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that be nice um
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
the other the other thing with the list
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
is that you know we have a list of
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
projects and
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know someone might come in next
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
year and say well we've been holding off
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
we've been holding off we couldn't do it
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
and now our school is is really worse
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
than the top three
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh so i i think it might be good to have
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
a plan i'm hoping there would be more
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
enough funding so that we could do not
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
just one school
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
every every uh 20 years or every you
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
know but with some frequency in a group
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
of schools
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
this is why i think we have to have we
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
just have to know that this money has to
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
be there
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
and we can't be taking it out with a
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
clever use of a notwithstanding
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you write the budget we the money
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
has to be there
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
it has to come from somewhere so because
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
right now the other document i sent you
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
is the summary
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the new market bond payment if you
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at uh
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
61 million 368 000
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
69 50 69.6 and 53 cents
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're paying for this the whole
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
thing because the state reneged
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm sympathetic to the bond question
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
i know on finance you
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
you guys are the experts and uh figure
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the numbers i don't know what it
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know i i know it would have been
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
less if we if you had
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
if he paid us the 30 percent we would do
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
if you gave us 80
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
up front then we you know that would
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
have been great but you have to do
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
something we can't just continue
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
like this thank you michael
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you are there um further questions
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to just make a statement if
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
i could
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh the reason that we changed to the 80
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
20 methodology
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
was because bond issue after bond issue
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
after bond issue around the state was
 
00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
after bond issue around the state was
failing

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
failing
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
and so the legislature believed
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
that if we were able to provide the 80
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
up front with the 20 at the end
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we would see more bond
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
issues passing now i realize
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
in the last budget cycle we were
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
fortunate that
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
our economy was such that we had
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
ex i don't want to call it extra money
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
but we had
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
money available to do some of the things
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
that uh we we wanted to do and we want
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
every year i mean or every two years i'm
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
i i am also i think dismayed
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
about the um the fact that we have not
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
been able to uh
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
to support the building aid program
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the budget and the
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
money that's available
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
you have to make decisions and
 
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.149 align:start position:0%
you have to make decisions and
unfortunately

00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think that is the position that we are
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
in this cycle
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
i am a little concerned or i i don't
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
i won't argue that 50 million probably
 
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.669 align:start position:0%
i won't argue that 50 million probably
is

00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
is a relatively good figure but
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're struggling right now to fill
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
an 18 million dollar gap in
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
the other issue that i have
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
is that in the last biennium
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
building aid went into the education
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
and your bill as it stands right now
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
moves it out of the education trust fund
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
and back into the general fund
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh where it was before
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
and um so i have i have some
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
real concerns about that um
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think that what we have seen over the
 
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.190 align:start position:0%
i think that what we have seen over the
last

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
four years anyhow is that
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the education trust fund has been
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh relatively healthy
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
whereas the general
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
fund has had some significant
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh significant problems and
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
this year in particular uh the
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
general fund has a huge problem
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
and um so i just wanted to
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
to make that information available to
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
um the committee as well as anybody that
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
senator keith oh madam chad thank you
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for bringing that up
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
um that was an
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
issue that um we really worked hard on
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium and we thought that
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
it would give building aid actually more
 
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.190 align:start position:0%
it would give building aid actually more
protection

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
and then relieve the stress on the
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
so um i would hope that we would in fact
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
leave the building aid within the
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
context of
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
the education trust i thank you for that
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
represent yep
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent caleb yes thank you
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair i
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
i defer to your to your experience and
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
wisdom on these matters of
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
which which kettle the money should come
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
in and out of
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and i do appreciate you know the
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances we find ourselves and i
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know however i also know that you
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know when we think about you know
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the young families that we want to have
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
come and stay in new hampshire that you
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
know if they had to have 80
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
down in order to buy a home home
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
ownership would be nowhere
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so while i don't like debt i
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
don't like paying interest
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
if it's just something that we had to
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
accept and plan for
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
like the alternative is not fixing our
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
schools not fixing our bridges
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
and so that's what unless we like it but
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
i do thank you and i trust the committee
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
will do
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
its best to uh honor our commitments
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very again
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um for the
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
people please remember to raise your
 
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
people please remember to raise your
hand

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak and i
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
see that representative hill has his
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
hand raised
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes manager um i'll i'll try to be brief
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
here uh this is a big topic and
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i think it's maybe the reason that
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh this bill cries out for being
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
retained um i am the
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
chair of the aforementioned school
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
building authority
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
um have been for i think i'm on my
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
second or third year now um this
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
is a project that um that needs reform
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to give you a couple of
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
small pieces for the committee to
 
00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
small pieces for the committee to
consider

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
the the 12 projects that the sponsor
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier i think i
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
if i highlight some of these these
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
some of the difficulties that we have
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
with with school building aid
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
one of the major problems that i see is
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
that these projects
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
can be applied for in june or july
 
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
can be applied for in june or july
actually

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
and it's possible that they have never
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
been approved by the local districts
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
the local voters so you know amy clark
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
at doe the school building authority the
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
board of ed
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
and now you all have to put
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
time effort and energy into evaluating
 
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
time effort and energy into evaluating
projects

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the voters may not even want
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
in fact one sunapee project this year
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
just this last week was voted down by
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
the voters um
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
so all of amy's work um to evaluate that
 
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.950 align:start position:0%
so all of amy's work um to evaluate that
project

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
is is pretty much wasted
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
and and that you know cheap yankee here
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm not happy about wasting time and
 
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.310 align:start position:0%
i i'm not happy about wasting time and
money

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but uh but then we get into
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that's a big problem and and i think
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
six and possibly seven of the
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the 12 projects that are in that
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
category have
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
no voter approval um
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's another three or four here
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
that are going before the voters and
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
have no contingency built in for
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
um for building aid so
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
the assumption is if it passes in that
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
town meeting then they will be building
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
it regardless of
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
building aid we have the three
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
major projects have already been
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the voters
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
and have said that they are building it
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
with or without building aid i have a
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
hard time
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about the poor voters of uh i
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't know lisbon or
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
berlin or somewhere like that paying for
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
a project
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
in salem when the salem
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
or nashua voters have said we're going
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
to build this without
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
with or without building aid so i have a
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
hard time having
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
others chip in for a project like that
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
um then we get into
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
the project that was rated the first on
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
the list
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
which happens to be my district uh
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
um but it is um it was built on a faulty
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
demographic study so the project itself
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
when it came to amy clark
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
um was the project was
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
an expansion of an elementary school
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
that the demographic study
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out to increased demographics
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
student demographics they've since been
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
replicate that demographic study and
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
they've shown decreased
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
populations well here we go again amy is
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
is evaluating a project that um
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
that was um faulty um approved or
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
applied for in the first place so
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think i'll leave it there there's a
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
number of private problems with this
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
project with this
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
this process um not the least of which
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
is the timeline um and that gets to that
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
voter approval or not
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
um i think uh i think a few of us could
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
sit down for a month and
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
and come up with a better solution than
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
what we have here just um
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of money going to
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
if i had my druthers and i don't in the
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the school billing
 
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.029 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the school billing
authority

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
i have no ability to say this is not a
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
good project for the
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers and voters of new
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
only the ability to rank the projects
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
um that's that's kind of
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
a tough position to be in when we have a
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
an authority that is
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is populated with the state fire
 
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.269 align:start position:0%
that is populated with the state fire
marshal

00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
marshal
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer the commissioner of
 
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer the commissioner of
education

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
um another person in finance who happens
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
to be me
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and another a building authority um
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
that all of us are quote unquote experts
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
in our field
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
but all we have the ability to do is
 
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
but all we have the ability to do is
check

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
amy clark's math um on the matrix of
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
of ranking these uh projects with
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
available points
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
um it's the 10-year plan is a great idea
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll absolutely go for that um
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's been a suggestion right
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the get-go
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
but uh the idea of increasing the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
building aid um
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
just because of the request to do
 
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0%
just because of the request to do
something

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
um that's not the right way to go as far
 
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
um that's not the right way to go as far
as

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
as far as i go and i'll leave it there
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative hill uh
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
honorable mr mcguire you have
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
you have uh a comment or a question
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to give sort of
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead i read the hand there um
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
so first of all thank you madam chair
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for welcoming me back
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
to division two uh which was my original
 
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
to division two uh which was my original
committee

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh when i was in the legislature ten
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and before i got sucked
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
into the bottomless poll of division
 
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
into the bottomless poll of division
three

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so today i'm
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the board of granite
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers so what i'm talking
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
about is
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
is you know endorsed or on behalf of
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
granite state taxpayers
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
and um i agree with representative
 
00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
and um i agree with representative
cahill

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
that our demographics is is definitely
 
00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.069 align:start position:0%
that our demographics is is definitely
an

00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
issue new hampshire depending on how you
 
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:27.829 align:start position:0%
issue new hampshire depending on how you
measure

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
is either the second oldest or perhaps
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
the sixth oldest state in the country
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
and but i i question whether
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
building schools is the best way to
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
solve that problem
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
um just in general uh
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
he told a story about
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
there was a district that wanted to
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
build a 25 million dollar school
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't approved and later the voters
 
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.230 align:start position:0%
it wasn't approved and later the voters
approved

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
a lesser project now it seems to us
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
or to me that this is entirely
 
00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
or to me that this is entirely
appropriate

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
because when you subsidize something
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
this particular area subsidizes schools
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
you end up with more of it that's simple
 
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
you end up with more of it that's simple
economics

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
economics
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
so um and this is a problem with
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
government financing in general when one
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
level of government
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
hands a lower level of government money
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
um that government that lower level will
 
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.910 align:start position:0%
um that government that lower level will
spend

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they can afford to
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
spend on that
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
item plus all the stuff that they got
 
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.790 align:start position:0%
item plus all the stuff that they got
handed

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
handed
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
so so the net result of this project
 
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.069 align:start position:0%
so so the net result of this project
program

00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
is that that more
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh schools will be built then
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
then it would happen otherwise then
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
if the same entity that was making the
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
decision to build schools
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
was the one paying for it um
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that you couldn't
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
still i mean if you have 50 million
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
dollars burning a hole in your pocket
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
help out towns right as a really trivial
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
way to help out towns is simply to lower
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax by 50 million
 
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.069 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax by 50 million
dollars

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to be slightly more
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
sophisticated uh and do it by student
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
you could help out towns by uh raising
 
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.390 align:start position:0%
you could help out towns by uh raising
the

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
the um adequate education age
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
five percent and that would be another
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
way to spend 50 million dollars on
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
education but it would be done without
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
the negative consequences of
 
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.950 align:start position:0%
the negative consequences of
overbuilding

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
overbuilding
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
right and and you know i realized that
 
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
right and and you know i realized that
probably

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
people who build large commercial
 
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
people who build large commercial
structures

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
structures
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
would not like that right they want to
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
build stuff
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
but otherwise it would be roughly the
 
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.030 align:start position:0%
but otherwise it would be roughly the
equivalent

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
and you would get schools right sized
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
for their purpose
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you manager thank you uh
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
you have a question i do i
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'm trying to
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
kind of get my head around this
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned that there were
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
communities that were passing
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
bonds with or putting a project up with
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
or without
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
state funding and it seemed to me the
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
implication was
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh the state funding was
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
superfluous and it didn't matter
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
that the state should not be funding
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
projects that
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
would be funded anyway by the community
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if rather we should be
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
is this funding has been so sporadic
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
unreliable and meager in the last years
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
that communities who know they need to
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
repair their school or upgrade their
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
school or
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
build a new one because the one they
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
have is falling down are willing to take
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
realize their responsibility to take it
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
on with or without state funding
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
um so i'm i'm just throwing that out
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
there as a
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you can explain it to me why that
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be a negative
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
for giving um building aid to a
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
community if they're willing to build
 
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
community if they're willing to build
without

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
without it does that make any sense did
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
i make any sense with that
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes you made sense thank you thank
 
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.550 align:start position:0%
uh yes you made sense thank you thank
you

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
did i ask a question no i'm sorry
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
um representative heath i understand you
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a proposed amendment to this bill
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone received it i hope
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
um would you like to
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
um say something about this i i do
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the amendment
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
is to address the concerns that
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative cahill brought
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
up for reconsideration toward those
 
00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
up for reconsideration toward those
projects

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um to some extent that have not been
 
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.870 align:start position:0%
um to some extent that have not been
funded

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
what you're okay let me make sure i'm
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding what you're saying
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
in paragraph in paragraph three
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
which is the new paragraph yes this is
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
the um that's saying that
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
projects between july 13th
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
and 2020 yes maybe
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
may be considered yes okay
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
and you are looking at a
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
award if that's the right yes right term
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
for those
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
um for those back projects
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
raise your hand please
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry about that
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
um i do not have a copy of this
 
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.349 align:start position:0%
um i do not have a copy of this
amendment

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
um when was it sent and was it sent
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
prior to me being
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
put on the committee bob doesn't either
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
i will send the um
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to the entire committee now
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and also post it online but i can also
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
share a screen if that's useful to
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
at least walk through the amendment
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's very hard with amendments
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
right now because
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
um we don't know whether the person is
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
going to offer them or not
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
and and so we we
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh i have tried to make sure that
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
i got these out to everybody but maybe i
 
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.190 align:start position:0%
i got these out to everybody but maybe i
didn't

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay so section three
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
section three is up there uh basically
 
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
section three is up there uh basically
the

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
um if i understood correctly
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
um four
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're also talking about a new
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph on the ten-year plan
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes which is two
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
so let's go to two first
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to three so
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of the um ten-year plan
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think is critical and and i know that
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
amy is out here
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
and i'd like her to perhaps even um give
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
some feedback to that
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
but i just think by having a plan it
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
puts us
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
um in a mode that we have a better
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
handle on the needs that are out there
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
and um the things that we need to have
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
in place to make this
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
work um because of the fact we know we
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
cannot go back to the system
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
the way it was previously so i think if
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
we put together a 10-year plan
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have be able to plan
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
we can budget and we have order in terms
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
of where we're going with building aid
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
mary mary amy
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
would you like to comment on the concept
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
of a 10 year plan
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure for the record amy clark with
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
the department of education school
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
safety and facility management um yeah i
 
00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:47.750 align:start position:0%
safety and facility management um yeah i
think

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
the feedback from schools are that
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
they can't move forward with building a
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
school is not something you do over a
 
00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.510 align:start position:0%
school is not something you do over a
weekend

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's not even something you do in a
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
year's time it typically takes
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
two to five years to plan for a large
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
school construction project
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
but the uncertainty of building aid puts
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
schools um especially poorer schools at
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage because they have to
 
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage because they have to
spend

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
maybe in the realm of a hundred thousand
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
dollars or so
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
for planning for construction really
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
allows the state
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
to um start planning its resources a
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
little bit better instead of just saying
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
oh here's some money
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh who's up for it and then you get the
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
schools that are building anyway
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
um to representative hill's point
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
of some schools are moving forward with
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
construction anyhow
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's not the case with all schools on
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
that list some schools
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
um that were ranked uh did not even vote
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
on building aid because
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh their projects because they were
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
uncertain about building aid where a
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
really gives everybody an idea of when
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
they're up next
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
um should funding be available
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
madam clear if i may yes please go ahead
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i am a former oh i used to work at
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the department of ed
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
and i also was an assistant
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent and passing a bond
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
is extraordinarily hard and i referred
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
to the cte
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
process they have in our capital budget
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
and how well it works
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
because it gives you that time period
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
when you know that your district will be
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
for an award that you have time to work
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
with your community
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
you have time to do the work you need to
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
work um do
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
in order to get it funded um it's not an
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
easy task
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
and for many of us who have worked in
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
districts we know
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
that to get any kind of a bond passed it
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
can take up to
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
two or three years um coming before the
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
budget of
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
the um town committees
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
to get those plans in fact approved
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
so the 10-year plan i think is a logical
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
sequence and it puts in place a
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
structure within which
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
we in the budget committee can work and
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
those folks at the district level can
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
work as well it just it provides order
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
in a structure
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
that um will keep us from falling into
 
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:13.750 align:start position:0%
that um will keep us from falling into
that

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunate situation of having a
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
tail that's
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
been driving us for the last few years
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay does is there anyone else that
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
would like to comment
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the concept of the
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh let me say
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
that i attended
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know some cte committee
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
that i'm on for the state and um
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
they are very concerned about the
 
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.230 align:start position:0%
they are very concerned about the
rotation

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
rotation
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and what's going on in that arena so
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
even though they have a plan um one of
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
the problems that they've had
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that um the school districts
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
that are up for the cte money
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
are not approving the projects so it
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter whether there's a plan
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
or there's not
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's uh unfortunately sometimes
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
um voters are very strange i'll put it
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
so okay representative lynn you have a
 
00:46:26.839 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
so okay representative lynn you have a
question

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and i i really
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
i guess i i
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
direct this to whoever sort of has
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the of the operation of the
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
plan because
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
because candidly i'm i'm just i'm i'm
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
ignorant and i want to i want to
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
learn what this is about but here's i i
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
am i understanding that the way the
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
proposed 10-year plan would work would
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
be the
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
department of education would sort of
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
survey the state
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
and say okay here are and i'm just using
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
this to pick this number out of the air
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
but say okay
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
here are 10 school districts
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
in which new building
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
of of one kind or another is uh
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
um we're going to rank the order in
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
which we the department of education
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
thinks that these should be
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
approved um is is that
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
is that kind of the idea because i i
 
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.230 align:start position:0%
is that kind of the idea because i i
guess

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm having trouble
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is how that
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
and it sort of goes along with what
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative umberger was just saying
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
about the cte
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
program is how does if that's what the
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
the idea of what the state department of
 
00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:50.710 align:start position:0%
the idea of what the state department of
education

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
is supposed to do if that's the idea
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
i kind of wonder how that if that
 
00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
i kind of wonder how that if that
doesn't

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
interfere in some sense with local with
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
local control
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
a district where the where the state
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
department of education might think that
 
00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:12.870 align:start position:0%
department of education might think that
it's

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's high on its list of uh
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh a district where where approval
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
should be given
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
but there's a great debate within the
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
town about whether this should be done
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
um is the
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know is the department of education
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
placing it on the list kind of
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
place putting a hand on the scale there
 
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
place putting a hand on the scale there
um

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
to tip the vote one way or the other
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
and and is that a good idea i guess
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's my that's really my
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh my question in the end
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
amy do you want to uh answer that
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
or is there somebody else here
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
i can i can this is uh representative
 
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.549 align:start position:0%
i can i can this is uh representative
hill

00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
hill
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um i think representative lynn
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
has an excellent point and and um
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
does point out one of the problems
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
with the idea of a 10-year plan and i
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
have seen it in action
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is there is an effect of putting
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
your thumb
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the scale in the current system as
 
00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.549 align:start position:0%
on the scale in the current system as
well

00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
i have seen districts
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
um they came on this matrix
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the and the ranking um near the top
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the list
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
that it was put to the voters um
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
to the effect see uh the state thinks
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
that this is a good project
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
and and are willing to pay for it so
 
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
and and are willing to pay for it so
therefore

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
you should vote for it um because the
 
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.630 align:start position:0%
you should vote for it um because the
state

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
thinks it's a good project so that
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is something to be aware of um
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know it also is difficult and i
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
agree with uh
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
chairman umberger um uh tremendously
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
here because
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
um bricks and mortar are a hard thing to
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh to push through
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
in in good times and yet we're in we're
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
in a position here now
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
where we've had buildings school
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
buildings be empty for
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
a year and people aren't sure whether
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
um their their children will be back in
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
their schools in their
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
in their regular form um they're also
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh see the the statement from the
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education that uh
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
that says for schools to prepare for a
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
future significant declines
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
in population so you can see that
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're hesitant to
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
um to outlay for 20 a building that's
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to be there for 20 years
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
because there is an
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
rsa a piece in the rsa that says
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
if this building isn't used by the end
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh the duration of this that that
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
billing aid could be returned or have to
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
be returned
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's ever taken place
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
but certainly it's an overhanging issue
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
so all of those reasons i agree
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with representative lin
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
that it's a question that needs to be
 
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
that it's a question that needs to be
answered

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have a
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
question i do i just kind of
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
a follow-up um i um
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
fully understand the need
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
for a plan um and i i also want to add
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't put the thumb
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
on the scale of a school district simply
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
because a district would then
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a building project but
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
it allows them
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
to do some planning if in need that's
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
something in
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
their long-term plan there's no
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that they have to do this
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
and there are school districts yes i
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
completely agree
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers across the state are
 
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers across the state are
declining

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
declining
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
but we do have districts that are
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
growing in fact
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
wyndham for example is exploding bedford
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
has seen
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinary growth um the need
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
for building aid remains i think we
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that the pandemic is
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully moving to a conclusion our
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
students will be returning to school
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
and there there continues to be needs um
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
that buildings have
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
in order to move forward so i i
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
just want to protest a little bit the
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
fact that the thumb on the scale
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
because it does not try in any way
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
to usurp local control it simply is
 
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.109 align:start position:0%
to usurp local control it simply is
adding

00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
a plus to what a school district can put
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
into their plans that they are building
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair and i
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
see that representative cahill has a
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
question as well
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
right um representative hill you had
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
some comments that you wanted to make or
 
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
some comments that you wanted to make or
questions

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry i just didn't drop my hand
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
no problem representative cahill thanks
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
very much uh
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
and chair uh to our representative
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative hill's uh statement i i
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
recall like
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
i i think of my first term that
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
lancaster's turn
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
came up for cte at a renovation
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
and they turned it down so it's not
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know the voters still had the final
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
word and uh
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
i also want to add that if not for the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
renovation that we did here in newmarket
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'd have been able to
 
00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:52.230 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'd have been able to
have

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh all our students in the elementary
 
00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:56.230 align:start position:0%
uh all our students in the elementary
school

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
within allowing for the social
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
distancing that we did that
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
and our junior high and senior you know
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
junior senior high school
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
was operational uh nearly all the time
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
except for a couple of exposure
 
00:54:08.079 --> 00:54:09.589 align:start position:0%
except for a couple of exposure
incidents

00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
because we expanded both buildings and
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
if we weren't able to do that
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
it would be a different situation thank
 
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
it would be a different situation thank
you

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative heath would
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
you like to go on to paragraph three
 
00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:23.349 align:start position:0%
you like to go on to paragraph three
please

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
yes so in paragraph
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
three what this does is it opens up an
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity if funds allow
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
to reimburse at the rate of 20 percent
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
those school districts who have indeed
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
gone forward with local building
 
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
gone forward with local building
projects

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
during the period of the moratorium
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's something that if
 
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.789 align:start position:0%
and i think it's something that if
indeed

00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
funds became available that this would
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
be something
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
to try and at least take a step forward
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
to make some of these districts
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
partially whole in terms of what has
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
been asked
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
for them and and i think that
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
has certainly spoke in depth at what
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
the town of newmarket has experienced
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
they had a need they had to go forward
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
and there are many school districts that
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
won't meet our state minimum standards
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
unless they go forward with a building i
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
know that there
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
when i worked as deputy commissioner we
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
had a number of local school districts
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
that because of the condition of their
 
00:55:29.599 --> 00:55:31.109 align:start position:0%
that because of the condition of their
buildings

00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
that they could not get approval and
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
safety hazards um so something had to be
 
00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:38.230 align:start position:0%
safety hazards um so something had to be
done

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
so i think based on the years
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we've seen come before us that the
 
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:45.589 align:start position:0%
that we've seen come before us that the
state

00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
does have some um
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
potential obligation to try and
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
and do something if it would become
 
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.750 align:start position:0%
and do something if it would become
possible

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
but you know i have to say um that
 
00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.670 align:start position:0%
but you know i have to say um that
indeed

00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
i believe that the most important thing
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
re-establish full funding in each year
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
for building aid and secondly
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan or a plan to refigure
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
and that could that will be people
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
coming together
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the plan is going to
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
be under the wise
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
um leadership of amy
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
so i mean these are all things that are
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
critically important to our state
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and schools are not going to go away
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
to have needs across our state schools
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
are a fundamental core
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
of our cities and towns and they will
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else that has any
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes amy if i may
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
i just want to make um too important to
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
what i think are important points
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
is um keep in mind i oftentimes hear
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
about space and cost and
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment and all of that
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
thing keep in mind that the current law
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
already caps the square footage per
 
00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:17.109 align:start position:0%
already caps the square footage per
student

00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
and it cos it caps the cost
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um to of construction so there are
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
lots of large spaces that some local
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
school districts build
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the cap of square
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
footage per student
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
it is um typically smaller than what
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh proposing so um and then so that's
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other point is really that
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
special education space
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
um is much different
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
i will say that there is potentially
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
like when you go in
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
and look at schools there might be some
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
spaces that used to be empty
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
but um special education spaces are
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat significant in school so
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
um those would be the only two points i
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that were
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
muted madam chair well i know that's
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
because i was thinking in my thoughts i
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
i have i have two thoughts here okay
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
um my first
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
on the 10-year plan
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
i've heard the arguments on both sides
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
but there's in my opinion
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
oops nothing wrong with planning
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i agree that if you're
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
building a brand new project that's
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to take you five years to
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
to get it together but i'm not sure
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
how good school boards are
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
at planning for the long term i
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
i i know that
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
all of us um you know have
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
issues with long-term planning but
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
i am personally not opposed
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the the concept of the 10-year plan
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think we have a reality check
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to any funding
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
for this program for this year this
 
00:59:45.119 --> 00:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
for this program for this year this
biennium

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
the question that i have
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
is if people agree
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to change
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
594 to only include
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
the incorporation of a 10-year plan
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
and you know and eliminate all the
 
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
and you know and eliminate all the
others

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
or does it make sense would you prefer
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
to retain the entire bill to
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh try to work on um
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know what what we can do about
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
school building eight
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
i don't expect you know mary
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
you you had you had that money tree
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
growing out there in your backyard okay
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
so those are
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts okay and i would
 
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts okay and i would
um

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
i would just like to to hear from people
 
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.789 align:start position:0%
i would just like to to hear from people
about

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know which is which is the best
 
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:57.829 align:start position:0%
you know which is which is the best
because

01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i i i know all of us know
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we cannot fund this at this time
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative heath um thank you ma'am
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
cheer and thank you for your comments
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
i i would not have a problem at all with
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
it being retained
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
i know that in the last biennium
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
we worked together and there are a lot
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
of these kinds of bills that we were
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
able to get
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
into the um budget and that would be
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
my preference because i think we'd have
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
to go there eventually anyway
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
so um if we were to retain it i would
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
not have a problem with it
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
um i also don't want
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bill um to
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
be itled
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
if in fact the um amendment were not
 
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.109 align:start position:0%
if in fact the um amendment were not
accepted

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
and just to put out there i also have a
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
second amendment
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
that mickey had worked on that took out
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
the um the 20 uh
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
payment back to schools so that would be
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
something that certainly i would
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
entertain too
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
but i number one i'd be happy to have
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
included as written um with the
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
um refund the funding opportunities back
 
01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
um refund the funding opportunities back
to

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
um completed projects
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
but if that becomes a too serious a
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.190 align:start position:0%
but if that becomes a too serious a
liability

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
then i i would re withdraw that section
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
but i do
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
think the consideration of full
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
funding for building aid and the 10-year
 
01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
funding for building aid and the 10-year
plan

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
are two critical elements in long-term
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
for building aid
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
um and if we could do something with
 
01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
um and if we could do something with
that

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
if i may just to clarify the 10-year
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
plan is already in
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 594 as amended and passed
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
by education yeah so that's already in
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
the bill the only change in the
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that we walked through was
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
and you are on mute representative
 
01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
and you are on mute representative
umberger

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative yes is that a motion to
 
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.789 align:start position:0%
representative yes is that a motion to
retain

01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
i would move to retain um house bill
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay do i have a second and then we'll
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
have discussion
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'll second that uh representative petry
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
i had my hand up but it's not to do with
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
i obviously can't vote
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
on this but i had my hand up to clarify
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely i was going to call on
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
you next
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um i do
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
like the 10-year plan um i'm not sure
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to that obviously and i
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure what that cost is i've
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
never heard a cost
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
associated with making this 10-year plan
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's it's not inconsiderable
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
the other part of this and and i'd hate
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
a district like allenstown who voted for
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
this just recently
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
um at least that's my understanding and
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about uh the state
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
portion of their project being 19
 
01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:24.870 align:start position:0%
portion of their project being 19
million

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
which uh along with the tail
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
keeps it under the um or roughly the 50
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
million that we're
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
we're currently dealing with um for
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to i and i'm not even sure
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
if the 19 million is possible in this
 
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
if the 19 million is possible in this
current

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
budget climate but i wanted to
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to make sure that i at
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
least put in a plug to say
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
of all of the 12 projects that are here
 
01:04:52.319 --> 01:04:52.870 align:start position:0%
of all of the 12 projects that are here
from

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
from my position as the chair of the
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
school building authority
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that one um kicks the boxes um
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm i'm cognizant that this
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
year the hall of fame in baseball didn't
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
include anyone and i understand that
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
that can happen
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
but um this is a matrix that um
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
is needs to be worked on um as far as
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill that would be a great
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
piece of it
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
um as well as all of the other items
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned the timeline especially
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i would have no problem retaining but
 
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
so i would have no problem retaining but
i

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
um i only have those two issues the cost
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
and that one project of allenstown that
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
that is in that 60 category meaning that
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
um they are they are
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
a community in need um so they're the
 
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.789 align:start position:0%
a community in need um so they're the
only

01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
they're they're the only 60
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
project that we have and and they are
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
the one that went to uh the district
 
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
the one that went to uh the district
with

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
a contingency that they would only do
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
this if building aid existed
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
which indicates to me that um that
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
billing aid is important to that
 
01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
billing aid is important to that
district

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my plus i'm i'll drop out
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative representative murray
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair um i
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
support the retain but i have a
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think is a technical question there
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
was a discussion
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line six in the original
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
bill in line eight and the other bill
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
but we talked about this money was moved
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund i believe
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
and in the bill it's referring to the
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
state operating budget
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
is that something that we need to change
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
before we retain or do something with
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
no we can we can uh
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
work all of that in the uh retained
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay um seeing no further
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions or con oh represent cahill you
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
want to say something
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for indulging me
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
i'm adam chair
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh again i i did anticipate that because
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
this is a very complicated issue the
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
bill would be retained
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and hopefully during that period the
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
revenues will continue to climb and
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the whole will be a little bit
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh less deep but i also wanted to add as
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
far as the retroactive many of the
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
schools including new market
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
also had those kind of issues
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
overcrowding unsafe conditions firing
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
life safety
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
so we checked a lot of boxes we just
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
didn't get a check
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you

grow
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit faster than what we have at
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%

newbie question
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
so please forgive my ignorance when
 
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
so please forgive my ignorance when
working

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
were the proposed
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
um tax cuts that the governor
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
asked for included as part of that
 
01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:38.950 align:start position:0%
asked for included as part of that
revenue

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
estimate or those in the future so
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
he correct me if i'm wrong but i believe
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
they were included in the revenue
 
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
they were included in the revenue
estimates

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct the base revenues
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
are stated and then any changes to um
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
tax rates tax law anything that would
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
affect revenues are carried on the
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
surplus statement as a revenue
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment so all those changes are
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
okay so can i have a follow-up certainly
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we're working with figures that are
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um under the influence of
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
that any negative influence of covid
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
reduced by the cuts that are made
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the tax rates so that's why our
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh the yeah where they are that's i
 
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.189 align:start position:0%
uh the yeah where they are that's i
think

01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
i think the estimates from the tax cut
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
did not um reduce
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
the income the revenue
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh by any uh
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount i
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
i am i think the governor
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
was uh very uh
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
he felt very strongly as did the folks
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
working on the budget
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
that with the tax cuts uh it would not
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
affect the revenues and i i don't have
 
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:10.709 align:start position:0%
affect the revenues and i i don't have
them

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
just handy right here but so there's
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
been enough of a rebound then
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay let's see
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
turning to 6 13
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
hill man of chair okay
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
did you want to uh talk about this
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh i know you had said
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you um had some
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendments to this but nothing has
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
gotten to mickey from lost
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh neither neither to me as well um
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
i had promised i would get it to you as
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
soon as i received it from ols i've not
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
seen it but it um it really is not
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
critical to uh to our discussion today
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
um it it can certainly be handled
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
um on on the senate side if it if the
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill gets that far
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
well except that the last thing i saw
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that you were deleting
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and again you know all all
 
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:33.210 align:start position:0%
references to uh
 
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
references to uh
[Applause]

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
to the original bill yeah in
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the state education special education
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
state aid which was changing it from
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
three and a half to two and a half but
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh anyhow
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'll let you if you don't mind i'll let
 
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.110 align:start position:0%
i'll let you if you don't mind i'll let
you

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh talk about um talk about this bill
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't mind at all i i appreciate
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
um it uh the original bill
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh this really could be two bills um
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
one part uh which you correctly just
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
um is the special education state aid
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's the first
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
page first full page and and probably a
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
third of this
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
second page um that is a
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh is written to expand the formula of
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
how many children qualify for at least
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
some state funding
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was the original bill um
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill came in as
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment and that was
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
primarily because the information that
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
came from um the actuary that the doe
 
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
came from um the actuary that the doe
hired

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
hired
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
the report and the tool came in in
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
december and it was
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
after the time that a separate bill
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
could be written
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
so it was merely um amended on to this
 
01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
so it was merely um amended on to this
bill

01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the new amendment that uh we just
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the goal was to try to get
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
rid of the indi
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the original language um for
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
for expanding the formula of how many
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
children qualify
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
that didn't seem to fix the problem that
 
01:15:16.159 --> 01:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
that didn't seem to fix the problem that
um

01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to address and uh
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
and that problem is is something that
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
all recognize the problem when high-cost
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
special ed children move into a district
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
after the school
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
district's budget is set
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
districts worry about this situation and
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
they put away money into rainy day
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
capital reserve
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
accounts uh just last year 117 districts
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
put away
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
six million dollars into these types of
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
six million dollars into these types of
accounts

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
um this part of hb 613
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
lets districts create municipal risk
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
pools of the type that are shown in rsa
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
5b municipal municipal
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
risk pools are so common that they have
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
a national association
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
called a grip for some reason i i'm not
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure what that
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
acronym means um i spoke with the
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
executive director to see if any of her
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
members used
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
municipal risk pools for special ed
 
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.070 align:start position:0%
municipal risk pools for special ed
costs

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
she didn't think any of them did
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
but she was very excited about the
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
prospect and promised her
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
organization support most municipal risk
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
pools and in fact the three that are
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
currently operating in new hampshire
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
risk pools in new hampshire are overseen
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
specifically the director of securities
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
who i also spoke with
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
he said that the rsa would need to be
 
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.189 align:start position:0%
he said that the rsa would need to be
changed

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
to allow special ed to be an approved
 
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.709 align:start position:0%
to allow special ed to be an approved
use

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
this bill does that the director said
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
the association's
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers would draft their own documents
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
spelling out the parameters of the risk
 
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.709 align:start position:0%
spelling out the parameters of the risk
pool

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be the governing document
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
that he would oversee
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
he said he would first make sure that
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the risk pool followed the parameters of
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
the existing rsa
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
the key reason we are enthusiastic about
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
risk pools in new hampshire is because
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the analysis done by
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
our actuaries from our own department of
 
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.189 align:start position:0%
our actuaries from our own department of
insurance

01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
the analysis showed that even those
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
can show wide fluctuations in yearly
 
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
can show wide fluctuations in yearly
costs

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the fact it remains that the costs
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
remain fairly predictable
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
statewide the actuary from the
 
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
statewide the actuary from the
department

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
is on this zoom call to explain more
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
about this phenomenon
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
predictability is a good thing if
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
associations are going to seek third
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
party insurance coverage
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
or perhaps they may choose to still
 
01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:57.350 align:start position:0%
or perhaps they may choose to still
self-insure

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
we had on the zoom call as well um
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
who just sent me a note saying she had
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
to leave for
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
another meeting um is the uh
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
vice president of the actuary firm that
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
was hired by the doe last year to do
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
further analysis
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
of our historic historical special ed
 
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
of our historic historical special ed
data

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
and build us what we call a special ed
 
01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
and build us what we call a special ed
cost

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
predictor which is something that the
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
doe now has
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
in its possession this tool will help
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
the risk pools accurately determine how
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
much money
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
they will need to be paid into member
 
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
they will need to be paid into member
district

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
school districts cover their concerns of
 
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
school districts cover their concerns of
unexpected

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
unexpected
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
and unreimbursed special ed costs
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very easy tool to use one page of
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
inputs one page of outputs
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it's all in common use language i've
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
provided the committee a sample
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
from the town of payroll which is rick
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
glad's district
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
this tool helps immediately because it
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
would guide districts to suggest
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
how much of the district how much the
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
district needs to have in their rainy
 
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:04.950 align:start position:0%
district needs to have in their rainy
day

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
self-insurance pool as it stands now
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
districts don't know whether the money
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
they are putting away in these rainy day
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
accounts is too much
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
or too little some districts have
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
millions in these accounts and one
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
district has 46 dollars
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
they have no idea how much they need
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
this tool works now
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
but it would need to be updated with the
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
data the doe already collects
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
for privacy reasons the doe needs to be
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
the point person for updating this cost
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
predictor tool
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that gives you a basis for
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
what house bill 613 can do
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to answer questions but um
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps the actuary on the line can also
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
answer any technical questions
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
his name is chris citarella and i think
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
i saw him listed in
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm all set okay
 
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm all set okay
uh

01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
dan did you want to testify or did you
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay then i will let uh if you don't
 
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.110 align:start position:0%
okay then i will let uh if you don't
mind

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
i will let our committee members ask
 
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.550 align:start position:0%
i will let our committee members ask
questions

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
of uh representative
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
hill as well as uh
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
mr citorelli i think he's up someplace
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
there he is all right great so
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you men of chair i i don't
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem with any of
 
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem with any of
this

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually um it's an interesting concept
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i think the potential is there
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
my my concern is that we've not had a
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this element and
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know just um working with local
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that every school
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
district has
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they may very well be in favor of it
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and want it um i
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
just don't know and i i see that um we
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
person from the department here but we
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't have any i don't see anybody in
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
the audience from local school districts
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
so that's i just wanted to put my
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that this is and it deviates from the
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
usual practice that we've had
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
in place for many many years um and um
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
i just think would be nice to hear from
 
01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.550 align:start position:0%
i just think would be nice to hear from
other

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
places in terms of of what they
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
feel about moving in this direction
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question um the
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
the bill did have a a a hearing in house
 
01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
the bill did have a a a hearing in house
education

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
um it um it
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
drew pretty much the same comments um in
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is a new idea i want to
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
specifically stress that this is
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation this
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
merely makes it possible for districts
 
01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.229 align:start position:0%
merely makes it possible for districts
to

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
to evaluate on their own band together
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
create a risk pool draw their own
 
01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
create a risk pool draw their own
document

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
and and have that overseen by the
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
director of securities and the secretary
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
of state's office
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um it is not anything
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
um it was brought up that this needs to
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
be studied more
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
um we've had two and a half years or so
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
of studying with uh with the help of the
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
department of insurance as well as the
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
outside actuaries that the department of
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
education hired
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have the report i'm happy to make the
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
report available to you
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
it is it is an idea
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
that is new for this purpose
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
but it is an old idea for um
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
the idea of solving problems within
 
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.510 align:start position:0%
the idea of solving problems within
municipalities

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
um it's really not much different than
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
what we do with
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
um with mutual aid for fire districts
 
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.629 align:start position:0%
um with mutual aid for fire districts
currently

01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
um mutual aid is where uh
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
several districts agree to uh to cover
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
each other if there is a
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh a fire in a different area this
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat on that same idea that
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
districts would ban
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
together and agree to to help out
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
and and ensure each other um
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
on the event that some some unrecognized
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
event happens after their
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
their school district has been set in
 
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.030 align:start position:0%
their school district has been set in
stone

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
stone
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you rep some hill representative
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
turcotte you have a question
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
i do good morning representative hill i
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is for you or maybe
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
christian later
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh three points that i'd uh ask you to
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
maybe get back with me
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
um probably don't need to do it right
 
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
um probably don't need to do it right
here

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
number one what is the definition
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
of a special ed student i know it sounds
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
basic but
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty new at this stuff
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire how many
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
special ed students qualify and then my
 
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
special ed students qualify and then my
third

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
question these are all kind of data
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
points for me i guess
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
is say in the last 10 years what has
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
been the
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh increase in the number of special ed
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire that's it
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i actually think chris would be the
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
perfect guy
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
for uh for those uh those questions um
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
if it's possible that we um
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
pull him up or is how would you like to
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%

he's he's up already uh
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
did we was that part uh the questions
 
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
did we was that part uh the questions
that

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative got was that part of
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
what um doe provided to us
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the in that stack it could be but i
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
do have rebecca fredette from the
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
department here who
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
put that information together to answer
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
any questions specific to it
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
if she'd like to respond
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh rebecca i'd love for you to
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
respond if you would
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
sure so um a definition of a special
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
education student would be any student
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
identified under idea um as a student in
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
need of
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
special education due to a disability um
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
as outlined in idea currently we have
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
um i don't have the exact number right
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
in front of me unfortunately
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm working from home and didn't get it
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
pulled up but it is just over 30
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
000 in the entire state right now um
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at just special
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
education aid and those that meet cap
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
last year we had 742 students who
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
applied for special education aid
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
so that is those are those students that
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
have those high cost
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
needs that we're talking about here with
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative hill's
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
information and um
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
they met cap at which was set at 59 217
 
01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.070 align:start position:0%
they met cap at which was set at 59 217
dollars

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
and there so their costs went above that
 
01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
and there so their costs went above that
amount

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
and then your next um question was i
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
think you're the next one was the
 
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
think you're the next one was the
numbers

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me that was that was at the three
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
and a half percent is that correct
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
rather than three and a half percent yes
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
it is three and a half times yep i'm
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
sorry yes it's times
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
um and then the increase um for this
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
increase of special ed students over the
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
past 10 years so in 2010
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
we had 1 154 students apply for special
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
education aid
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
and at that point the cap was um 41
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.189 align:start position:0%
and at that point the cap was um 41
thousand

01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
does that answer your questions
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte um
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much the first one on the
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
definition do is there someplace that i
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
can actually look at that or is that
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
something you can
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
cut and send to me sure i can i can find
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that information for you yes thank you
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
it might help uh representative turcotte
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
to know there's 13 different
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
special ed categories that that students
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
fit into i see uh representative heath
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
smiling here i think
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
she probably had a hand in putting those
 
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
she probably had a hand in putting those
together

01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
but um so i feel a little silly asking
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
at the feet of the master here
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
um but it is um
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
each of those um in this cost predictor
 
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.350 align:start position:0%
each of those um in this cost predictor
tool

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
um the students are identified um in
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
which of those categories or multiple
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
categories that they
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
that they fall into and and so that cost
 
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
that they fall into and and so that cost
predictor

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
predictor
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
takes that that very private information
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
and um and puts it into uh this excel
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that provides the estimated cost
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
sorry misters
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's cinderella yeah
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
i had turned it over on the on the back
 
01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.030 align:start position:0%
i had turned it over on the on the back
so

01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh did you have anything you wanted to
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
add to this
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
i i i really don't i didn't want to i
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to take any time more time i
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
i think representative hilton
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
did a fine job explaining i'll just say
 
01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
did a fine job explaining i'll just say
that

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
my role was i'm i'm a property and
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
casualty actuary at the new hampshire
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
um commissioner edelblut
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
and representative hill came to me about
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
what is it now about two
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
at least two years ago said do you think
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
insurable risk and um
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
and it there is no insurance product out
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
there right now
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
that handles this type of situation and
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know you know i'm i'm hesitant to
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
say that it is
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is a traditional insurable risk from
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the property and casualty side and the
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
idea of a liability
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
um you know just to make a long story
 
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.510 align:start position:0%
um you know just to make a long story
short

01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
i did an analysis and it does appear as
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the representative said it does appear
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be fairly
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
stable in aggregate
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
and there appear to be some predictors
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
as to what
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
would drive costs for an individual
 
01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.310 align:start position:0%
would drive costs for an individual
district

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and so it appears as if a risk pool
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
in this situation um and so i
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
i did a as i said i did a you know a
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
high level analysis
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and reported the back recommended that
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
they go to a more
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
experienced firm that dealt with because
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
it does have
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
more tendencies or more characteristics
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
life or a health product rather than a
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
property and casualty product and
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
this tool i've looked at the tool and i
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
will say it is
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
it is a good it is a good tool it is a
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
good um
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
cost so data that was provided
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh rebecca
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
are you the person that would uh
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
manage or update this uh data system
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
so we um greg representative hill would
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to give the correct terminology for
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
this but we
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
would um put out an rfp to have this
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
updated based on our data
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
each year so it wouldn't be my office
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
that necessarily does it but we would
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
reach out again
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
each year and have the um the data
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
updated according to our numbers in
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a cost estimate on that
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative hill because
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
i didn't see anything in
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
um the estimate um that was received and
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the woman that was on the
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
line that uh would be the
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
the person she's the vice president of
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
the actuary firm in kansas
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh lewis and ellis um is the
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
is the actuary firm she would be the
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
logical one to
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
since they built this cost predictor she
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be the logical one
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
to to provide future updates
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
for it she gave me only a verbal
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
um off the cuff saying you know it would
 
01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:20.950 align:start position:0%
um off the cuff saying you know it would
be

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh less than half of what they paid to
 
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.149 align:start position:0%
uh less than half of what they paid to
build

01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
build
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
the system um and it would also depend
 
01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.510 align:start position:0%
the system um and it would also depend
on

01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
what other changes the the associations
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the school districts
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to see in in the product um
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
she would assume she was assuming that
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
they were building it
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
based on what they would like but they
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
had no idea whether it be something that
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the districts wouldn't offer
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
um changes to in in a current year so
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
she was hesitant to come out with a
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
fixed price and say here's here's what
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
but the um it's set up in the bill that
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
would um would do the rfp
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um would also um handle the cost
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
for that for the first five years with
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
the idea that that would be the setup
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
time period
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and and then at that point the
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
associations that had been formed
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the state would pick up the
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
of that um that updating that
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh they they figured this cost predictor
 
01:32:22.239 --> 01:32:23.270 align:start position:0%
uh they they figured this cost predictor
works

01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
for about three years before the data is
 
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
for about three years before the data is
stale

01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
stale
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
and and needs to be updated so um
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
that that may or may not be helpful i
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful it is
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh i've got all that but
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
as i recall the rfp was roughly uh
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
a hundred and ten thousand dollars to
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
build this
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking um if we were in the
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 50
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
50 000 um i i can't see we would be much
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay well i can i can second that
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
estimate there having been in the uh
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
prior to my current life
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh my current career i was in the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
holding worlds for electrical services
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
and you know have even half of the
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
initial costs
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay so this would be um
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
50 000 a year is that correct
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
50 000 whenever they update um
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
and and it doesn't have to be done on an
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
annual basis it can be done
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
whenever the doe determines that the
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
numbers have significantly changed
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
so um you know the idea would be that
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
there would be a three-year contract or
 
01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:52.629 align:start position:0%
there would be a three-year contract or
some

01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
something like that with the rfp process
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
that was what the commissioner had
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
um so that every once every three years
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the data would be updated
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair um so
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
again i'm talking on behalf of granite
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers and i'm only going to
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
address the the first part of the bill
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
the main part of the bill not the
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
pooling thing i don't have anything to
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
say on that subject
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so the main part of the bill
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
essentially just
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
changes the formula by which the state
 
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
changes the formula by which the state
uh

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
helps localities with special ed aid
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the way that works is uh there's this
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
cutoff of sixty thousand dollars
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so the first sixty thousand dollars
 
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:53.910 align:start position:0%
um so the first sixty thousand dollars
that

01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
that a cost of a kid is entirely born by
 
01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
locals um then after that
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
up to i think it's
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure maybe a hundred times 10
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
times yeah
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's about 17 170 000
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
the state pays what is it seventy
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
percent sixty percent
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
eighty twenty it's eighty it's never
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
eighty twenty but that's the goal okay
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the goal is eighty percent of
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
of the intermediate the amount between
 
01:35:27.679 --> 01:35:28.149 align:start position:0%
of the intermediate the amount between
60

01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
60
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
000 and 170 000 and then greater than
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
000 and 170 000 and then greater than
170

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
170
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
000 state pays 100 so um
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and i believe that the total amount
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
the state has been
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
putting into this area over time is
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
is relatively flat so so it's it's not
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
um it's not unreasonable
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
to say uh you know due to inflation or
 
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
to say uh you know due to inflation or
whatever

01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that um this this area could be
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
expanded slightly and what this bill
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
does is change that 60
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
000 um number
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
down to 45 000 or something like that
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
right so that
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
so that the place where the state a
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
kicks in is much lower
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's not necessarily
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonable but
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
um one thing that you notice if you
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
delve into this
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
in more detail is that uh special ed
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
spending is not at all uniform
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
across the state and very in different
 
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.590 align:start position:0%
across the state and very in different
municipalities

01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
um if you take uh what manchester spends
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
on average per student on special ed or
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe what manchester and nashua spend
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
as a as a baseline sort of you'll find
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
that certain communities
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and even large communities spend
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
much higher numbers than those you know
 
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.109 align:start position:0%
much higher numbers than those you know
per

01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
per student in particular uh if you look
 
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
per student in particular uh if you look
at

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh merrimack the town of merrimack which
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
is about the
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
third size of manchester but it's
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
spending in this area or
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
or what it receives from the state in
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
is something like two-thirds of what
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
manchester gets
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
so you know it's it's twice the rate of
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
manchester in some sense
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
and and there are other towns like that
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
like over
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh possibly salem and others so if you
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
you actually look at the details
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
you'll find that that certain towns
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
are are overly generous in my opinion
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
um compared to the the standard
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
of what special ed should be and i think
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for that
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
is that the department of ed has
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
essentially zero control
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
or influence over how much
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
special ed spending is i mean i think
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
they simply
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask the question how much did you spend
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
run through the formula and send a check
 
01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.830 align:start position:0%
run through the formula and send a check
so

01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
i would think that in this area if you
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to change the formula to be
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
state spends more you could profitably
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
add a handful of auditors to the
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
who would periodically look at you know
 
01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
who would periodically look at you know
sample

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
sample
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
the the special ed spending decisions of
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
each town
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps have the power to deny
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh a fraction of their spending
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
as far as being used in the formula and
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that would pay for itself i think
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
you could you could spend
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know you could do a certain amount
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
of auditing
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
and um and and you would end up
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
not spending that you know not spending
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
that much on this on this extra um
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
benefit so that that's my suggestion
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i i i see some hands raised so i'm
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
fully prepared to say that i'm wrong
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
but um but my
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
my it's definitely the case that some
 
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.629 align:start position:0%
my it's definitely the case that some
towns

01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
are spending uh a lot more than others
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
per pupil and and in to the extent that
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
it it seems like um if the state wants
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
to put money in it should require that
 
01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:15.510 align:start position:0%
to put money in it should require that
towns

01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
make more uniform decisions thank you
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much uh representative
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
heath you have your
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
hand raised oh yes thank you madam chair
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the cost that a school district
 
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
that the cost that a school district
incurs

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
incurs
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of special education costs
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
are driven by the individual students
 
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.669 align:start position:0%
are driven by the individual students
iep

01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
iep
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
and i think rebecca can talk to the
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
specifics of that
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not something that is um
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not a school district
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
spends more or less per se but that
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's based on the federal
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation as well as our own state
 
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.109 align:start position:0%
legislation as well as our own state
standards

01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's based on the needs that have been
 
01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.229 align:start position:0%
it's based on the needs that have been
articulated

01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
articulated
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
as a result of the team meetings based
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the needs
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
documented in the individual students
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
iep thank you very much madam chair
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh rebecca would you like
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
to comment on that
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
at all certainly so i can briefly share
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
with you the process we have for special
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
education aid in our
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
office each district that is applying
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
for special education aid
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
submits all of their paperwork to us by
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um excuse me july 30th
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
of each year and then we hire
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
up to six clerks in our office each year
 
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.070 align:start position:0%
up to six clerks in our office each year
um

01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
to review all of those submissions and
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
what we do is we
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
um to make the convoluted process a
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
little shorter we
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
look at all of their submissions and
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
invoices and when we
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
tie it back to a specific service within
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
the student's iep
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
so if they submit to us something for
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
transportation say
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we look at the iep and it is not
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
there we would then deny that
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
claim because it's not tied directly to
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
a student's iep
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
but um we pick a number of districts
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
each year that we do that for and we
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
review them intensively
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
um we do a for all of them we don't
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
review them intensively but we do pick a
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
certain number of them that we
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
review intensely each year and that's on
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
a cyclical basis
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
so every three years your district would
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
come up and we would review your
 
01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.629 align:start position:0%
come up and we would review your
submissions

01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
submissions
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they tied back to each um
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
each service within an individual
 
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
each service within an individual
student's

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
student's
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
iep and there are times that we do deny
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
claims um we
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a documentation that that
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
service was
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
within the student's iep we would deny
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
that claim
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but that is only for students that
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
are submitted to us we don't do that for
 
01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:44.149 align:start position:0%
are submitted to us we don't do that for
every

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
district um and every process for every
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
student it's only for those that are
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to us
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
for special education aid reimbursement
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative berger thank you yes uh
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter you had a
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.229 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter you had a
question

01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure it's more of a
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
comment is that all right
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
i will let you make a short comment
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
how's that thank you
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
um just for the record here um i have to
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative heath
 
01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.149 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative heath
said

01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
about the needs of the children and how
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
much those needs cost
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
versus just a general average i know in
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
our district we have a very loving
 
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.550 align:start position:0%
our district we have a very loving
family

01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
who has adopted into their families
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
seven children with severe disabilities
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
that cost the district a significant
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and in that's one what
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
reason why our costs might be higher
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
than the neighboring
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
community that does not have such a
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
family there
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
and also one way that we have tried in
 
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:49.830 align:start position:0%
and also one way that we have tried in
hillsborough

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
to keep our costs down is by offering
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
our own alternative programs here rather
 
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.709 align:start position:0%
our own alternative programs here rather
than

01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
having our students be a scholar you
 
01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:00.709 align:start position:0%
having our students be a scholar you
know

01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship out to other programs and we
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
invite other
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
children to come into our programs in
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
our town
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can save the district money
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
so there
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
are things that um schools and school
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
districts do
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that they have no control over and there
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
are some that they do have control over
 
01:43:19.199 --> 01:43:19.669 align:start position:0%
are some that they do have control over
but

01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
the amount that a district pays for its
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
students is determined by the needs of
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
the students and not by
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
having a cadillac program that they're
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
giving to everybody
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
our representative honorable
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll just call you dan it's like
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember all this thank
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah so
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
the point i was trying to make was not
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
the level of auditing that was just
 
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.270 align:start position:0%
the level of auditing that was just
described

01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
that okay a bill was submitted and
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
therefore and and therefore we checked
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
that that bill matches the iep what i'm
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
talking about is in more detail than
 
01:44:01.199 --> 01:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
talking about is in more detail than
that

01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
it's the creation of the iep
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
because i don't think it's necessarily
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
the case that if you that an identical
 
01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.790 align:start position:0%
the case that if you that an identical
student

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
in one town is going to get the same iep
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
then and then in another town right the
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
creation of the iep
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a is a a negotiation process
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
among multiple individuals and i would
 
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.310 align:start position:0%
among multiple individuals and i would
think

01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it seems likely to me that that that
 
01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
and it seems likely to me that that that
negotiation

01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
has would have different out results in
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
different towns and certain towns
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh would be more expansive or generous
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
or however you want to say it than than
 
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
or however you want to say it than than
others

01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
and so if the state is putting money
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
into this area
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
i would think it would want to take a
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
sampling of ieps and say yes
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
you you know produce this iep reasonably
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
or no you haven't and have some control
 
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
or no you haven't and have some control
over

01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any more comments or
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions at this point
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay i have uh one comment um
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair i just received from ols the
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we had talked about so i
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
have forwarded that to
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i here's my
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
thought process on this again um
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
i think the concept of the
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
insurance is interesting to explore
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh unfortunately
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
we did not have the amendment as we were
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
going through what we what we needed
 
01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.310 align:start position:0%
going through what we what we needed
today

01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
if i could have a motion to retain
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
that it would give us an opportunity
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
to um look further
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i i think that um representative
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
hill has done a lot of work on this
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
information i guess that's the right
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
term that he is
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
holding in his head and on the papers
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
so um i would i would appreciate
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
if uh if we could do that
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative heath are you making the
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%

it's my pleasure to recommend that we
retain

01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%

um being here today and
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
i will say that although i read the bill
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh and i think this is a
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
extremely interesting concept and
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know i don't know whether um
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
anybody any of the communities would uh
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
take up this uh insurance proposal
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
but um it certainly is
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh i think a viable option if we
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
can find if they can find a carrier
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
because that'll be that'll be the next
 
01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:39.350 align:start position:0%
because that'll be that'll be the next
thing

01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
that would need to be done so
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
it is uh 11 50.
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
