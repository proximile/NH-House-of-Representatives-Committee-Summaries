organizational structure and so while
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
you see all seven divisions listed today
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're really going to focus on the
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
division of administration which is
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
where the road tool Bureau is and the
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles and as far as

of a revenue it's kind of a summary of
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%

Division of Motor
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so if on page three we want to
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
highlight the two primary sources of
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funding for the Department
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
of Safety Highway funds and General
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
funds the highway funds totaling
 
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
funds the highway funds totaling
approximately

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
263 million are generated through a
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
variety of revenue streams these include
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
States gas tax collected through the
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
road tool Bureau as well as Motor
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicle registrations driver licenses
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle certificates of
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
title vehicle inspections and other
 
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
title vehicle inspections and other
miscellaneous

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
revenues so let's begin by discussing
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
five you'll see the total Highway funds
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
collected in fiscal year
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
263.net projection of
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
29.9 Million by 4 million for fiscal
 
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
29.9 Million by 4 million for fiscal
year

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
2025 we're projecting Highway fund
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue collections of
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
2612 million which is approximately
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
800,000 more than the planned
 
00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
800,000 more than the planned
26.4

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
26.4
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
million while Highway fund revenues have
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
seen a modest annual growth rate of
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
0.51% between 2018
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
2024 this increase has not kept pace
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
with the rising cost that these revenues
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
are intended to support These funds are
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
critical for supporting the department
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
of transportation's work on New
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roads as well as uh several
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
key functions within the department of
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
safety including the division of State
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
Police and the commissioner's
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
office this gap between revenue and
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
growth and cost increases
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
has resulted in structural deficits
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
within the highway
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue are the revenues are no
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
longer sufficient to meet the operating
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
needs for which the fund was
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
designed to address the shortfall you
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
may remember that between fiscal year 22
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
and 23 by Anum the legislature
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
transferred 50 million in general funds
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
and an additional 10 million was
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
transferred in fiscal year 2425 bym to
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that it could balanced for the
 
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.030 align:start position:0%
ensure that it could balanced for the
upcoming

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
bium now I want to turn things over to
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Hall bureau chief of Road tool
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
who will share more details about the
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
operations thank you
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
Amy the road tool operations um consist
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
primarily of collecting the motor fuel
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
tax um we call it the road toll um and
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
we also enforce compliance through our
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
field audit division within the
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
bureau the rooto law is not related to
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
the toos on the turnpike that's a common
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
misconception we get calls all the time
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
asking if they can pay off their Easy
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
Pass balance um so we're completely
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
separate um that system is operated by
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
the department of

Hampshire is at the distributor
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
distributor letter level so the product
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
comes in to terminals we have some
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
terminals here in New Hampshire um or it
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
will come in by truck from out of state
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but it must be a distributed to a
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
their filings with road toll they tell
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
us where that product goes and the
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
taxability of that product so some of
 
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.710 align:start position:0%
taxability of that product so some of
the

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
um transactions that occur that make it
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
a tax-free event are sales to other
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
licensed distributors or sales outside
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire so if they
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
export the product they get the credit
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
tool um and that's pretty much it for
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
the you know once they drop the product
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
into the retail station that is a
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
taxable event and then the road tool is
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
collected at that point based on that
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
slide says up but that should actually
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%

127.5 million in revenues which was 2.9

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:33.220 align:start position:0%

bottom of the graph there for
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
you and I guess at this point we'll
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
pause and take questions related to the
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
road tool
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
operations yes represent elberger thank
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
question um can you just uh expound a
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
little bit on the
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
IFA something I have not heard about
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes so the international fuel tax
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
agreement page six is um an additional
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
license that um carriers who haul um
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
using vehicles that weigh over 26,000
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
pounds or have three or more um axles so
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
the heavier vehicles that are putting
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
more wear and tear on the road have to
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
obtain an additional license um and we
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
administer those license so they they
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
used to be uh it used to be that they
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
would have to get permits for each
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um to travel through and
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
pay the appropriate tax to use the roads
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
in those Juris sections the
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
international fuel tax agreement has
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
made it um more Consolidated so they can
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
pick a homebased state and just file
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
their um mileage and fuel usage per
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to that home base State and
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
then that base State um disperses the
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
tax to the other jurisdictions that the
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
carrier traveled in based on a pro-rated
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
system thank you thank
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
you um I'll just guest ask a question on
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
page six also those um
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
licenses are those all yearly renewals
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
um all except for the oil discharge and
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
pollution control license that one is
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
Perpetual until they no longer need the
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
license so it's a one-time fee okay uh
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
well so they pay um monthly fees based
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
on the products that they're selling so
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
they file monthly reports and pay fees
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
based on that but there's no actual
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
licensing fee on top of that they just
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
pay into um the funds that the oil
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
discharge and Pollution Control license
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
um collects for thank you representa
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
ery yeah just to warm the oil pollution
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that goes into a dedicated fund uh does
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
it not and that's for remediation
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
correct so it doesn't affect the general
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
fund monies correct direct completely
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
separate and that's handled through
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
then you take from that if oh and an
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
eror mate takes place someplace and
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
there's a leak and you use that to to
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
mitigate yeah just so that we understand
 
00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:31.029 align:start position:0%
mitigate yeah just so that we understand
that

00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
yep representative Spar thank you Mr
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm new to the committee and I
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
I was just on if I understood you you
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
said that in 2023 the general fund gave
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
50 million to cover uh uh the costs that
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
were not that exceeded revenues and you
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
said 2024 is 10 million uh just so I
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand historically is is it usually
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh or is an objective of of the
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
department to to be self-sufficient what
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
what's what what's sort of the objective
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
expectation as far as I'm aware that was
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
the first time those transfers had
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
happened it's that the expenses have um
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
the revenue has not kept up with the
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
fund follow and when the revenues do
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
exceed the expenditures for the year
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
what happens to those excess funds do
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
they stay in the department do they go
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund how does that
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
know so if there's
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
any unexpended Appropriations that laps
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
back to the highway funds because these
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
Highway funds dollars expenditure if
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
their expenditures are exceeding the
 
00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
their expenditures are exceeding the
revenue

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
they would need to make adjustments
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
within the department to adjust for that
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
so they may decrease some of the
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
activities that they're doing or they
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
need to get more Revenue added to
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
their to go supplemental bill that but
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
so for the most part the department
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an issue when you give them
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
the budget having not enough funds for
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
that the highway fund sits over here
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
from that Highway fund several
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
departments benefit from those revenues
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
they budget their expenditures based on
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
you okay um representative Brier yeah
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
um first question I had is uh could you
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
give me an update on the DED fuel
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh program and how that's
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we just recently hired um a
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
fulltime well a part-time uh fuel
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer so that we can um
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know better address the concerns
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
with um inappropriate use of dyed fuel
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
um proper taxation of of the fuel being
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
used in vehicles on the roadway so he
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
just barely started um I
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
believe on Friday in this position so
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
we're working to get him up to speed
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
follow uh the other thing I remember is
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm assuming you're still
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
utilizing the IRS to do your died fuel
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
sampling currently yes Y and I was
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
curious of um is there any possibility
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
and that probably uh have to be a
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with uh State Police is there
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
any possibility of uh moving some of
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
that died fuel testing into the state's
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
forensic lab to uh kind of make the make
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
it a little more efficient for road to
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
back thank you for the question it's not
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
a current conversation but it's
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
certainly something we could
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
explore okay thank you one more follow
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh were you able to uh fill all your
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
free the audit
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
positions um all the ones that were
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
posted have we have no vacancies that
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
we're looking for in the AUD time that's
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
good to hear thank you yes represent BS
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman excuse me uh
 
00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so how
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
year you're asking for fuel consumption
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
or Road tool on average my my thought is
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
if it was 1,000 gallons the average
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle would use would donate to the
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
state $22 in taxes if I did the math in
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
my head correctly so our estimat did I
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
say 22 220 $220 in taxes so I'm thinking
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicles are only paying a
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
$100 sirar charge hybrids 50 maybe we
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
need to consider raising that if we need
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue I mean they're their use on the
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
roads I think the average electric
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle weighs 3,000 lbs more than than
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
a fuel powered vehicle so maybe that's
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
something we need to consider so we did
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
do estimates when the bill was um being
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
proposed for the registration fees um
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
and used you know um an average vehicle
 
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
and used you know um an average vehicle
average

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
mpg um I think it was 12,000 miles per
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
year um and it worked the the numbers
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
worked out to $112 and some change
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
annually in the road toll amount so
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's how they came up with the
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
$100 registration fee very good closer
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you you may proceed oh
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay you were yes any possibility that
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
you could get back about the
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
lab doing died field test
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
similar let's now discuss DMV revenues
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
which are a key component to the highway
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
let me see on page
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
11 on page 11 you'll see that motor
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration Revenue in 20 in
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 we collected 93.1 million
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
which was 2.9 Million above our planned
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
Target of 90.2 million looking ahead
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
we're projecting 90.4 million in revenue
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 20
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
five these figures represent the state's
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
share of registration fees which are
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
collected at the by the state and
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
deposited directly into the highway fund
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's in it's important to note that
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
while we're seeing a dip in Motor
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
Vehicle registrations year-to date this
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
could be due to a combination of factors
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
this could include economic conditions
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
demographic shifts potential policy
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
changes or the rise in alternative
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
transportation op options and increasing
 
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
transportation op options and increasing
environmental

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
conditions as as we continue to monitor
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
these Trends we'll be able to better
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
understand the impact on future Revenue
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
projections if we turn to page uh before
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
if if you don't mind I do have a
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
question here representative
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
ery you mentioned that collecting DMV
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
taxes at the local um um town clerk's
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
office and the way I understand that and
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
correct if I'm wrong that is a um a fee
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
is paid by the
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
registrant vehicle owner to the town
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
clerk for the privilege of doing it in
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
their town uh then there's a fee paid to
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
the state and then there's a fee paid so
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a three component uh tax
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
is that correct or fee fee the and the
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
part that I'm reporting on is only the
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
state share going into the highway fund
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
right so the this the numbers you're
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
giving us are monies that are going into
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
the general fund not minus any
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
percentage going to the town correct
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
yeah just wanted to it's the highway
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
fund going into the highway fund
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
yep represent
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
elme thank
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
you I believe I'm remembering correctly
 
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.870 align:start position:0%
you I believe I'm remembering correctly
um

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
we quite a long time ago now we changed
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
the registration requirement from four
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
years to five
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
years and and one of the effects of that
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
was that every fifth year there would be
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
a dip is this dip still
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
occurring the dip is still occurring and
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get to the um the impact of
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
that and when we'll start actually
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
fade oh there is um I'm sorry we we seem
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
questions there there's a I will get um
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
repres resentative Aly there's a slide
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
on that and I'll get to I'll get back to
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
your question but that is also a factor
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative elberger thank
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
question uh the little chart at the uh
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the bottom right corner on page
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
11 uh indicates registration fees and
 
00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
11 uh indicates registration fees and
I'm

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that the second line goes from 0
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
to 3,000 then 3,000 1 to, 1500 I assume
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
that's a typo oh I apologize I will
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you I think it's
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
one uh representative you set seeing
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
that we cracked a seal here I I thank
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering if you're taking
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
into account and I'm just kind of
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about this I know my vehicles
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
are getting older whether this accounts
 
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
for a lot more older vehicles being
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
registered where that fee goes down have
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
you taken a look at what that impact may
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
or may not be in relation to what you
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
predict forward you bring up a good
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
point um I just I just had someone point
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
out that may be the town tax portion
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
represent yes
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
just again break that down there's a tax
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
which is which the number she's
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
reporting here then there's a fee which
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
is paid to the town and that is a
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
sliding scale fee based upon vehicle age
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
and weight and all that stuff and then
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
there's another fee for the privilege of
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
not having to go up and bother the
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
people and conquered when you register
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
or pay state tax so one tax and two fees
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
three charges one
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill okay fromi thank you uh I've been
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
here a long
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
time and when I started we were engaged
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
in increasing or rather when we started
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
up ways and means again um we were
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
engaged in increasing the um this tax
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
and every time we did
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
this the trucking industry would come in
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
and would argue us into cutting in half
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
the increase for
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
them and after um we did that they would
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and get the other half
 
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.230 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and get the other half
taken

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
off so I wasn't I am not now and I was
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
not then sure whether we
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
were uh writing a wrong for the trucking
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
industry or whether we were just being
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
taken uh do you have any idea what the
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
relationship is now between the fees
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
which I don't think have gone up since
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
about eight years into that
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
ago no I am not aware
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank yes represent opal thank you Mr
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you director
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
Newber I'm sure we'll let you get back
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
to the rest of your presentation just
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
shortly um I I just have a quick
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
question of course that you may or may
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
not have handy um on that same page that
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
representative Elber was talking about
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
slide 11 that chart the registration
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
fees I'm wondering if you could provide
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
us information on the percentage or or
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
the gross number whichever makes more
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
sense for each of those weight
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
idea so of the registration fees what
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
percentage are in the 0 to 3,000 pounds
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
category what percentage are in the
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
3,000 to 3,000 to1 to I'm assuming
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
5,000 Etc through all the
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
categories I will follow up with the DMV
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions you may
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
continue what now you have a question
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all one one more question of
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
course what the
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
hey or straw depending upon the time of
 
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.630 align:start position:0%
hey or straw depending upon the time of
year

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this gives us any idea of
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
the total number of vehicles that are on
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
our highways On Any Given because we're
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
a tourist state is that
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
correct I do not have that
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
information and the follow the the other
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
answer other followup would be if I may
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
followup there's no way to get that
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
information unless we surveyed every
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
on page 12 and representative Aly this
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
gets to your question um motor vehicle
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
operator revenues which include driver
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
licenses have stabilized these revenues
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
have experienced cyclical dips due to
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
the transition from four to fiveyear
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
licenses but we anticipate that these
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
dips will level out by
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
2036 effective May of 202 5 is the
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
federal deadline for real ID compliance
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
which may also Drive additional activity
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
as individuals upgrade their
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
licenses on page
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
14 inspection revenues which follow a by
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
annual fee structure remains steady at
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
around 4 million in one year and 3.9 the
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
next page 15 plea by mail was added to
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
the highway Fund in fiscal year
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
20 in fiscal year 24 we collected 5.6
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
million Which is 682,000 less than the
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
plan of 6.3 million in fiscal year 25 we
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
are projecting to collect 5.8 million
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
which is a decrease of 514
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
th000 and finally on page
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
17 while general fund revenues are not a
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
major Focus they total around 8 million
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
annually these revenues have decreased
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
over time as certain functions such as
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing has transitioned to
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
other departments in oplc now um and
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
therefore the appropriation went as well
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
in summary while these revenue streams
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
are stable the modest growth we are
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
seeing is not sufficient to fully
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
address rising cost and structural
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
deficits in the highway funds factors
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
such as fuel prices economic conditions
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
and weather patterns will continue to
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
play a significant role in shaping our
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections strategic planning
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
and ongoing legislative support will be
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
critical and ensuring sustainability of
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
these funds and programs they support we
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
represent thank you on the plea by May
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh in 20 when we transferred that over
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
to uh the highway fund the next estimate
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
was a real guess because we had no idea
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
how that would actually work out and it
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
seems as though the the fees have been
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much evenly between five and six
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
each year uh on both uh both counts
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
however there seems to be a a general
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
decrease in the um
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
um overall
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
amount um received in fees and there is
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
an increase as you can tell because you
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
drove to work this morning
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
in um speeding and in individual
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
accidents uh accidents with injuries
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
while deaths have uh uh continue to
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
decline because of safer cars and the
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
newer cars I I would presume uh the
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement seems to decrease is this
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of filled positions
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
within uh the state police division or
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh can you have an idea as to why there
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't been uh an increase when there's
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
been an increase in speeding uh and
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
other violations I mean you had that
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
perfect one in Dairy with the school bus
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
violation um is there anything like that
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
you could add to that yeah you know I
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't um you know it's it's definitely
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
not a onetoone I wouldn't say that um
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
we're actively filling State Police
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
vacancies we but we do have a high
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate we're at 61 vacancies right
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
now um however we are filling um Academy
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
classes um at between 8 and 10 right now
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is which is really really good um
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a really good ratio
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
for us um um so we are recruiting more
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're having more um larger classes um
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
but as far as writing tickets it's not
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
the only thing the state police does so
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to increase the police force
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
by 10 we'd probably write more tickets
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
if we increase by one I don't know um so
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
I think that um we're going they're
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can and we we
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
have we we don't have we're not fully
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
staffed so
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
H and just for the record because PE
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
some people one or two possibly are
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
actually watching this there is no quot
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
system in the State Police or any of the
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
towns in which you know because the
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
towns do not receive any of this
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
money uh and there's no um mandatory
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
minimum or places where people have to
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh sit and and do traffic enforcement is
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
that correct to the rest of your
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
Elber thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh on slide
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
17 um there's a uh an indication here
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the purple represents plumbers and
 
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
that the purple represents plumbers and
gas

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
Fitters we haven't G
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that with that is a service that's
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
the licensing service that moved from
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
safety to um oplc that's the licensing
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
Fe so the so that is being recorded in
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue but just not from
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
safety just follow
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
so plumbers and gas Fitters fees used to
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
come okay thank
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
you represent op
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
again director um on page 12 again I
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be curious to see if you could
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
provide us with a
 
00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:10.790 align:start position:0%
provide us with a
breakdown

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
um a similar chart over time in terms of
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
the actually the aggregate numbers of
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
people who are getting operators
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
licenses the real ID licenses commercial
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know um I'd be interested I'm
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
assuming that now when most people are
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
getting their license renewed they're
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting real ID but um I'd like to I'd
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
be curious about
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you I will follow up with the
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
first representative
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
Brier yeah uh I I know you're not going
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
to have this answer right now but I was
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
just curious because I haven't looked at
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
it in a while uh my understanding is uh
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the lowest tax rate on
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
fuel in the
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh if you we looked at uh New
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
England or the Northeast uh what are the
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
neighboring states rates and uh is there
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
like how much how many cents are we
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
lower than say massachus it's Maine
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont all the neighboring states
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
because I if I recall you're still
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
taking about 830 million gallons taxable
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
right your taxable gallons is still
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
about 830 million
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
ion yeah we haven't seen fluctuation in
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
that number so he's still bringing about
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
8 8.3 million for every penny
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
right so I was just curious uh what we
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
had for wiggle run between tax rates on
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
neighboring states um I do have that
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown I don't I didn't bring it with
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
you I didn't expect you to have it I was
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there possibility to
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
get with all our neighboring states both
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
Bolton thank you Mr chair so you
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have 61 vacancies
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
right now um in your police force now we
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
we heard I guess um uh at least the town
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
of Plymouth um that there was like a 28%
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
or 26% vacancy rate is that still the
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
now I don't have the percentage that
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
seems really high yeah um so so I know
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
for in State Police we have 61 vacancies
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
today is it 51 or 61 61 yeah
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay if you drive by follow up sorry if
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
you drive by um Hazen Drive you'll see
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
um basically a lot of cars just park
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
there and I'm not certain if that
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
reflects why the um the number of
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
vacancies are still there or something
 
00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:57.870 align:start position:0%
vacancies are still there or something
or

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
some of the vehicles that you're seeing
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
are um some of the new vehicles that
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
have come in that are ready um for upfit
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
and then deployment because we have a
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
lot of older vehicles that we are um
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
transitioning and then some of the other
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you're seeing are being
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
auction representative
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
y lots of questions were raised here um
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
when the vehicle goes vehicle from
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
Highway or from State Police or
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
from um
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
Dees do we have any record of how much
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
money is made from that as an
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
offset when a vehicle goes out to
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
auction yeah it would be with the
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.230 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
yes

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that that money is
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
accounted for someplace yes yeah all
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh the follow yeah
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
follow well second question if you all
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah um regarding the license fees
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
your basic operator license costs $50 an
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
endorsement for motorcycles only I think
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
another $10 on top of that an
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
endorsement for commercial license is
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
then uh depending upon each endorsement
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
they pay a fee So when you say
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
commercial is $60 that's 50 plus plus
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
plus plus it could be 70 or $80 if he's
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
a a Class A driver with hazardous
 
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.349 align:start position:0%
a a Class A driver with hazardous
materials

00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
endorsement um each endorsement has its
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
own fee that's attached so that's not
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
exactly a a set fee not every truck
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
driver is paying $60 for his truck
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
license it depends on what he's hauling
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
um the same thing applies for real ID
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
because the real ID can apply to a
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
non-driver ID so that you get $10 for
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
the non-driver ID which is basically the
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
cost of the photograph but then there's
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
the cost of having to do the background
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
check to get the real ID which is
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
separate from the endorsement that show
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
or the uh Little Star that shows up on
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
the license is that correct I believe
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct I want to confirm with
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
DMV yeah and so this
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a good
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
generalization but it doesn't provide a
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
a precise accounting for
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
each value per uh license uh for example
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
a uh a Class B Li commercial license
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
costs less than a Class A commercial
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
license and then you have school bus
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
drivers which have to have an operator's
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
license in order to get a commercial
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
license so everybody's got to have the
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
basic license and that is duplicated in

the commercial license uh whether it's

knowing each number you're going to get
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
a you're not going to get an accurate
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
picture as to the number of drivers that
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
are on the road is that correct I'm
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to defer to the DMV and
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%

our HR folks and helps us with our

Workforce and we've really been focused
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
on Recruitment and Retention which we'll
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about later on our
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
project development division is a
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
division that um plans designs and then
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
oversees the construction of all of our
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
projects Statewide all of our
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
construction projects they also take
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
care of the right of way that the it
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's the land that the roadways our
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
roadways and transportation systems sit
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
on um some fiscal year 24
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
accomplishments include 5 seven new
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
construction contracts um overall we
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
provided oversights on 84 active
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
projects for a total value of $750
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
million we have our Turnpike system our
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system is what we call an
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise funded system all of the
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
money that's collected through the tolls
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system has to stay on
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system so we cannot take
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
funds that are collected on toll roads
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
and spend those funds on non- toll roads
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
so this graphic describes the turnpike
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
system we have three segments I95 we
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
have the Spalding Turnpike and we have
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
the central Turnpike system um or F
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
Everett Turnpike system that runs up
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
from Nashua to conquered we also want to
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
point out that our Turnpike funding has
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
been relatively flat there's there's a
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
modest 1 to 2% um increase as the years
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
go by but that is far from um covering
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
the inflation that we've seen in recent
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
years from a maintenance and operations
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
perspective we have the division of
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
operations that includes the bureaus of
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance Bridge maintenance
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
traffic Mechanical Services takes care
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
of our Fleet fuel distribution that
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
provides fuel for state agencies as well
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
as municipalities and some nonprofits
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a transportation systems
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
management and operations Bureau that um
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
takes care of what we call our
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
intelligent transportation system and
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
really helps to manage uh the traffic on
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
the roadway on a day-to-day basis um we
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
do ask snow removal on days like today
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
from our Highway Maintenance bureaus we
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
have six districts and about 87 Patrol
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
sheds around the state 87 Patrol sheds
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
always sounds like a lot but when you
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
think of about 230 plus towns in New
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's one Patrol shed for about
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
every three towns and the reason we're
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
effective with our winter maintenance is
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
because our sheds are located where they
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
need to be so we have a reasonable
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
distance to travel to treat the roads
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and restock with salt and other
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
materials a little bit uh about the
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
highway fund overview so we're always
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
careful to to say the highway fund is
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
not the Department of Transportation and
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation is not
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
the highway fund I think you heard from
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
safety before us so I think you
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand they they collect those those
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
funds um what goes into the highway fund
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
is the road toll which is uh the gas tax
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents per gallon
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
13.2% goes into the unrestricted Highway
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
fund 2.2 cents flows back to
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities through block grant Aid
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
2.6 cents goes to the betterman and 4.2
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
cents goes to sp sp
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
367 which was a Tiffy alone that the
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
department received um to advance the
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
construction of
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
i93 and the way that Tiff loan was
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
structured the department promised um
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
for the first part of that loan to put
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
those funds towards to put the the um
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
4.2 cents every year to the
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities into our state Pavements
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
and bridges we were able to do that and
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
pay interest only on the loan until
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 which is the year where
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
we're in as we go forward that the
 
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
proceeds from that 4.2 cents now needs
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
to go to pay for The Debt Service of i93
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
until that loan is is paid off so we've
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
lost about $20 million a year there that
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
we've been putting towards our state
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
roads and and bridges
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
um the highway fund is Do's primary
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
source of funding our operations and
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance on State Road so we receive
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
quite a few federal funds about
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
$230 plus million do a year on the
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
highway side more on the Aeronautics
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
Rail and and Transit side those federal
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
funds come to us um and have to be spent
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
on very specific things we cannot flex f
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
f Flex federal funds towards our
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance and and operations they H
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
all have to go towards the construction
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the care of the Federal Aid highway
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
system we do take advantage of those
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds though to help our
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
operating budget by leveraging that to
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
help pay the salaries of some of our
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
people some of our Engineers some of of
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
our finance a portion of our our finance
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau and so forth uh some of our
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
construction folks we leverage those
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds to help us um pay state
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
employees salary to reduce the burden on
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that goes towards our
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance it's also
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
important to to explain that um most
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
federal programs require a state match
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the State match for most of our
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds is between 20 and
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
10% in New Hampshire we use what we call
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll credits for that match
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have state funds or
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
money in the highway fund for that match
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
the way Turnpike toll credits work is we
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
can take credit for the investment the
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
capital and RNR investment in our
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system towards the match of our
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal aid program so for instance if
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
if we do a construction project a
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
capital project on the turnpike it costs
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
$200 million and other certain
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
thresholds are are are met we can count
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
that as our match to our federal funds
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
on other projects that that means that's
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
a a match that does not include cash so
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
we have to fully pay for the federal
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
project with federal funds but we're
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have the toll credits to
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
let us do that match the next slide
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
explains um some of the recent history
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
revenue and then we get to the slide
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
that that I believe this committee was
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
most um interested in the unrestricted
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous Revenue that the
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
department receives and the the truth is
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted Revenue that we receive
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
is very very small in comparison it's
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's 200,000 to $1.2 million per year
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
approximately over the last several
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
years these we get these funds um by the
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
sale of surplus
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
land um we get these funds by things we
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
equipment that's worn out that we bring
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
to the the white Farm old chainsaws old
 
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
things like that um we um regulate some
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
signs that are within our right of way
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's a small portion of of funds that
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
comes to us from um the signs in our
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
right of way also we have a print shop
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
that makes plans for other agencies we
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
get a little bit of funds there and also
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
from junkyard like licensing but at the
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
end of the day the unrestricted Revenue
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
we receive is very very
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
small some of the issues and challenges
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh the department is facing includes
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
inflation increased labor and material
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
cost on a lot of our our construction
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
projects um we've seen significant cost
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
increases over the last several years um
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly coming out of of covid
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see things stabilize
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
just uh a little bit but it's still
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
increasing and it's not coming back back
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
down um we our other challenges include
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce vacancies so our current
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate Department wide is about
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
24% that means one out of every four
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
positions um is vacant that's really
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
putting strain on us trying to get our
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
projects out for um construction and so
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
forth paying the bills and and hiring
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
people and keeping up with our snow
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
plowing and so forth um that also winds
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
up impacting uh productivity and forcing
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
us to prioritize our resources to our
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
critical areas and for us our critical
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
areas are all about safety so we make
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
sure that we we have what we call
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers to help us plow snow from the
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
W during the winter so we have other
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
people in the department whose primary
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
job is not to plow snow that have a CDL
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
license and we set up a a program so
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
that they can come help us plow snow for
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
the winter and we work to keep a a
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
person and every vehicle we have also
 
01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
have several state agencies that we
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate very much that have employees
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
with CDLs that come to work with us
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
during the winter during snowstorms and
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
so forth to plow snow as as
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
well um the the next chart shows some
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
information on our budgeted positions so
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
the top chart on the next page shows our
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted positions and what we want
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
folks to to understand is um for for a
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
long time and what we show here is from
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
2002 to present we have a history of
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
reducing positions so this has nothing
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
to do with vacancy rate this this top
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
chart is permanent full-time positions
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted positions and we've had a
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
steady decline in the number of
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
positions that we've had we also show a
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
a graph the line there is what we call
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles traveled which shows the
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
the mileage of vehicles travel
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the the state and that shows
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
a general increase while we've been
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
decreasing our head count and then
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
finally the the chart on the bottom of
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
that page shows our budgeted positions
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
our filled positions and also shows you
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate trend line and that
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
green line is a vacancy rate trend line
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
and what you can see is prior to 2019
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
and 2020 we we maintained a pretty
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent vacancy level but during
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
covid that vacancy level started to rise
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
and it's continued to rise and just
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
recently um is leveling out and it's
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
important to us that that doesn't
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
continue to rise Beyond where we are
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
because we we really are stretched thin
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner explains commissioner
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
Cass explains it very well we work hard
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
to get done everything we have to get
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
done but there are a lot of things
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that we would like to
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
be doing and that we think need to be
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
done that that are not getting done um
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's the overall presentation that
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
we've prepared for today and I'd be
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
thank you represent elmy thank you I
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
have two actually totally different from
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
each other on one of them is I think the
 
01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.550 align:start position:0%
each other on one of them is I think the
brine

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
brine
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
Innovation came
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
in about eight years ago something like
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
that uh we're now brining the roads in
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
Winter as a result we're getting people
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
going 75 miles an hour or more on the
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
main roads but
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is an incredible contribution not
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
only to safety but I should imagine to
 
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
only to safety but I should imagine to
your

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
budget to to be doing the brining rather
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
than plowing real snow so if I could
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take a minute to explain our
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
brining program so our brining program
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a a
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment that we will do in some
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
very limited areas of the state to the
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
roadways before the snow comes there are
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
very special traff or traffic very
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
special weather conditions that we need
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
to have to make brining um available or
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
make brining beneficial to our winter
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance activities so some there are
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
some sections of 93 from Salem to
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester some secondary roads in in
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
um that we have to brine on to meet our
 
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
environmental conditions for the
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
expansion of of 93 and we we meet all of
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
those areas we've expanded our brining
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
program to include
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
I95 um the Spalding Turnpike and i93
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
North to to conquered and the the Fe
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
Everett but we do not brine Statewide
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
there are a couple other locations
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
around the state that we we also apply
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
brine so what we do is go out before the
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
snowstorm and when the when the weather
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
conditions are right we spray the brine
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
on the road and that brine will keep the
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
snow that initially Falls from bonding
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
to the pavement and help us to plow it
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
off um without pack creating or without
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
that that b creating we still use salt
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
granular salt for for most of our roads
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
cleanup follow H uh I live on the end of
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
89 and I haven't seen any sign of salt
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
going down I have seen clean roads right
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
after every
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
snowfall so I don't quite understand
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on with that but I did have
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
a another question
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
back um when Governor Lynch came in to
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
office uh and discovered that the
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation was uh not
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
had not been applying inflation factors
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
to the 10year plan for so long that it
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
was an 18-year
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
plan on and brought in someone who fixed
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is it still fixed it it is still
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
fixed so the the last 10-year plan had a
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
3.2% inflation rate for the plan we're
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
getting ready to update the plan again
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
and we we will update that inflation
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
rate what's important for me to explain
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
though that goes along to this is we we
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
have two things that impact the the cost
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
of our construction projects one is is
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
escalation one is inflation so we can
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
apply inflation factors to projects over
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
the the next 10 years what what we can't
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
do and what inflation doesn't do is take
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
into account all of the anomalies that
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen and and cost and and we all
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
know it's a different world since since
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
covid material cost labor cost many cost
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
have our exceeded inflation and what the
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
inflation rate is even at that high 3.2%
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
level that we carried in the last
 
01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.790 align:start position:0%
level that we carried in the last
10-year

01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
plan yeah on I was attempting to figure
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
out how much it was going to cost to do
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
the internal roads inside my homeowners
 
01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:21.639 align:start position:0%
complex and there is a
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
series on the the national
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation agency website that tells
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
you that follows those costs
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
specifically yes and which made me very
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
unhappy but on you can't use that in
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
your inflationary as we do we do and
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
Danielle can tell you more about what
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
goes into our inflation calculation but
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
we use both the the National
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
Construction cost index and our own
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
construction cost index where we look
 
01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
back at historical prices but again
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
those those are based at on looking back
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
and there are often anomalies in the in
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the economy that that impact things
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
Danielle do you want to add
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
anything if you're interested in that we
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
can certainly provide you with the way
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
information representative
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this is just
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
general information you mentioned that
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
there are uh airports that receive
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
federal aid and some that don't could
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
you just explain why some do and some
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't nodding I'm sorry nodding I cannot
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
explain that in great detail some are
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
are commercial federal aid eligible
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
airports and some are smaller private
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
airports what what I can do is get you a
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
listing of both the airports that that
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
um do take federal funds and the private
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
airports that are not eligible for
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
federal funds followup followup so it
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like sort of in general terms
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
larger airports are more likely to
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
receive federal AIDS than the the really
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
little ones larger one and airports that
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
are open to the public so Lebanon for
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
instance that that Airport's open to the
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
public that that gets Federal funding
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you repr shamberg thank
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you commissioner
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
rodrig uh in what area or does the state
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
need to address the benefit system to
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
keep more
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
employes is there a deficit what you can
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
offer and what the Private Industry is
 
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.109 align:start position:0%
offer and what the Private Industry is
offering

01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
offering
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so so when we talk about attracting
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
employees the department or the
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
department the the state has a great
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
benefits program from from my my
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
perspective where we tend to fall behind
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
is in the the hourly wage and where we
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
off also fall behind a little bit today
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
we still have wonderful retirement
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
system but people starting today need to
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
stay with the stay a very long time
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
before they can benefit from that
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system um so you really have
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
to have the The Long View um from my
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
perspective the it's not a benefits
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
issue with with our Recruitment and
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
Retention it's a dollars per hour issue
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it's we all know about the housing
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
cost and and New Hampshire and so forth
 
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
and you have to be able to afford to to
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
live where you're working
 
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.950 align:start position:0%
live where you're working
represent

01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and and thank
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
you commissioner for taking my question
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm curious and I'm going
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
someplace I probably shouldn't but um uh
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of our
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
airports uh beyond the federal funding
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
that we may that the state may receive
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
and Beyond
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
say uh meals and rooms tax revenue that
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
comes in from the airports for rental
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
cars cars and whatever meals Flyers are
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
enjoying um and Beyond the economic the
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
positive economic impact of say
 
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester Airport are are there any
 
01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.210 align:start position:0%
Manchester Airport are are there any
other

01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.310 align:start position:0%
other
[Music]

01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
direct is there any other direct Revenue
 
01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.990 align:start position:0%
direct is there any other direct Revenue
coming

01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
from those airports you know
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
particularly the larger ones that or or
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
maybe all of them I I don't know they
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
come any direct Revenue that comes to
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the state either restricted or
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
unrestricted right so so from the
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
airports not that I'm uh aware of there
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
are some airplane registrations that our
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
division of Aeronautics collects a a
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
very small uh amount on so um I'll ask
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
Danielle to to correct me if I'm I'm
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
wrong but there there's not a lot of
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue that comes in and there's also
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
not much for for State resources that we
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
put towards airports the funds that we
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
have that that go towards airports that
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of are federal pass
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
through funds with without much of any
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
state match um yes that is true it's
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
mostly pass through funds for for
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
airports and and the airp the air fees
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner spoke about um and
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
those fees are used to help subsidize
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
some of the airports that don't qualify
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
for federal
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
funds and there isn't there isn't a lot
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
of that I would say a quarter million
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
250,000 followup Mr chair follow up and
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just curious about what um what
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
dot um what your involvement is with the
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
public transit on on that side is it is
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
it mostly regulatory is it I mean what
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
what is your
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
role so so similar to the airports
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pass through funding so
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
we're managing the pass through funds
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
from the feds is is the primary uh role
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
to support public transit to support
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
public transit yes thank you
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so uh you
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
had mentioned the CDL drivers that are
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
volunteering the plow I mean are they on
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
the payroll somewhere else
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
and so so yes they they are on the
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
payroll somewhere else and out of our
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance budget we pay for for
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
their overtime that they they would um
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
spend with us plowing snow there is also
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
an incentive payment that they receive
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a a winter which is what has
 
01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
allowed us to have a very robust list of
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
those volunteers people who are willing
 
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
to do that they have to be available 247
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
then come in when whenever they're
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
called but as long as they do that they
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
receive that that incentive and thanks
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
we we have a about 140 volunteers this
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
winter we call them volunteers of course
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're paid and they receive
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the incentive but 140 people who are
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
willing to help us out that way that's
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
how we ensure we have a seat in every
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
truck with 180 to 190 vacancies and
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
Highway maintainers it's great to have
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
those people we would prefer to have the
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
people who work with us year round than
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
in re the training really get to know
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
their their roads real real well and and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
so forth um but it works for us
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so uh dis did you say
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
earlier that we have drones we have a
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
drone program in development or we we we
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
do we have several drones in in the
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
department um and those are very helpful
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
for us from an emergency response
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
perspective so we can go out you you one
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
of the things we we do quite well with
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
our Workforce at the department is
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
responding in times of emergencies but
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
there's a a big need to um categorize
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
the the damage and document the damage
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's occurred so we can get FEMA
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so we can estimate
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
quantities of materials that we need and
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
so forth and the unmanned aircraft are
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
very helpful for us in doing that they
 
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
have great
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
applications um for our construction
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
projects um to help our our contractors
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
show people what what's going on on the
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
on the project as as well they also have
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
liar capability so that we can get some
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
detailed survey information from them
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and so forth and we continue to to
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
look at ways that they can help enhance
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
our operations very good thank you
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
representa Bolton
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um getting back to uh
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative opal's um question about
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh you uh expend monies
 
01:39:32.239 --> 01:39:33.030 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh you uh expend monies
for

01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
transportation and I just want to admit
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm a executive director of a
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
transportation company in Plymouth and
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's all volunteer drivers and we
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
receive uh what's called dot 5310 funds
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
that actually pays for trips and
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
reimburses are not our drivers per se
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
but we pay them the IRS uh evalu
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
evaluation for basically um to keep them
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
whole you know they're not getting any
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
revenue from it but they're they're
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
getting now 70 cents a mile which is
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually quite good but I guess my
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
question is um I'm also trying to uh
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
start an actual uh Transportation Route
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
in the town of Plymouth and um it just
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
seems so cumbersome to go through the
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
process of getting permissions and I'm
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you might stream line my
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
request to get a bus going through
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
Plymouth thank you you're welcome we we
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
will I will get your information after
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
the after the hearing representative
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative Brier yeah I just had one
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm trying to remember how
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
much uh money does Road uh the road toll
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
Bureau at safety collect with regards to
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
jet fuel and Airway
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
tolls that I I don't have that number I
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you okay follow up
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
follow up does that uh does that still
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
go directly to the Aeronautics uh
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
division like was my understanding that
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
was to help fund some of the programs
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
over there I'm not sure it's not a
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
question it's not something I've been
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
asked I I can do the research for you
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you figure it
 
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.390 align:start position:0%
thank you figure it
out

01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I I found it
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
rather interesting that you were taking
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
people from One department and applying
 
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.950 align:start position:0%
people from One department and applying
that

01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
entails it seemed to
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
me uh a large amount of
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping both on the part of the
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
driver and of the
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
agencies in order to maintain the
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
person's ability to do his primary job
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
as well as the secondary
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
job that because of the hour limitation
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
by for commercial operators even though
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
these guys are not normally engaged in
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
Interstate oper operation they're
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
engaged in operation on interstates so
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
they get the the hour restrictions which
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
are killing
 
01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.390 align:start position:0%
are killing
people

01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh or killing productivity I'll put it
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
that way not people productivity how
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
much does it cost highway to do all that
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
extra bookkeeping to make sure that you
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
don't kill off the primary job and you
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
well u i can talk about the payroll
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
implications so that there is a payroll
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
implication for that so we have the
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing there there is some overtime
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
charge to that there is some
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
coordination with administrative
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
services to make sure that those things
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
occur um it definitely is more work in
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
the in the winter time but it gets it
 
01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
gets accomplished as far as the
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
productivity of employees I can't speak
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
to that directly
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
I would ask if you have
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
some yes thank you and we agree with you
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
not an ideal
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
situation um the people who do this are
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
first willing nobody's compelled to do
 
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
it and they do get approval through
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
their their supervisory chain of command
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people's full-time job is
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily driving a a commercial
 
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle they they have other jobs some
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
of them work for the dam Bureau at Dees
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
so part of their job may be to to
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
operate a commercial vehicle but a lot
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
of them that's most of all of them
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
that's not what they're doing all day
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
every day follow
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
up uh yeah the only reason I I in a
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
previous life I did uh liability
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
investigations and fraud investigations
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and such and that came across with a
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
OTR and was doing a favor for a friend
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
and he almost got badly screwed because
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
he was over hours for because of the
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
friend and unfortunately I was with some
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
idiot hit him head on at speed so that's
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
the only reason I asked that I want to
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
make sure the state didn't have any
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
liability thank
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
you um okay yeah we're we're running
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
late let's take one more question from
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair very
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
quickly uh I want to refer to the uh
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
page you have Highway fund Revenue
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
history and this is before my time but
 
01:44:31.679 --> 01:44:33.070 align:start position:0%
history and this is before my time but
in

01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
2010 and looks like 11 there's a line in
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
there that says uh $30 red red search
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
charge of 38 and then 29 and it
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
disappears in
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
2012 what what was that yes so so there
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
has been a long-term recognition and
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
concern that the highway fund does not
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
generate a re enough Revenue to do
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
everything that the department of safety
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Transportation
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
need to to do so there have been a
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
number of what we call one-time fixes
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
that $30 registration search charge was
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
a temporary sech charge it was a
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
one-time fix if my memory serves me
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
correctly most of of that sech charge
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
went to Paving our what we call tier
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
three tier four roads our lower volume
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
roads um that were not in in very good
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
shape at at all at the time but that was
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's an example of a one-time fix that
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
was used to get us through a few years
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
for a specific purpose thank you
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for today's
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
you oh yes just one quick I just want to
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
get it on the record that in fiscal year
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 the department believes the
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous Revenue that they'll
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
collect will be
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
$200,000 each year yes it's it's very
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
diff it is very difficult to um
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
determine how much land will be sold
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
what it will be sold for ETC and so we
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
keep that at at a base of that's in line
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
with your low
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
number okay thank
 
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll now welcome up the um Health
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
sure yeah let's do
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
did you see that sent an email called
 
01:47:41.800 --> 01:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
did you see that sent an email called
that

01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
um yes welcome and if you'd introduce
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
yourselves of course uh good morning
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Mr chair my
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
name is Nathan white I'm the Chief
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and joining me
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
here today is also um I'm attorney
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
janelli and I'm general counsel for and
 
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
manager of the Department's Medicaid EST
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
good morning morning yes uh I'm Meredith
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
tus director of our division of program
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
Department okay so before you you have a
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
presentation and if you turn to page two
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
that is where we'll begin so the
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
we have a number of different sources of
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
recoveries and other Revenue
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
and I think what's important to
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand here and Janelle and Meredith
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be going into some of the
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
details and you've probably heard this
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
from uh some of the other state agencies
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
is it is very difficult to predict uh
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of recoveries that the state
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
will have because some of this is
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
dependent upon probate actions some of
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
it is dependent upon prosecutions by the
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office it is
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
dependent upon Medicade cost reports how
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
costs have been reported by various
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
organizations as well as whether IND
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that were previously in the
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program has passed and so
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of externalities that
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
control these and so what we what we can
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
see from year to year is uh significant
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuations so in in state fiscal year
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
24 which is not listed here we collected
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
approximately $3.5 million of um other
 
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue within the within recoveries
 
01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
this year um based on current
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
projections and we look at this on a
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
monthly basis uh we're looking at about
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
2.16 million however one one settlement
 
01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
or One recovery could quickly throw that
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
off because sometimes those come in the
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of several $1,000 but based on
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
current projections that is where we're
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
looking for State fiscal year 26 and 27
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that we have budgeted
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
about 3.1 million uh that's slightly
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
higher than the current budget um but
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
when we when we prepared the agency's
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
budget request back in August we we are
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
given Specific Instructions
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
and one of those instructions was to
 
01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
keep those revenues uh as uh budgeted
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
for the current bym so that that's part
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
of the reason why you're seeing 3.12
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
million there even though the projected
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
for this year is lower um so that's a
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
very high level of the overview um of
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
the uh of the different types of
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
recoveries and sort of some of the
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
challenges that we do have in in
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
projecting some of these obviously it's
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
about $3 million it's not a huge amount
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
of money when looking at the many other
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources that this committee
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
evaluates on a regular basis um and
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to start off with the
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid estate recovery just going into
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail there because
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
that typically represents the bulk of
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
our recoveries and again some years if
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have a lot of if you don't
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
have a lot of medic medicated State
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
Recovery you can see a significant drop
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
whereas other years you can you know
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
with one recovery alone could be a
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
couple hundred thousand and it could
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
change that pretty quickly so with that
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
hi good morning uh as I said before my
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
name is janeli and I run the Medicaid
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
estate recovery unit for the Department
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm also that unit's general counsel
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very small unit it's myself as
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
the only attorney and then I have four
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
staff members who support the work that
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
we do on any given year we recover about
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
approximately at any given time we have
 
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
about 2,000 open cases and that tends to
 
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
be the total number of recoveries we get
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
per year the average recovery right now
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
the 17 average average 17-year average
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
recovery is just a little over $4,000 at
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
a time recoveries can be anywhere from
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not kidding you two cents to over a
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars so it's uh we're quite
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
busy and every little bit counts so we
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
try to go after every type of recovery
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
that we are permitted to by law we have
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
actually 16 different categories of
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
recovery the two biggest are from
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
probate Estates from deceased Medicaid
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
recipients uh then we also recover from
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
certain special needs trusts and then
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
the other one is the other big one is
 
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
from leans on which we've are the
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
recovery from leans that on property
 
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:46.950 align:start position:0%
recovery from leans that on property
that's

01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
sold that we place during a recipient's
 
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
lifetime and it either sold while they
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
were alive or after we're very very
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
careful about following the law with
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
respect to leans and estate recovery we
 
01:53:02.669 --> 01:53:02.679 align:start position:0%
do not recover under a number of
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances depending on the type of
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
recovery um as you know Medicaid is a
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
welfare system and we are obligated and
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
have been since the Inception of weal
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
the Inception of Medicaid in the early
 
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:19.719 align:start position:0%
1960s to recover under certain
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances then state law has also
 
01:53:22.199 --> 01:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
circumstances then state law has also
then

01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
built around that and in fact the
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
federal law I just like to point out
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
because a lot of folks don't know it and
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
I think it's important because it speaks
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's history and tradition
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the federal estate recovery law was
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
actually based on what New Hampshire has
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
been doing since the
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
1930s so um when I first started with
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
the unit our average Total Recovery was
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
about 4.6 million and we are up to 6.7
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
million now but we're at about Max
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
Capacity at this point so just clarify
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
we don't all those dolls and yes that we
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
recover on behalf of the federal
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
government and the counties as well as
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
the state so a good chunk of what we
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
recover actually goes to the federal
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
government and another big chunk of
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
what's left after that goes to the
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
counties for long-term care services
 
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:19.639 align:start position:0%
primarily so I don't know um do you want
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
me to go into some more or uh
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
so the numbers that you see on page two
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh with with respect to Medicaid State
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
Recovery um projected for this year will
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
be about $
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar um and and as Mr
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
White indicated just a moment ago the 26
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and 27 numbers we were instructed to
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
keep those
 
01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
keep those
fixed

01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if anyone has any
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
questions or I know you're you're short
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
briefer I think we can continue thank
 
01:55:00.119 --> 01:55:02.430 align:start position:0%
briefer I think we can continue thank
you

01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:05.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:05.229 --> 01:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
right do you want me to walk in through
 
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
child support okay so starting on page
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
four child support
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
recoveries you'll see our estimated at
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
11,000 um budgeted in the next two years
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
at 15,000
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
these are court ordered recoveries of
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
medical support where Medicaid's made a
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
payment on the next slide slide five
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
cost settlements or you can walk through
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
this all on slide two as well whichever
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
you prefer Slide the individual slides
 
01:55:36.079 --> 01:55:37.350 align:start position:0%
you prefer Slide the individual slides
have

01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
descriptions underneath the numbers so
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
however you prefer to walk through
 
01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
it uh these are cost settlement
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
recoveries so this is where the Medicaid
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
Program um on the just the fee for
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
service individuals and Medicaid
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
programs let me let me make a
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
clarification that will apply to I think
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
almost all of the next few slides the
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
recoveries that we're making as an
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
agency are only for our feif for service
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
population our Managed Care
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
organizations hold the bulk of the
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population over 180,000 people
 
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that in feif for service
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
right now we have 10,000 people fewer
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
than 10,000 people on any given day so
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
we have a tiny portion of the Medicaid
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
population and these recoveries are only
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
B based on those 10,000 which is why the
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
numbers that you see are so small the
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations do their
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
recoveries on their side for their
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
population so I just want to make that
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
clarification for you so the cost
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
settlements here are for outpatient
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
claims uh based on our methodology we
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
pay an interim outpatient payment and
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
then those are audited by Myers and
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
stoffer and then we settle up with the
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
date slide six uh other recoveries
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
diabetic supply these these are
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that we get based on uh
 
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
rebates that we have established with
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
diabetic supply entities slide seven
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
other recoveries this is simply an
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
individual uh account I'll call it or
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
accounting of Prior year related
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
recoveries and that's just so that from
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
a financial perspective we have tabs on
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the current year
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
years slide eight uh the Attorney
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
General's office fr Fraud Unit this is
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid fraud control unit at
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office that
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutes fraud for us as related to
 
01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers uh you'll see that
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
our current projection for this year is
 
01:57:35.159 --> 01:57:36.069 align:start position:0%
our current projection for this year is
around

01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
$75,000 the next two years we've only
 
01:57:38.239 --> 01:57:39.470 align:start position:0%
$75,000 the next two years we've only
budgeted

01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
40,000 as Nathan mentioned early this is
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
very case specific it absolutely depends
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
on how many cases they have how much
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
each case is worth and how long it takes
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
to prosecute them
 
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh slide nine the Medicaid Program
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit projections by state
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um projection for this year
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
is at 100,000 and we're budgeted for
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
150,000 in each of the next two years
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
these are cases that don't rise to the
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
level of fraud but there's some kind of
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
overpayment that we identify uh in our
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
population and we will do our own
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
investigations and when we determine
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
that it's not fraud we will recover the
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
money ourselves so that's why this is
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
separated out from the work of the AG's
 
01:58:21.679 --> 01:58:25.390 align:start position:0%
separated out from the work of the AG's
unit

01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
slide

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
10 client recoveries so the other slides
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
were related to Medicaid providers where
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
we believe there's been an overpayment
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
slide 10 is related to where there's an
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
individual beneficiary where we think
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's been an overpayment and when the
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
recovery has been determined through
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of Court prosecution or a
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
settlement with County attorneys then we
 
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
will receive payments these are usually
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
done in the form of a payment plan um
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
current project for this year at
 
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
27,000 and uh We've budgeted 40,000 in
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
each of the next two years again I'll
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
just reiterate this is all very case
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
specific so it's really up to what
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
happens in a year how much activity
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
there is and how much uh it's valued
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
at slide
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
11 this is related to individuals in our
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
fif for service program who are on
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but also have some other form
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
of insurance they could have commercial
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
insurance they could have medic care and
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has to be the payer of Last
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
Resort so in instances where Medicaid
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
somehow paid first we would recover the
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
money that should have been paid by
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
another insurer either directly from the
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
other insurer or in the case of Medicare
 
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
we recover it from the
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
provider and those are the current
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
projections are at 35,000 um budgeted at
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
just 6,000 for the next two years as
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
you'll note there's a note here it's
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
elevated this year because we were doing
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
some back billing for from prior years
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
but that's not going to
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
continue and the last uh individual item
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
is third party liability casualty so
 
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
accident and Trauma
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
cases uh you'll see that the current
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
year is 180,000 the next two years are
 
02:00:09.199 --> 02:00:10.189 align:start position:0%
year is 180,000 the next two years are
only

02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
90,000 this is partly because and I'm
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
just looking at Tasha Blanchard my
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau administrator for program
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
Integrity to make sure I'm I'm saying
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
this correctly but this is partly
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
because we moved uh our PPL casualty
 
02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:25.639 align:start position:0%
program into the mcos a couple of years
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
ago so what's happening now is as cases
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
are settling out we will get fewer and
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
fewer recoveries on the state side that
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
there yes and the Managed Care entities
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
will be getting the recoveries for
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing the work for us and
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
they'll be keeping the recoveries for us
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
that money the state then gets on the
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
back end when we do our rate setting for
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care entities we lower the
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
amount that they're getting by the
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
amount of these recoveries so and
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're then doing the administrative
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
work of of pursuing the
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
cases that's the end of our presentation
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions thank you
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
your timing is impeccable it's 12
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
o'clock but uh we will we will see
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
whether there's any questions
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
bolt thank you Mr chair um I want to
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
make sure I heard this right you say
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
that you deal with um about 10,000 cases
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
We There are are fewer than 10,000
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
people in the Medicaid fee for service
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
program meaning they're not covered by
 
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
our Managed Care organizations followup
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
follow up uh how many were in the
 
02:01:37.149 --> 02:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
Managed Care uh situation I think we're
 
02:01:37.159 --> 02:01:37.950 align:start position:0%
Managed Care uh situation I think we're
around

02:01:37.950 --> 02:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.510 align:start position:0%
around
185

02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
185

03:08:30.750 --> 03:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh your your buttons there good
 
03:08:33.870 --> 03:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Warren Cormac I'm
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
the Assistant Attorney General at the
 
03:08:37.870 --> 03:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Justice who
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
handles the tobacco Master settlement
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
agreement the
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
MSA New Hampshire has received an MSA
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
payment each year since 1999 the year
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
after the agreement was was signed this
 
03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
agreement came as the result of a
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
settlement between the states and the
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
major cigarette companies the states
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
brought claims against the major
 
03:08:58.510 --> 03:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
cigarette companies uh many of which
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
related to the company's false claims
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of
 
03:09:04.229 --> 03:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
cigarettes as a result of the settlement
 
03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
the major cigarette producers play pay
 
03:09:08.910 --> 03:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
the states every
 
03:09:12.750 --> 03:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
year and uh other companies are also
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
other companies that manufacture
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes are also required to put
 
03:09:18.190 --> 03:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
certain funds into escrow accounts
 
03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
to receive a full payment under the MSA
 
03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
the states must diligently enforce the
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
MSA and its Associated statutes so
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
job since the Inception of the MSA
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
payment payment amounts to New Hampshire
 
03:09:33.070 --> 03:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
are regularly in the tens of millions of
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
dollars annually and that payment
 
03:09:38.910 --> 03:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
typically occurs in April and in recent
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
years it's come in the form of uh two
 
03:09:40.800 --> 03:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
years it's come in the form of uh two
separate

03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
separate
 
03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
payments the payment to calculate the
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
payment we start with a large base value
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then that value is adjusted upwards
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
and downwards several times before being
 
03:09:55.229 --> 03:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
allocated to the individual signatory
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
states though it's not the only factor a
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
major factor which helps us estimate
 
03:10:01.309 --> 03:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
this payment is the total amount of
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
cigarette sales
 
03:10:04.910 --> 03:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
Nationwide when I've previously
 
03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
testified before the Ways and Means
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
Committee I've been asked to answer the
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
following questions uh one what are the
 
03:10:12.030 --> 03:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
contributing factors that go towards the
 
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
annual MSA payment two what are my
 
03:10:16.590 --> 03:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
estimates uh for how much New Hampshire
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
will receive an MS payments for the next
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
three years and three how certain are my
 
03:10:23.070 --> 03:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
estimates and is it possible to increase
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
the certainty of those
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
estimates so first I'll start with what
 
03:10:28.269 --> 03:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
are the contributing factors that go
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
towards the annual MSA payment we start
 
03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
with a base payment that's around $9
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
billion it goes up for inflation so
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's 3% inflation every year assumed
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
if inflation is greater than 3% then it
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
goes up for that greater amount it goes
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
down for a volume adjustment and that
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
volume adjustment is the volume of
 
03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.309 align:start position:0%
volume adjustment is the volume of
sold

03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
sold
 
03:10:52.670 --> 03:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and there can be reductions
 
03:10:54.429 --> 03:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
in the in the downwards volume
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment which means the volume
 
03:10:58.830 --> 03:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
adjustment can then go up a little bit
 
03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
um but still be downwards uh due to
 
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
increased operating income for the major
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers there's also a downwards
 
03:11:10.349 --> 03:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
adjustment for the states that are not
 
03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
signatories to this agreement so that
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount that the states that
 
03:11:17.070 --> 03:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
are signatories to the agreement receive
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh there's a potentially
 
03:11:20.590 --> 03:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
downwards adjustment uh for something
 
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
called The npm Adjustment npm stands for
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturer this is
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh sales of uh cigarettes that are
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
outside of this MSA payment structure
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
MSA agreement they're not signatories to
 
03:11:37.229 --> 03:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
the MSA agreement and then after we do
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
all that we allocate New Hampshire uh
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's allocated amount and
 
03:11:42.910 --> 03:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
that percentage stays the same every
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
year um it's about uh 65% of the total
 
03:11:50.510 --> 03:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
payment and many assumptions go into
 
03:11:52.830 --> 03:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
these factors I'd be happy to discuss uh
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
those in the question period if you all
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
are interested but it's a complicated
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
formula and uh it relies on many
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
variables and uh at the end of it I can
 
03:12:05.309 --> 03:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
come up with an estimated amount but I
 
03:12:07.389 --> 03:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
always give the caution that the amounts
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
that I put in any of these memos are
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
reliant on a large number of factors uh
 
03:12:15.389 --> 03:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
most of which are incredibly difficult
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
to estimate and even if we estimate them
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly uh the cigarette manufacturers
 
03:12:23.229 --> 03:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
may decide just to withhold certain
 
03:12:24.429 --> 03:12:24.439 align:start position:0%
portions of these funds because they
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a right to do so under the MSA
 
03:12:30.429 --> 03:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
agreement so these estimates are rough
 
03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
estimates at
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
best what are my estimates uh for how
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
much New Hampshire will receive for the
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
next three years well 2025 I estimate
 
03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:41.550 align:start position:0%
next three years well 2025 I estimate
around

03:12:41.550 --> 03:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
35,000 excuse me 35 milion
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
500,000 uh 2026
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
32,500 th000 and in
 
03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
2027 30,000 excuse me 30 million um so
 
03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
those estimates they're around 35.5
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
million 32.5 million and 30 million uh
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
best and as I said before these are very
 
03:13:10.990 --> 03:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
uncertain uh a major factor here is that
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
the signatories to the agreement do have
 
03:13:14.790 --> 03:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
a right to withhold certain portions of
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that agreement of the total sum to be
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
paid uh sometimes a company will go out
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
of business or cease to be able to
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
transact with the United States and in
 
03:13:27.070 --> 03:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
those cases we won't receive the funds
 
03:13:31.229 --> 03:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
and there's also the npm adjustment um
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
which is an adjustment that could also
 
03:13:38.550 --> 03:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
reduce uh our payment by a large amount
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
but we have the state of New Hampshire
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
has settled uh that dispute for the
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
prior several years which results as in
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
receiving the majority of that pay
 
03:13:49.229 --> 03:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
payment um in the
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
year subsequent to that payment
 
03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
so I can talk more about that if you
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
have questions about that but that's
 
03:13:57.670 --> 03:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
generally how the npm adjustment works
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
is that there's a slight downwards
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the total payment we've
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
settled it which makes it a lot more
 
03:14:04.030 --> 03:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
secure and that's something that we've
 
03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
done for the last several
 
03:14:08.590 --> 03:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
years there's the risk uh that if we go
 
03:14:10.750 --> 03:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
into an arbitration um it could be
 
03:14:13.110 --> 03:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
reduced and if that were to occur we
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
could lose uh the entirety of the
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
adjustment or the entirety of the
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
payment but that has not happened to New
 
03:14:23.710 --> 03:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so very uncertain but those
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
are my estimates happy to answer any
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:14:33.750 --> 03:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and um thank
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
you sir for that um I'm I'm curious you
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think
 
03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:39.469 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think
two

03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
um situations in which a a company could
 
03:14:46.349 --> 03:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
withhold funds from the agreement one is
 
03:14:48.429 --> 03:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
they go out of business business kind of
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense the other is I think you
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
said if they're not able to do business
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the US I'm not sure what
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would be but are
 
03:15:01.150 --> 03:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
there are there other um situations in
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
which payments can be withheld yes uh
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
they a company who signat already of the
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
agreement can choose to uh redirect a
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
certain portion of the funds uh away
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
from the payment to a disputed payments
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
account or uh even withhold it from the
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
disputed payments account there are
 
03:15:21.150 --> 03:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
certain incentives not to do that
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
depending on how likely they think
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be successful in an
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
arbitration based on this withholding
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
but they can do it for any number of
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
reasons it it's certainly not limited to
 
03:15:30.990 --> 03:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy or being unable to transact
 
03:15:33.189 --> 03:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the United States typically they
 
03:15:34.990 --> 03:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
would State a basis for the withholding
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the funds under the uh MSA contract
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
settlement uh or uh and then that would
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
be taken into consideration uh by a
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
future body potentially but they can
 
03:15:48.229 --> 03:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
with withhold excuse me sorry about that
 
03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh they could withhold uh based on a
 
03:15:53.870 --> 03:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
dispute that they have they just have to
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
claim it and follow up Mr chair follow
 
03:16:01.469 --> 03:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
um uh the other uh the other area that
 
03:16:04.990 --> 03:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned was the the potential in
 
03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
going to arbitration for a a bad
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
result um does the Hampshire control its
 
03:16:13.630 --> 03:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
own fate or are we dependent on all of
 
03:16:15.150 --> 03:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
route New Hampshire and several other
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
states uh many other states have settled
 
03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh much of the arbitration issue uh that
 
03:16:35.389 --> 03:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
is a continuing settlement and this is
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
called the um npm adjustment settlement
 
03:16:37.399 --> 03:16:38.990 align:start position:0%
called the um npm adjustment settlement
agreement

03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
and we're settled through this upcoming
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
payment year so the April 2025th payment
 
03:16:47.429 --> 03:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
um and New Hampshire successfully
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
settled for this npm adjustment uh for
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
several years um but in order for New
 
03:17:00.269 --> 03:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be settled through 2026
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
there would have to be an additional
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
03:17:14.910 --> 03:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
the amounts that you're estimating and I
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate that they are estimates
 
03:17:23.229 --> 03:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
and that you're not committing in
 
03:17:26.590 --> 03:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
anything um they they drop by about two
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
and a half million from year to year is
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
that something that you're seeing as an
 
03:17:35.189 --> 03:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing trend is it specifically related
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
to these years but can you talk some
 
03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
more about that please I can talk about
 
03:17:43.189 --> 03:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
that so um I think that the the first of
 
03:17:45.070 --> 03:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
all yes it's a trend that we're seeing
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
and this is a pretty consistent trend
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
um through much of recent history with
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
the exception of kind of I can
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
colloquial refer to as the co years uh
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
there was a bit of a boom in cigarette
 
03:17:59.189 --> 03:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
sales during that period or at less at
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
least less of a decline and as I said
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
kind of at the start much of the
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment much of the ways that that
 
03:18:09.630 --> 03:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
that original base payment is adjusted
 
03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh is dependent on the volume of
 
03:18:15.229 --> 03:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
cigarette sales Nationwide and there are
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
consistent declines in that in those
 
03:18:19.349 --> 03:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
volumes year-over-year and that's
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
largely what's accountable to the
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
you anybody uh represent elme thank
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any data on what
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
percentage of the cigarette Market in
 
03:18:42.750 --> 03:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
the United States is controlled by the
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
groups that are in the settlement as
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
versus out
 
03:18:49.189 --> 03:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and I did not
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
today I will say that the um npm Market
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it has
 
03:19:04.110 --> 03:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
increased but to get the exact um
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
numbers on that I would have to I would
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
have to go back to my notes could you
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
give it to us uh later I could provide
 
03:19:19.389 --> 03:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:19.399 --> 03:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
else seeing
 
03:19:32.670 --> 03:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
you so that was uh yes that was short
 
03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
and sweet um so we have about 12 minutes
 
03:19:45.630 --> 03:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.640 --> 03:20:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
presentation

03:20:15.630 --> 03:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.550 --> 03:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
did not leave um the calendar advertised
 
03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
this as
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%

e

03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:15.439 --> 03:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.439 --> 03:24:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%

chairman members of the

committee so we'll start out our deck on
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
page two you see the 17 control
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the United States and
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see the there's some dots in
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
some of the states which are control uh
 
03:25:49.710 --> 03:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
counties which are in those states of
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
Alaska Maryland Minnesota and South
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
Dakota on page three you'll look at the
 
03:25:59.110 --> 03:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
three tier system been in place since
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh manufacturing wholesale
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
broker and
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
retail on page
 
03:26:09.389 --> 03:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
four the value of the three tier
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
system the real value of the three- tier
 
03:26:14.429 --> 03:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
system in the United States is product
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
tracking uh something you don't hear
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
about much in the United States and
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
particularly in the control
 
03:26:24.670 --> 03:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions is uh T tainted alcohol or
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
methanol contained alcohol but worldwide
 
03:26:32.550 --> 03:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
in 2024 1,200 people were affected by uh
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
tainted or counterfeit products and 400
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
people died and in The Last 5 Years
 
03:26:41.189 --> 03:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
about 1,200 people have been affected
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
and 4500 people have died
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
worldwide so one of the most most
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
important things of the control system
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
is just that we track the product we we
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
treat the product with respect and we
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
put it in the locations those Outlet
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
locations are controlled
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
locations on page five you'll see the
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
competition our main competitor is Total
 
03:27:08.189 --> 03:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
Wine in Massachusetts the history since
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
2011 when governor Patrick increased the
 
03:27:13.550 --> 03:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
number of liquor store licenses that
 
03:27:16.269 --> 03:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
could be owned in Massachusetts
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
there was three licenses for years and
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
then he lifted the cap from five to
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
seven 7 to nine and now it's up to 12 so
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
Total Wine
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
277 stores in 29 states with 11,000
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
employees $6 billion doll in revenue and
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
last year they surpassed Costco as the
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
top wine retailer in the country since
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
then they've opened 12 stores in New
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
England four in Connecticut and in
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts direct competition to The
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission in large scale
 
03:27:53.110 --> 03:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
something that the Liquor Commission
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
hadn't experienced prior to that because
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the three license cap in
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so on page six you'll see
 
03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
some national and Global factors
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
impacting beverage alcohol
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
sales the biggest thing is uh we've had
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
an increase in alcohol sales in the
 
03:28:14.670 --> 03:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
United States for the last 30 years
 
03:28:18.790 --> 03:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
until 2023 three when across the board
 
03:28:22.469 --> 03:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh we experienced a 2% decline
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh that revenue is from sip
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
source and in 23 24 and 25 they're
 
03:28:30.429 --> 03:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
expecting a
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
5.9% decline in alcohol sales across the
 
03:28:34.239 --> 03:28:35.269 align:start position:0%
5.9% decline in alcohol sales across the
United

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
United
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
States these are National and Global
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
Trends there is some bright spots but
 
03:28:43.710 --> 03:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
there the the the areas where the growth
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
is is so small uh that it's really not
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
affecting sales
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
nationally so on page seven you'll see
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
some of the factors impacting beverage
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales as I've said Dry January
 
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
sober October two big things second
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
bullet is uh for the first time more
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
Americans are using marijuana on a daily
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
basis than alcohol last year it was 33%
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the people in the United States over
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
21 this year it's up to
 
03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
44% so anti-alcohol organizations have
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
formed Neo prohibitionists as they're
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
calling them and in 2023 the World
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
Health Organization put out a statement
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
that no level of alcohol consumption is
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
is safe uh as far as the terrorists are
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
concerned there's some positive and some
 
03:29:40.429 --> 03:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
negatives obviously we feel that you
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
know some of the California wines and
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
products that are made in the South will
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
benefit it and there's a possibility
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
that uh some of the products that come
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
from overseas will uh it'll be a
 
03:29:56.110 --> 03:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
deterrent and again those are National
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
and Global
 
03:30:01.790 --> 03:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
Trends on page eight the impact of
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh you really can't have a
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
candid dialogue about alcohol without
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
bringing cannabis into play and the
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is not for or against
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis but we have to put these uh we
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
have to put these bullet points out just
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
so everyone understands what's happening
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
nationally in the United States as well
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
as here in New England you can see in
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they have 355 licensed
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
retailers uh they're going to do one
 
03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
they did
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
1.64 billion in n in
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
24 and uh the excise tax or the tax that
 
03:30:41.950 --> 03:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
they re recognized from that was 272
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
million you can see Main's licenses 218
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
217 million in sales up 36% from 22 and
 
03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
they generated about 21 million do in
 
03:30:58.590 --> 03:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
tax revenue and in Vermont second year
 
03:31:01.950 --> 03:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
in 130 million and they've actually had
 
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
to pause taking
 
03:31:08.910 --> 03:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
applications uh for lenses because of
 
03:31:12.429 --> 03:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the the rapid growth so these are
 
03:31:14.349 --> 03:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
the retailers and this is the revenue

Endeavor but many benefits will uh will
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
be seen and are already seen and

efficiencies especially in the years to

come as we get through uh the nuts and

bolts of that system we had just
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
launched it in April of last year so

which is and also includes accessories

licensing fees and uh direct shipping
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%

that other
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
revenue on page 21 this is the net
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine sales to profit we
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to show that gross profit is
 
03:38:02.590 --> 03:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
consistent over the last 10 years at 28
 
03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:03.870 align:start position:0%
consistent over the last 10 years at 28
and

03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
29% and on the bottom chart you'll see
 
03:38:10.189 --> 03:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
that net profit from 15 to 23 was
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
between 19 and
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
22% and there is a decline in FY 24 it's
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
at 177% and this is due to the 10% pay
 
03:38:22.750 --> 03:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
raise and rate change which equated for
 
03:38:26.349 --> 03:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
about 9.5 million um between the
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
full-time salaries and benefits increase
 
03:38:31.189 --> 03:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then the rate changes for our
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
part-timers in our stores to try and
 
03:38:34.990 --> 03:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
increase the rates to be more
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
competitive with the um other markets
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then the expenses associated with
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
our new software system uh it's about an
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
increase of about $5 million and then
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
you can see that total net profit from
 
03:38:53.189 --> 03:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%

our business Spirits is 49% and wine is
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
22 and then the breakdown for the other
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
categories with on Prem being 12.4% and
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
off- premise 15.6% and the accessories
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
are a half a
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
percent approximately 50% of uh sales
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
and our Outlets are from out of state
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
25% from Massachusetts 10% from Maine 8%
 
03:39:36.910 --> 03:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
from Vermont and 2% from Canada and five
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
from other states and then the pie
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
charts are broken down by FY 24 Spirit
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
sales by type you'll see that uh the
 
03:39:50.910 --> 03:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
spirit sales retail is 378 million or
 
03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
84% and then the wine sales is 169
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
54% on page
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
23 this you'll see uh the peak in
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
revenue on the first chart uh during
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
covid and then the decline that has
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
followed in the years after and as
 
03:40:14.910 --> 03:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the in the 24 net profit has
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
decreased because of those expense items
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
we do have two rsas that govern our
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
transfers prior to the transfer to the
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
general fund the first one is RSA
 
03:40:30.189 --> 03:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
176 uh 15 and that's the alcohol abuse
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
and prevention and treatment fund that's
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
5% of our prior year gross profit and
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
this transfer started in
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
fy16 at 1.7% and today it's uh 5% and
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
then there's RSA 126a a colon 3 this is
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage healthc Care
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
Program this um number is determined by
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
HHS for projected or to provide
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient non-federal funding with um
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
the ability for them to ask for
 
03:41:03.870 --> 03:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
additional funding if they don't have um
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
that off
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
Match and then you have beer tax um
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
which has been consistent around 13
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
million but has also declined slightly
 
03:41:18.670 --> 03:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
so on page 24 this is a summarized
 
03:41:24.830 --> 03:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
income statement um that shows the FY 24
 
03:41:28.269 --> 03:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
actual and our 25 26 and 27
 
03:41:30.670 --> 03:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
projections so you start with gross
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
profit from sales um plus the other
 
03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue minus the expenses to come to
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
the net revenue on row four which is in
 
03:41:41.309 --> 03:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
the green and you'll see it's been
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent um FY 26 and 27 are
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
project jeed to be 126.2 million and
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
then in the blue you have the transfers
 
03:41:50.359 --> 03:41:51.189 align:start position:0%
then in the blue you have the transfers
to

03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
HHS and then that brings you to the
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
total revenue transfer to the general
 
03:42:00.429 --> 03:42:00.439 align:start position:0%
fund which was in FY 24 109.2 million
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
and we're projecting in uh 26 and 27 a
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
little over 102 almost 103 million in 26
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
and 102.3 in
 
03:42:14.590 --> 03:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
27 um and then you have the beer tax
 
03:42:17.229 --> 03:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
which is 12.5 and then we're projecting
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
13 million in 26 and 27 to the total
 
03:42:23.550 --> 03:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund and we did
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
provide the transfer language for those
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
two transfers so that you have the full
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
language of that
 
03:42:33.389 --> 03:42:33.399 align:start position:0%
Authority and then on page 25 is just a
 
03:42:35.469 --> 03:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
graph of the transfers for the liquor
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the beer that you can see the
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
breakdown um we also included a pie
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
chart which is the annual breakout of
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
liquor Revenue transfers so you'll see
 
03:42:47.790 --> 03:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
that 81% of our revenue is transferred
 
03:42:50.349 --> 03:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
to the general fund 10% is to the
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
granted advantage and 9% is to the
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol Abuse Prevention and treatment
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
fund and we would oh and then we have
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
our charitable contributions our Awards
 
03:43:02.189 --> 03:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
and our
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
accolades and we'll be happy to answer
 
03:43:04.479 --> 03:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
accolades and we'll be happy to answer
any

03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question here
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Mika do you foresee
 
03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
any concern that this commission I mean
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
the ways and means should have about
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue with the present tariff
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
on well at this point I I think there's
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk back and forth and
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
I know noticed that this afternoon that
 
03:43:41.550 --> 03:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
the president uh and Mexico came to an
 
03:43:44.189 --> 03:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
agreement to hold them off uh for at
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
least a period of time time uh we think
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
that eventually if you know if they're
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
in place and uh we don't do a there's
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
not a lot of alcohol that comes through
 
03:43:57.950 --> 03:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
Canada there is some products that do
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
come through Mexico but there is it's a
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
given inake because there's a there's a
 
03:44:06.149 --> 03:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
glut of wine worldwide there's a glut of
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
wine in California there's a glut of
 
03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
wine in in Europe there's a glut of wine
 
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
in South America in fact in many areas
 
03:44:15.469 --> 03:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
they're they're ripping up he and
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
hectars of grapes to plant other crops
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
and we have Vats of of wine in in
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
California just waiting to be bottled
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of production of brown
 
03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
spirits in the United States uh in the
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
southern states Alabama Kentucky
 
03:44:33.670 --> 03:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
Tennessee in particular and you have the
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
largest uh vodka producer in the United
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
States in Tios in Texas so even if there
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
is there may be some adjustments in
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
where people are buying their products
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
and and what uh you know if for instance
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
if badier or Grey Goose goes goes
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
Skyhigh then people can buy products
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
that are made in the United States and
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
we do have a few products uh here right
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that are made and
 
03:44:59.750 --> 03:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
produced here that are very good
 
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
products as well so I just think it will
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
be a tradeoff thank you thank you
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
representative op thank you Mr chairman
 
03:45:10.710 --> 03:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
and um chairman Mica I I
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
know and I don't know how far back this
 
03:45:16.189 --> 03:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
goes but there was a trend at one point
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
away from hard liquor into wine um and
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
it and you mentioned in your
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
presentation there's now it it would
 
03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
appear maybe a trend back the other way
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
particularly for the sort of the
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
prepared um I don't know what I forget
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
what you called it but you know sort of
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
the vodka and orange juice in a can or
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
you know some of these um and I'm just
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
curious about those Trends and I am
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
assuming that the margin on wine is not
 
03:45:48.670 --> 03:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
on um distilled Spirits I'm I'm not sure
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
what it would be on on the the prepared
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
drinks well the the rtds are ready to
 
03:46:00.510 --> 03:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
drinks are what you're speaking about is
 
03:46:03.070 --> 03:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
the is the is it's a growing segment of
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
the market we carry some products in our
 
03:46:07.630 --> 03:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
stores a lot of those products are
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
malt-based beverages not necessarily uh
 
03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh Spirits based so they go through the
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
beer and wine Hol salers in fact
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
anything under 6% goes through the beer
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
and wine wholesalers and then between
 
03:46:23.149 --> 03:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
six and eight we can dual those products
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
anything over eight goes to the Liquor
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
Commission but what we're seeing the the
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
real Trends are is as the Baby Boomers
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
age out of the market we're seeing a
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
decline in covering so the folks for
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
years that bought in bulk and and put it
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
away bought bought the case sales that's
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
why we're adjusting what we do is for as
 
03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
sales are concerned uh that's a big
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest pieces we've
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
consistently ran about 7030 spirits to
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
Wine over the years the markup on wine
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
is does tend to be a little bit higher
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
than it does on spirits but because of
 
03:47:06.910 --> 03:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
the differentiation in the percentage
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's di Minimus because
 
03:47:13.870 --> 03:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the the overall vast amount of
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
spirits that we do
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the biggest piece of the biggest
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
three things that we're seeing is the
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
Health crisis because now everybody's on
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
a health kick and that's that's fine you
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
know we we understand that but between
 
03:47:31.070 --> 03:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
dry January sober October and the serg
 
03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
and general coming out and telling
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of what amount of alcohol you
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
drink it could cause cancer that's a
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
huge scare for people secondly the Baby
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
Boomers aging out of the market and
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
third cannabis those are all three
 
03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
things that we have to
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
consider good I follow up follow up um
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
just a one quick followup and you
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned cannabis and and this may be
 
03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
sort of out outside the scope of this
 
03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
this particular committee but I I did
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
hear um driving in this morning a story
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
on NPR about and you had mentioned one
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
of the one of the benefits of State
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
control is the ability to track um the
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
quality uh and make sure that you know I
 
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
guess that was in a more significant
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
issue as we came out of prohibition um
 
03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
but obviously Still Remains an issue
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
today and I'm wondering they they
 
03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
brought up the issue of doing the being
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
able to do the same thing for cannabis
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I mean I'm wondering if you
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on that well I I have
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
to start by saying that the Liquor
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
Commission isn't for or against cannabis
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
but any any cannabis that's sold in the
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
States now until some type of
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
deregulation is done has to be grown in
 
03:48:52.149 --> 03:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
that state so there the control is there
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
so anything that's grown in Maine
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Vermont is what's sold
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
in that state you can't cross B any of
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
it at this point there's a seed to sale
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
tracking system a seed toale tracking
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
system so that you can track it from
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
seed to
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
sale those seeds are given a skew number
 
03:49:12.990 --> 03:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
when they're planted and that that skew
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
number follows that product all the way
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
to the end product whether it's used in
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
an edible uh or whether it's used in
 
03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:22.670 align:start position:0%
an edible uh or whether it's used in
flower

03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
flower
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
form thank you representative Malloy
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:49:29.469 --> 03:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question about a year ago I
 
03:49:29.479 --> 03:49:31.189 align:start position:0%
taking my question about a year ago I
was

03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh was invited to a
 
03:49:39.550 --> 03:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh an a whiskey uh promotion by the
 
03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
distillers in Ireland a group of
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
distillers and uh it was a year ago or
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
so and I'm just curious about these
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
things do they work do they do they help
 
03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
these uh companies expand their product
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
expand their shelf uh in the state are
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
they effective at promoting their
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
products to marketing question really
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
sure we've just done and are continuing
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
to do we started about a year ago with
 
03:50:11.149 --> 03:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
Bor beia the Irish trade Council uh we
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
sent some folks over there to do a buy
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
some buying of barel
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
so we have uh exclusive products in the
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
United States here in New Hampshire and
 
03:50:22.830 --> 03:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to work with bbia and
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
the Irish trade Council we've done the
 
03:50:27.870 --> 03:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
same with Mexico we've obviously done
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
the same with California in many buying
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
trips uh over the years uh with France
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
with Italy uh there's a huge benefit in
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
these things because what it does it
 
03:50:42.990 --> 03:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
gives you exclusive products and it
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
builds those relationships with with
 
03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:46.510 align:start position:0%
builds those relationships with with
those

03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
uh folks in the wine business the
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
venters Andor the distillers and it
 
03:50:54.429 --> 03:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
gives you access to those products that
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
no one else can have we have many many
 
03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
many dozens a year of exclusive Barrel
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
Buys in this state because of those
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
programs that have been done so I find
 
03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
them to be very helpful and its
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
uniqueness consumers are all
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
about one-upsmanship if you can get
 
03:51:16.830 --> 03:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
something that no one else has and you
 
03:51:18.990 --> 03:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
can make it available at your home and
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
someone else doesn't have it that's a
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
big piece of of that
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
world thank you representative elme
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um I know you've been having
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
to try to understand the Cannabis market
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
for quite some time now do you have
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
access to any studies that show
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
whether increasing the use of cannabis
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of liquor and how
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
much effect it would be I have I have
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
hundreds of articles that I'd be happy
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
you it's interesting in that regard I
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
I've been you know you said one of the
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
reasons is um all this the negative
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
about alcohol and you know dry januaries
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
and dry Octobers at some point and I
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're seeing it
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
yet I mean there's not going to be a
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
surprise when people find out oh
 
03:52:17.790 --> 03:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis isn't good for you either so
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
when those markets start when that have
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
you seen any of that negativity starting
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
yet because once it does that could you
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
know mitigate this decline well I have
 
03:52:29.349 --> 03:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
to give credit to uh the folks that are
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the Cannabis production world because
 
03:52:35.710 --> 03:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
only uh 65% of the people who use
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis are using Edibles only 30 30
 
03:52:43.630 --> 03:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
35% are smoking flour so in order they
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
took that car cinogen piece of it right
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
out by creating the Edibles to be used
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
and people are that's what really people
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
are buying and you have the Millennials
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
who buy into cannabis in a big way um
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't really buy a lot of alcohol they
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
buy better than the Baby Boomers but
 
03:53:07.469 --> 03:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
they don't buy as much and the Baby
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
Boomers are also now the folks that
 
03:53:13.630 --> 03:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
weren't able to use cannabis for years
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
because it was a Al and they could get
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
arrested and they didn't want that sort
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
of a black mark on their history and now
 
03:53:24.030 --> 03:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're using cannabis because of the
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
Edibles and not having to smoke it so
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's a there's a lot
 
03:53:31.870 --> 03:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
going on in that
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
World um representative Spar uh thank
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair the on the page uh 21 the
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
graph there I just uh I was just trying
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
to understand clarify with may I
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
understand the gross uh sales of let's
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
say in fiscal year 24 7389 million and
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
the 28% profit is after the expenses and
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
running the
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
operation uh what is then the net what's
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
the net one down here so the gross
 
03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
profit is after cost of goods of the
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the product the net is after the
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
expenses operating
 
03:54:09.910 --> 03:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
overhead oh okay so the the net one is
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
both the cost of the goods and the and
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
the net okay and the expenses of
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
operating yes and just a
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
followup follow up yeah the there's 68
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
retail stores roughly or 65 65 65 and do
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
you each one of them have has like a
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
separate p&amp;l and you you you assess
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
whether it makes sense to you know
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
continue in one area or not depending on
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
the pnls yes okay yes that's where we've
 
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
done a lot of our um store changes in
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
con consolidations was based off of the
 
03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
profit and loss of those locations okay

Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
question so are we promoting our liquor
 
03:54:53.189 --> 03:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
sales across state lines via billboard
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe at the same time uh
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
downplaying cannabis you know
 
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia psychosis whatever
 
03:55:04.149 --> 03:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
or well we certainly are are advertising
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
our our liquor stores prostate line not
 
03:55:09.070 --> 03:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
only do we advertise print advertised
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
still uh in the globe but Billboards
 
03:55:15.389 --> 03:55:15.399 align:start position:0%
across uh Maine and in
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh and as well as social
 
03:55:20.830 --> 03:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
media is the biggest platform that we
 
03:55:25.149 --> 03:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
use as well as radio so and as far as
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
downplaying cannabis not not not an area
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we're we're touching followup
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
follow up so when the weather gets
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
warmer we'd like to see a big uh display
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
of liquor and alcohol out here on the
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
front lawn you know big sample parties
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
we can hold that thank you
 
03:55:46.830 --> 03:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
I mean to follow up on that are there
 
03:55:50.670 --> 03:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
are there legal issues with you um
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
comparing I I suppose then that becomes
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
problematic because then you're starting
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
to say well liquor is better than
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and so that that probably
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
brings you into a
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
whole difficult situation quagmire
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%

03:56:35.149 --> 03:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
that stuff is and my next question on
 
03:56:35.159 --> 03:56:36.750 align:start position:0%
that stuff is and my next question on
page

03:56:36.750 --> 03:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
13 uh you talk about curbside pickup I
 
03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
used to run drunk driving
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
programs and uh so I'm wondering what
 
03:56:49.870 --> 03:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
kind of checking is being done with a
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup both from a perspective
 
03:56:55.469 --> 03:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
of potentially drinking and driving and
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
also from a perspective of making sure
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the person who is picking up the
 
03:57:04.349 --> 03:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol isn't my 16-year-old grandson
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
for example who shouldn't
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
be receiving alcohol at all so i' I'd
 
03:57:11.309 --> 03:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
like to hear about that please sure the
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
same system that we use in the store is
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
used curbside
 
03:57:17.710 --> 03:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
