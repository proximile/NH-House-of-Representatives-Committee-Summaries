as it is a little after 10 o'clock I'd
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
like to open the subcommittee work
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
113 relative to physical fitness
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
performance requirements for law
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement offices at this time please
 
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone for coming today to
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
speak about this bill I was a little
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
afraid when I woke up this morning and
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
tell him and I start about three inches
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
of snow on the ground I wanted to sleep
 
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
in a little bit and I was hustling to
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
get here so what I'd like to do now is
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very informal uh we're
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to have everyone just come up here
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
and speak casually uh members of the
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee want to to talk about it
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly and I know that representative
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
Muse has a couple things that he like to
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
present I'd like to call the uh sponsor
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record my
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Abbott and
 
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm a representative of Cheshire six
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
which includes the towns of Chesterfield
 
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale and Westmoreland
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
my whole
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
reason for sponsoring
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
this uh
bill

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
is because the difficulty the
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
communities like those that I represent
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
have difficulty in recruiting and
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
retaining police officers
 
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.570 align:start position:0%
retaining police officers
because

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
for some of them
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
and that this physical fitness
 
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.290 align:start position:0%
and that this physical fitness
um

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:54.500 align:start position:0%
can be a real challenge for people
 
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:57.860 align:start position:0%
especially as they age such as myself
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
not that I would be interested in being
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
a police officer or but I am interested
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
in retaining police officers and those
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
police officers who like to live in a
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
and as I said I think when my testimony
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill that even though it might
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
be as physically grueling
 
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.089 align:start position:0%
be as physically grueling
for

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
a firefighter
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
to perform his duties it's
 
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:41.899 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
requirement for periodic physical
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
fitness test for
 
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
environment and I think in a small
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
community like those that I represent
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
who rely on a volunteer fire department
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
this would be a disastrous
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
and I think that the same requirement
 
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
for the safety
 
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.690 align:start position:0%
for the safety
element

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:13.700 align:start position:0%
element
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
for people to feel safe
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
and being protected in the communities
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
which they serve
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes uh just in
 
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820 align:start position:0%
my locale
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
than police officers will go
 
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.310 align:start position:0%
than police officers will go
to

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
surrounding cities such as Keene
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
or Greenfield Massachusetts or
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro Vermont
 
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:48.980 align:start position:0%
where they're going to be much
 
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.060 align:start position:0%
compensated much better than a community
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
the communities that I represent
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
kind of could afford to pay
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
that's really the old gist of why I
 
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
that's really the old gist of why I
sponsored

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
sponsored
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the
 
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.050 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the
representative

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
I know I was the first uh Academy class
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
that went through with the physical
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
fitness requirement uh
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
I do agree that there's a lot of
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
retention issues and I know what there
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
was back in 2001 when I was hired and
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's even gotten worse so I do agree
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
that that could be the issue here that
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
officers are going where they're going
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
to get compensated and not have to worry
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
about a physical fitness exam my only
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
problem is if we completely get rid of
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
it at that
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
the public might look negatively upon
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
that that we've had this law for 20
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
something years and why do we just get
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
rid of it I know that representative
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
Muse has a proposal uh I believe
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative you did you have a chance
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
to read that over yes yes I did okay uh
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
at this time representative Muse would
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
you like to discuss that and see if
 
00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:57.170 align:start position:0%
you like to discuss that and see if
you're

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
amenable to this
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
what what uh what my proposal uh that's
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
not an amendment uh would do or not an
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment yet um would actually do is
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
instead of repealing
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
um uh sections uh nine and ten as your
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill would do what it would do is it
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
would leave them in place
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
but what it would do is it would provide
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
it would provide more a lot more
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the process so what it
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
would do is it would actually give
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
officers an additional option of
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating uh evidence of annual
 
00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:34.820 align:start position:0%
participation in a wellness program
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
administered by either the Hiring Agency
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
or by the council
 
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.370 align:start position:0%
or by the council
so

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
um instead of the instead of passing the
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
fitness requirement being mandatory
 
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:48.980 align:start position:0%
there would be an alternative
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
where an officer could participate in a
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
wellness program each year
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
and taking a look at the information
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's on the U.S Department of Justice
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
website one of the things that um that
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
they've done is just a great job of
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
organizing uh uh and and really giving
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
the public access to uh an incredible
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
amount of useful information about how
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
various departments and agencies across
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
the country have designed these programs
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things having
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
done Wellness communication for large
 
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:26.540 align:start position:0%
corporations I know that that's a very
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
individualized thing uh you know and and
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
I think uh it's very important that that
 
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.220 align:start position:0%
people who understand
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
the issues are developing uh you know
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
developing a program
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important that um the
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislature kind of keep its hands off
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of micromanaging exactly what
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
the program what would be required as
 
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.260 align:start position:0%
part of the program
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and leave it up to the agencies leave it
 
00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:55.579 align:start position:0%
up to the police
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
standard standards and training Council
 
00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
to actually develop a program that could
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
be more focused not only on issues like
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
physical wellness but also mental
 
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.930 align:start position:0%
physical wellness but also mental
well-being

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:07.940 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
I know that there there is an officer
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
suicide issue that we have we've had in
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and we also have in
 
00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:18.139 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
PTSD can also be be a big issue so the
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
idea would be to provide more
 
00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:28.339 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the process
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and really give more flexibility to
 
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.949 align:start position:0%
and and really give more flexibility to
officers

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of how they want to what they
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
think they need to do to kind of keep
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
their own Wellness up to speed the the
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
one thing I would say is is section 10
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
um there there could be a case where
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
because most Wellness programs are
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
voluntary and and one thing I can tell
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
you about my own experience is that
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
mandatory Wellness programs aren't a
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
great idea it's best to have voluntary
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
participation but you may have officers
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
who not only fail the test but who don't
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh who who also for one reason or
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
another don't elect to participate in
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
the wellness program
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
um and if an officer like that fails the
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
test they would be the only ones that
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
would actually be that that uh
 
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.569 align:start position:0%
would actually be that that uh
potential

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:22.579 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
suspension could apply to
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um it's it's literally an officer who
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to do anything uh in in
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
this area but what it what it would do
 
00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459 align:start position:0%
is for an officer that had
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
um let's say a physical issue recovering
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
from surgery there would be options uh
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
for them to complete the requirement and
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
stay in the good graces of their
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
department and the council that don't
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
involve having to run a 1.5 mile race at
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
the age of 59 or however old they are
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
um so that that's my idea
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
provide more flexibility in the process
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
and allow uh allow the the council and
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
individual departments if they want to
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative yukida comment
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes I think that
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
a very good idea and I just my biggest
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out representative is
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
this this qualification uh criteria of
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
how having to run a mile and a half
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
um to me it just doesn't seem to be
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable I've I someone might make the
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
point well in order to run a mile and a
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
half in Under 12 minutes or whatever the
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
time is what a person would have to be
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
in good physical shape but I don't think
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
that is a reasonable
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirement in terms of what their
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
everyday job is
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
I can concur representative uh
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
some are able to run marathons but they
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
can't do a sit-up or push-up to save
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
their life some can do a hundred sit-ups
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
and 100 push-ups
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh I just think that what representative
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
Muse was saying is we we can tweak this
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
so it's just not those three sit-ups
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
push-ups mile and a half it might be
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
something else to show that you are in
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
shape and physically fit and that
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be that those three uh
 
00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be that those three uh
criteria

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:44.990 align:start position:0%
criteria
um

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else you get a
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
comment representative
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
no I've I've taken enough of your time
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could call up the uh
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
members of the police standards and
 
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.850 align:start position:0%
members of the police standards and
training

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman good morning
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
folks I appreciate your time for the
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
record John skippa director of police
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
standards and training and with me is
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
Captain Adam Hawkins who is the bureau
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
chief for uh professional development
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
and online learning uh who all Saul
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
the goal is shared by everyone in the
 
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.090 align:start position:0%
the goal is shared by everyone in the
room

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
and that is from our perspective
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh the overall Wellness of the officer
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
is our goal that's really what we're
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
trying to establish and trying to help
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
maintain throughout that officer's
 
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.810 align:start position:0%
maintain throughout that officer's
career

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.820 align:start position:0%
career
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh I'll go as far as to say that uh
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Muse uh in my opinion did
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of of providing that
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
summary of really what we're aiming at
 
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:12.419 align:start position:0%
which is the the the totality of
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
Wellness not only from the physical
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
point of view but also from a mental
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
health point of view uh candidly we need
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
to fit in financial Wellness as as part
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
of that uh training program there's a
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
lot of young police officers that get
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
into the business and they don't know
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
how to balance a checkbook or plan for
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
the future those are those are all
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
things that are vitally important uh
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we see as an opportunity to help
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now the tests that we
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
require police officers to take the
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
fitness tests
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
are tied directly to their certification
 
00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:58.460 align:start position:0%
it is very much a regulatory function
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
this fitness test was established 23
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
years ago and
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and and the relationship is between
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the individual officer and police
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
standards and training who issue that
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
license to them
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so the council's position right now
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and as it was uh 23 years ago was
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
that police officers in the state of New
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to maintain a level of
 
00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to maintain a level of
fitness

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
fitness
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
as part of uh their ability to
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
the present test that we use
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
for the regulatory function of measuring
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
whether a person is able to meet the
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
physical demands of being a police
 
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
physical demands of being a police
officer

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is probably not the best test to use
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
that is really
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
that is my opinion and I don't want to
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
speak for the captain but I believe the
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
captain would agree that there's
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
alternative testing out there that
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
really is a much uh much more in line
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
with what we're trying to accomplish
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
the sad truth is that it's difficult to
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.450 align:start position:0%
the sad truth is that it's difficult to
create

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh situations to measure functional
 
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.130 align:start position:0%
uh situations to measure functional
capacity

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
when one of those things that you're
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
trying to measure is an officer's
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to be in a physical
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
altercation for a minute
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
recreate that in a safe way
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
and so uh in the past and as it stands
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
right now the reason that that officer
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
runs a mile and a half is to demonstrate
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
that they have the cardiovascular
 
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
that they have the cardiovascular
capacity

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
in a protracted physical altercation
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's kind of we're kind of doing a
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
little translation that if they can run
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
that mile and a half and that amount of
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
time then they should be able to uh
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
defend themselves and stay safe if
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're attacked
 
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.370 align:start position:0%
they're attacked
again

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
we're using a little translation right
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
between those two events
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
it is it is our opinion that we we
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
probably need to look at a more
 
00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:25.730 align:start position:0%
probably need to look at a more
functional

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
functional
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
test that mirrors those things that a
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
police officer will have to do
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they're 20 or 40
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
or 60 whether they're a man or a woman
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
or candidly transgender we're not what
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
we want to do is create a test that is a
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
single test for the position of a law
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer period
 
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.370 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer period
uh

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:54.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have a subcommittee that we are
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
working on with members of the New
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs Association
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to exploring alternatives to
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
I would say that really
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
the thing that is in front of us
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh I guess from our perspective my
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
enough support
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
to look at using a different test
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
or does the legislature feel that we
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
need to just do away with the test
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
because remember it's regulatory in
 
00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
because remember it's regulatory in
nature

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh looking at the proposal this
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
morning uh absolutely uh this would be a
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
way to go about doing it
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it would need to be
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
captured in law I think really what
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
would happen is if the uh
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to just go forward and
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
that physical fitness test be removed
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be that we would
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
we would try to create
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
an overall wellness program
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh as kind of a voluntary thing to push
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
out to all the agencies across the state
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the states would have their excuse
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
me the towns and cities would have their
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
own opportunity to build their own test
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
as well in their own wellness program
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that it would need to be
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
captured in statute
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
I do look at the proposal under Roman
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
numeral 10
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
where there's an officer that maybe
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
could not pass their
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
their test in a three-year period and
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
they get six-month extensions up to the
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
five-year Mark where they have to pass
 
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
five-year Mark where they have to pass
it

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.909 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
the way I'm reading 10 and I may I may
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
not be understanding it but it
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
it certainly allows somebody to just not
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
have to pass any test as long as they're
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
participating in some type of wellness
 
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.430 align:start position:0%
participating in some type of wellness
program

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.770 align:start position:0%
program
uh

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
I do agree with the the notion that we
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
have to use the carrot and not the stick
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
right that's our goal is to make sure
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
that these folks stay healthy
 
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
that these folks stay healthy
uh

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
but I do think that the the
 
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation under house bill
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
113 right now is just asking
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
do we want to leave this as part of the
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory function and mandate every
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
police officer to pass a test whatever
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
that test might be
 
00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:43.669 align:start position:0%
that test might be
or

00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
do we just want to get rid of it and
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
allow people and agencies to create
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
their own Standalone program for their
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
agency in their town
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally uh this uh topic and this
 
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.049 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally uh this uh topic and this
bill

00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:00.059 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
is of national interest right now and I
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody here in this
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee knows that or not but
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
um this uh is a a very hot topic Across
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
the Nation
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a lot of people watching
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire is going to get
 
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.020 align:start position:0%
rid of this three-year test
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of people who are
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
saying that we should not get rid of the
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
test we should not get rid of it
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
now I'm sure a lot of those people who
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
are writing that we shouldn't get rid of
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
it didn't have to take a three-year test
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
when they were working you know out on
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
the West Coast or in the in the central
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
part of our country nonetheless
 
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.350 align:start position:0%
part of our country nonetheless
um

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
it is my firm belief that working with
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs and with New Hampshire Police
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
Association I think they should be at
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
the table and the sheriff's Association
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
I think if we were given the opportunity
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
to revisit what we're using for testing
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
trying to find something that is going
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
to be more functionally uh related to
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
the job of a police officer creating a
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
single cut test with a single number
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh may I think that's the way that we
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
should probably look at this
 
00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:25.010 align:start position:0%
should probably look at this
alternatively

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.409 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
I would say that if
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
if the legislature's belief was that now
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
we really don't want to worry about uh
 
00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:41.179 align:start position:0%
police officers or Corrections Officers
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
they should kind of be responsible for
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
themselves or their agency should be
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
responsible then you know certainly uh
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
House Bill 113 as written right now
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
would if it were to pass it would that
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
would create that kind of opportunity
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
for local control
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
and it would be one less regulatory
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
function that we would have to to look
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
over I think from a regulatory point of
 
00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:11.779 align:start position:0%
view this proposal would probably
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
be much more I not probably it would be
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult for us to manage from
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory point of view I think
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
this would be a very difficult thing for
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
us to kind of keep track of
 
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.570 align:start position:0%
us to kind of keep track of
um

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anyone has any questions
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
or Captain if you wanted to offer
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
represent him slow thank you
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh director if this bill was to pass do
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
you think some pandemonium would ensue
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
in the law enforcement community in New
 
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.890 align:start position:0%
in the law enforcement community in New
Hampshire

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
I think that there would be
 
00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:58.490 align:start position:0%
I think that there would be
um

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
when you say pandemonium among the
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
police or or among the among the among
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
the police I'm sorry among the police
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
that this affects so I there's going to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
be a lot of people If This Were to pass
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
and we got rid of this three-year
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
testing I think there are some police
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
officers that would be very happy to see
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
that go away uh because then they would
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
not be held to any kind of uh oversight
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
with regard to them maintaining some
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
level of Fitness they would be very
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
happy about that and they would
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh not have to worry about passing a
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
test they would not have to worry about
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
working out they would not have to be
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
worried about taking care of themselves
 
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.190 align:start position:0%
worried about taking care of themselves
uh

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I I think there'd be a group that
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
would be very happy about that I think
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
that there would be a group of police
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
officers that would be very disappointed
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
because because we're the only state in
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the country that does this
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
there are some unmeasured benefits to
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
this program in that the police officers
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
that work in New Hampshire right now we
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
know you have to pass this test every
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
three years I'll even stretch it out
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
every five years you've got to pass this
 
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.890 align:start position:0%
every five years you've got to pass this
test

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a lot of bosses out
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
there that um would be really
 
00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:17.899 align:start position:0%
disappointed to see this go
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding uh not so much with
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
recruitment but certainly retention
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
recruitment is recruitment they're going
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
to have to take a fitness test to come
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
to the academy anyway so that that has
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
no balance a separate element uh but
 
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.930 align:start position:0%
no balance a separate element uh but
retention

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
that may that may have some play May
 
00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:40.549 align:start position:0%
that may that may have some play May
maybe

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
um we again it's difficult to measure
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
how many people we lose annually because
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
they can't pass the test because a lot
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
of it is mirrored as uh just a normal
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
retirement the officer has has made
 
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:54.380 align:start position:0%
their time
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
and they have decided not to stay and so
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
they retire we don't know why they
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
didn't stay
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
how many decertifications occur annually
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
for the sole purpose of not being able
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
to complete a PT test at the three or
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so we've
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
been talking about a lot of what-ifs how
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
many people have left
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
my position as Captain
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
um is to look at the data since coming
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
to the academy I'm going to
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
self-deprecate a little bit I might look
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
like I'm coming out of college but I've
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
been in law enforcement this is my 20th
 
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.350 align:start position:0%
been in law enforcement this is my 20th
year

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.020 align:start position:0%
so coming to the academy in 2018
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
Wellness physical fitness was all was
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
obviously a priority of mine and we've
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
been talking about uh changing or
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
enhancing this test for a while
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
specifically when it comes to running
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
I deal specifically with every aspect of
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
physical fitness testing in the state so
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's people who are doing their
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
three-year PT tests I've helped officers
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
train to come to the academy I've helped
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
officers come back from injury I speak
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
with people who are let's say in a
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
probationary status or people who have
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
gone over their five-year and and are
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
looking for help to get or pass their
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
test to get back on the job so we've
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
talked about how many people have left
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the three-year pts
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
coming up but I can specifically speak
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the data because we have a training
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
management learning management system
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we use to record that data so over
 
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:39.740 align:start position:0%
the past I would say about three years
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
we've had 3 892 tests
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
that we that we can point to
 
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:49.460 align:start position:0%
we have about
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
801 grandfathered officers in the state
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
who don't actually actually have to take
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
the test so actually looking at the
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
tests with the people who are actually
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
taking the test
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
um it's about 90 100 tests that I could
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
look at in the past three years of those
 
00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.370 align:start position:0%
look at in the past three years of those
tests

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:06.380 align:start position:0%
tests
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
94.6 percent of them passed the three
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
year test we have about
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
about five percent who's in a
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
probationary or a medical status
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the question that you're
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
asking about how many people that we can
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
just point to uh data about 15 officers
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
over the past uh three years have not
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
passed their tests and have been
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
suspended so that's about less than a
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
half half percent of officers who try to
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
take this test go into that suspension
 
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.010 align:start position:0%
take this test go into that suspension
status

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
clarifying question yep that includes
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
part-time and full-time that's all
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
certified officers in the state of New
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so Corrections part-time
 
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.330 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so Corrections part-time
full-time

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
yes represent Gathering
 
00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.570 align:start position:0%
yes represent Gathering
um

00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
the the running tests for it can you
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
tell me what's the minutes or when they
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
do that run half a one and a half mile
 
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.029 align:start position:0%
do that run half a one and a half mile
run

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
so the oh I'm sorry in how many minutes
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
are up
 
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:18.380 align:start position:0%
shower yeah so
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
I wish it was a half I was gonna say I'm
 
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
with you
[Laughter]

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh so it is dependent on your age and
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's dependent on your gender
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
so uh a 20 year old male will have to
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
run their test their their mile and a
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
half and uh what is it 1256 is it
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
1253 12 minutes and 53 seconds
 
00:33:50.409 --> 00:33:50.419 align:start position:0%
as a 60 year old man I
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh I would have an extra five minutes to
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
run my mile and a half and in both cases
 
00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:01.070 align:start position:0%
run my mile and a half and in both cases
uh

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
it's considered a pass
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
so I think if you I think this is a
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
great example Madam where
 
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.810 align:start position:0%
great example Madam where
um

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
the Cooper test that we use right now we
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
are asking people to demonstrate how
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
healthy they are
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
as compared
 
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
as compared
to

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
people who are in the same age bracket
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the same gender
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
so when we have a 25 year old male we're
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
asking them to be physically fit
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh to a degree that that they're at
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
least 35 percent more physically fit
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
than people who are 20 to 29 years of
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
if we have a 45 year old female
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
incumbent officer
 
00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
presently the Cooper standards require
 
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:54.980 align:start position:0%
them to demonstrate a level of Fitness
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
where they are at least
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
35 percent
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
more fit
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
than women between the ages of 40 and
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
today

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
you can go to Captain you know
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
makes the rules as to what the officer
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
so in in my opinion when I look at this
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're not telling you how to do your
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
training that's up to you we're just
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying you have to do certain trainings
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
so for me I really don't even understand
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
why we really have this bill I'm trying
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
to figure it out
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
um because you can decide how you want
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
your training to be anyway without us
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
so why would we remove this I think
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that you have to have
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
a certain types of training and I like
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative Muse idea that it doesn't
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a physical
 
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.470 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a physical
training

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
how you present these training is up to
 
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.050 align:start position:0%
how you present these training is up to
you

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're not specific as to that that's
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
what you do you make the specificate of
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
the training not us
 
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.810 align:start position:0%
the training not us
so

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
still like this
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
I think uh representative gaththright I
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying like how
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
are you going to train to get that mile
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
and a half whether you run or you
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
bicycle or your swim but it's you still
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
have to meet that specific requirement
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh for push-ups I don't know you're
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
juggling Stones uh just throwing stuff
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
out there yeah but it's not like set up
 
00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
on how you have to pass it it's just
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you have to pass it at that
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
particular right but the determination
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
as to passing comes from the trainers
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
for the developers of the training
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come from US
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
Representative Stone first sorry uh I
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
think some confusions coming in between
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
wellness and physical fitness standards
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
most agencies that I'm aware of I think
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
still do both they're two separate
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
issues and usually most agencies handle
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
the wellness is kind of more like a I
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't know it's more like an insurance
 
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
thing through their you know primex or
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
whoever their carrier is so most
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
agencies do have the wellness program
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
built in and it serves for a specific
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
differences between the physical fitness
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
that you're measuring for proficiency
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
than just a well wellness program
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
so most agencies I believe I would say
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire by this time must have
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know some option of a wellness
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
program that's optional usually that's
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
included but the regulatory standard is
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
that an individual officer has to pass
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
the physical fitness test
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
every three years then you have graduate
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
waivers for what you said up to five
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
years currently
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that's what we're really
 
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
looking at and they're looking at is
 
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:54.950 align:start position:0%
looking at and they're looking at is
that

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
cumbersome is it prohibitive to have the
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
to do pt when it comes to recruitment
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
for out-of-state officers that want to
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
come here for a job I know that's one of
 
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
the things I think I heard during
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony for the original bill when it
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
was presented
 
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.250 align:start position:0%
was presented
um additionally

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
um additionally
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that I am aware of and
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
you could speak to this director or
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
Captain that doesn't an agency could
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
have their own standards they establish
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's higher than what the state
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
requires is that is that correct thank
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
you for that question that's absolutely
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct we uh we set minimum standards
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire police centers and
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
training Council actually sets these
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
standards and uh statutorily as it
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
stands right now the council has that
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to establish
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
whatever fitness test the council feels
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
is most appropriate but agencies can set
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
the bar higher uh there are agencies
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
that set higher physical fitness
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
standards and they say hey if you want
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
to work here you have to be able to do
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
even more push-ups and sit-ups than pstc
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
asks for
 
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
asks for
um

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:03.609 --> 00:39:03.619 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
whether agencies have Wellness programs
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
or not we can't speak that we don't know
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh and it would be presumptive
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
for me to say that a majority of them do
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't know uh
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
just for a follow-up yes so with an
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
example still be the New Hampshire State
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
Police that require a higher uh Fitness
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
standard than the regular locals coming
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
in or Municipal coming in through the
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
academy for the basic trading if they
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a higher standard which would not
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
surprise me I'm not aware of it but they
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
certainly can set that bar higher if
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
they choose to the same thing with a
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
pistol qualification quite frankly
 
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
there's some agencies that hold their
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
officers to a higher uh pistol
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
qualification then what we would from a
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory point of view
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
so let's say just as an example the New
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police have a higher
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
Fitness standard and that Trooper
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass it and I I don't know this
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're using this just as an example then
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
that Trooper might be dismissed from you
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
know employment situation but they
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
haven't lost their certification because
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
they can still pass it at at our state
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
level requirements right
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
so that's more of an employment
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
relationship than a certification
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
relationship thank you
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh just a comment on that when I was
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
hired with the state police back in 0-1
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
it actually was the same as the Lawrence
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
now I don't know in the time since I've
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
left that it's higher but I know it was
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
at least the minimum that the academy
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
had uh representative Manion and then
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and correct me if I'm wrong uh
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative the gas right but I want
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
to try to answer or at least explain her
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
question how I understood it
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
there's a law that was put in place 23
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
years ago requiring the academy to
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh conduct this sort of this training
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
every three years and she's wondering if
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
you if you're in charge of regulating
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
the training and this law disappears
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
can't you just hold that test every
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
three years anyways or is it as a result
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the current law that says you have to
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
she's wondering if we get rid of this
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill does that change anything of this
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
law so I didn't am I wrong and yeah and
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to ask
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
so the per what's the purpose of us
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
being here repealing this flaw if you
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
could just make that
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that standard every three years as a
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory decision
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
only because it's captured it's
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
presently captured in 106 L uh
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
six I believe
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh uh no uh
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh eight nine and ten I believe
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
eight nine and ten
 
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.109 align:start position:0%
eight nine and ten
uh

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
presently as as statutorily
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
under 106
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
the council has
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
the uh the ability to
 
00:41:59.530 --> 00:41:59.540 align:start position:0%
create a fitness test
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
and we use that as and
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing the word training and
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
testing and those are two different
 
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.290 align:start position:0%
testing and those are two different
things

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
testing is what we're talking about here
 
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.210 align:start position:0%
testing is what we're talking about here
so

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
right now statutorily
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
police station training Council
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.460 align:start position:0%
physical test
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
that needs to be passed every three
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
years by every police officer law
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of New
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order for them to maintain
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
their certification
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
whatever that test is
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
can be decided by the council
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
so the council has the authority to
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
switch the test from the Cooper
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
standards which is what we're using now
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
to a different test
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're this subcommittee
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Chiefs that's
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to figure out is
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
what is an alternative test that we can
 
00:42:58.319 --> 00:42:59.210 align:start position:0%
what is an alternative test that we can
use

00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
that is more functional
 
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:03.020 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh maybe a little bit
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
I hate to use the word easier but it
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
just makes more sense to switch to a
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
more functional test than the present
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
test that we are using
 
00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:19.220 align:start position:0%
If This Were to go away
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
then there would be no Fitness
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
requirement for police officers from our
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory point of view we would not be
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
doing Fitness testing as part of those
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
officers maintaining their certification
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
their license I don't know if that I
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that answers the question okay so
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
if the bill is repealed
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
you would not require that even though
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
you have regulatory Authority you would
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
not require a three-year
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
fitness test to maintain certification
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
if hb113 were to to pass that that is
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
director is there a timetable on that
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the the subcommittee getting
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
something workable uh there's thank you
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
for that question there's no specific
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
timetable we knew uh when this bill was
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
first introduced uh there was a lot of
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
discussion at New Hampshire Chiefs
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
meeting I don't want to speak for their
 
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.069 align:start position:0%
meeting I don't want to speak for their
organization

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
but I do know that they saw that this
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
was such an important bill that they
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
created a subcommittee uh and invited uh
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
myself and the captain to participate in
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
to try to find an alternative test or or
 
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.790 align:start position:0%
to try to find an alternative test or or
to

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
decide whether uh the three-year testing
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be repealed or whether it
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
should be held and and again I don't
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
want to speak for that organization but
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
I do know that there was uh a there was
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
vigorous discussion and uh there was a
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
lot of points of view and I think that's
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
part of what that uh that subcommittee
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
is working on right now thank you
 
00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
so as legislators we have a bunch of
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
choices right now
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we could do is is
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
we could itl the bill
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and then put forward a different bill
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
um more along the lines of something
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
that might Garner more support within
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
police because it seems like right now
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
police are pretty divided on this as
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
well which is one of the reasons why I
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
think why the Chiefs didn't take a
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
position on this
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
um another thing that we could do
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
um and it would require
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh probably uh a fair amount of effort
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
on your part but accelerate that
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
timetable so one of the options that's
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
available to the committee is to retain
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend that the chair
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
retain the bill we can't retain the bill
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh and work on it over the summer
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
and over the summer one of the things
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
that we could do is get an update from
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
from you on the status of what the
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is coming up with is there
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
does that proposal address at least some
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
of the concerns you know that have been
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
brought brought forward uh brought
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and and I guess maybe to uh
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know I I think uh representative
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
tenzar asked a uh probably the most
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
pertinent question of the moment which
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
is how far along is the subcommittee uh
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
because I think that will have a lot to
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
do I know with with what I just what I
 
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.690 align:start position:0%
do I know with with what I just what I
decide

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you director I know you've been
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
around for a few minutes can you
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
remember how long the Cooper standard
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
has been utilized at the New Hampshire
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
State Police Academy
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
I do uh thank you for that question I
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
was a uh
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
I look like him 23 years ago and uh my
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
job uh at the police academy as a
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
training specialist was to roll this
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
program out so we roll I rolled the
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
program out Statewide it went into
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
effect uh January 1st 2001 and so uh
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
probably a year before that I started to
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
create a bunch of training material a
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
training class to roll out to New
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and then get uh
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
folks certified to be able to run the
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
test at their agency
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
just clarification but the Cooper
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
standards have been used at the police
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
academy predate that correct
 
00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:36.650 align:start position:0%
academy predate that correct
uh

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.690 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
so I would say as not a three-year test
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
so for yourself but just general Cooper
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
standards that's utilized by the police
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
academy for recruitment so to to uh
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
provide that answer I will tell you when
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
I went to the police academy in 1989
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
there was no Cooper standards we had a a
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
a number of tests a mile and a half run
 
00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
a shuttle run a dummy drag push-up
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
sit-ups I can't tell you where any of
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
those Target numbers came from
 
00:48:16.329 --> 00:48:16.339 align:start position:0%
when I was a training specialist from uh
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
1991 to 2000 and
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
no uh 1998 to 2003
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
we use Cooper standards for Fitness
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
testing for recruits
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
so it was there
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
at least 1998
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.069 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
representative

00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
I went through in 1995 but I am 99 sure
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
use Cooper then as well could be wrong
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that was uh that
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
was nice yes I did not look like him 23
 
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.230 align:start position:0%
was nice yes I did not look like him 23
years

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
I'm actually 25 and this is what I look
 
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.530 align:start position:0%
I'm actually 25 and this is what I look
like

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else that cares to
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
speak upon uh director do you have
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
anything else you'd like to add to this
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
no I I appreciate that sir thank you and
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I guess I would ask if there was
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
any ability for this uh subcommittee to
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
to maybe just allow us some time to uh
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know really work on this from uh
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
from the stakeholders point of view
 
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.290 align:start position:0%
from the stakeholders point of view
right

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
and and really uh dig deep on you know
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
how much is this pinching recruitment
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
and retention
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
how difficult is this for uh these
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies to retain folks is
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
there a better test that would be more
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
strongly embraced by the rank and file
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
or whether it really needs to go away
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
you know and and that and that's that's
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
on the table we don't take that off the
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
table that that could be a viable option
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
here that ultimately we decide on but if
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
there was any way we could get more time
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
this to me is a very important question
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
how we proceed is really what is your
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that uh certainly if we were
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
given until the next legislative cycle
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we we certainly would be able to uh
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
we would be more ready and when I say we
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
collectively I'm speaking maybe out of
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
out of school here but I think the law
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community would probably be
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
able to give more definitive positions
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
once this is kind of Knocked around a
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
little bit if that helps sir it does I'm
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
not going to hold you to the time frames
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
but this is a big undertaking I believe
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
20 years ago there was discussion about
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
different standards that could be
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
implemented for more job specific and
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
gender neutral even back then before
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
General was really a term
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
but I can appreciate your your honesty
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
as far as your bandwidth goes because it
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
is a huge undertaking to try to change
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I understand that thank you thank
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the committee
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
well it looks like it's crunch time
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
one last call is there anyone that would
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
wish to come and speak
 
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
wish to come and speak
okay

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
so we have a couple uh as representative
 
00:51:36.849 --> 00:51:36.859 align:start position:0%
Muse said we have some options here um
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
after reading a reading listening to
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
director skippa
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
I think I've changed my position on this
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
uh there still will be the physical
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
fitness requirements uh but we're
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
removing the regulatory aspect which I
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
think is a burden on
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
police standards local apartments even
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
on officers I don't think that if we
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
ought to pass this that officers are
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to be getting out of shape and you
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
know injuring themselves I just think
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
that this takes it out of
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
our hands and gives it to people who
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
know better than we do the academy and
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
the local departments I think that this
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
will help with retention uh so I I'm
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
going with ought to pass representative
 
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.030 align:start position:0%
going with ought to pass representative
Stone

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
Stone
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
I'll make the Motion Auto pass
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh chair votes yes on ought to pass
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Manion yes Representative
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
gathright no representative Muse
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass three to two
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
and we will send the report up to uh of
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank everyone and
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative for presenting your bill
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
uh we should be hearing this on Friday
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
from the full committee I believe
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to thank everyone and I will
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
close uh the subcommittee on House Bill
 
00:53:11.099 --> 00:53:14.089 align:start position:0%
close uh the subcommittee on House Bill
113.

00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the committee uh take a five-minute
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
I think that was ridiculous because it
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
should have been we should have held it
 
00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
we should have retained it
 
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.290 align:start position:0%
we should have retained it
yeah

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
realistically

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
this can be a very very busy Cuts yeah
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
pushing the time things this is they've
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
been talking about this for 20 plus
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
years about trying to come up with more
 
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.130 align:start position:0%
years about trying to come up with more
jobs

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
afraid are taking it he's taking it but
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
he claimed that they've gotten a group
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
together and they did yeah and they
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually said that when they were here
 
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.809 align:start position:0%
actually said that when they were here
um

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I forget his name from
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay so that five minute break was about
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
25 minutes my apologies to
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative Manion
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
at this time I will be opening The
 
01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:57.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Works session on House Bill
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
305 and I will be calling representative
 
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
Tom Manion
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chair thank you
 
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I didn't have a
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
prepared statement this time because I
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that whatever
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
questions you guys got you just fire
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
them at me I did pass out this uh
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
handout so it made it a lot clearer what
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do because I think
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
before when I just read it to you guys
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't really get carry across what I
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
thought the problem in the existing law
 
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.790 align:start position:0%
thought the problem in the existing law
was

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
so if you read the top bolded part here
 
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:23.810 align:start position:0%
so if you read the top bolded part here
it

01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
this this entire section here uh 159 uh
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
E2 is basically an exception to the
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
existing uh fire firearm Sanctuary law
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
that we have so it says you the the just
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
because they're violating a federal
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
firearms law does not preclude local law
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement from helping the feds if
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's some other crime occurring so in
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
the case like it would be you know an
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
assault mass murder whatever it may be
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh the fear of the original Law When It
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
Was Written uh 159 E1
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
the fear was that the way it was worded
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
it could act as a shield if an
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
individual was only violating a federal
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
firearms law and then also committing
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
some other crime that our local law
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement couldn't help the feds in at
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
you know apprehending this person so
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
there was this big carve output here but
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
I feel like the the language here is so
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly broad it actually nullifies
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
the intent of the original section that
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's within it says so the the
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
exclusions include
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
any violation of New Hampshire law or
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
any violation of a federal law
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
regulation order or practice that's
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
everything under the Sun so you know
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
jaywalking is covered in this so you
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
could be you know violating a federal
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
firearms law and uh because you're
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
jaywalking at the same time our local
 
01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:48.260 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can just ignore uh 1591
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
and render Aid
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
or support to the federal uh
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
apprehension of the individual that is
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
doing nothing more than exercising their
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights and the FEDS
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't like that so the my language in
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
the second new just shrinks it down to
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
where it would actually make sense for
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
us to aid class a felony which covers
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
murder uh violent assault uh drug
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
charges even or even covered by it in uh
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
sexual crime so if you have any
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
questions about like what the intent
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
here is or if there's anything I may
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
a question of curiosity is why didn't we
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
do Class B felonies
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
so the idea here was to cover the more
 
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
violent of the crimes because like here
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
Class B felonies uh a small amount of
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
illegal substances uh theft of small
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
property Computer Fraud
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
things along those lines and it I mean
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
they don't the feds don't need our help
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
with something like that there's
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's life that's in danger that
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
requires local law enforcement to help
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
the feds in their apprehension but under
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
state laws are there quite a few uh
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
Class B felonies that are invoked on
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
crimes against persons
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
it so the idea here is the class a
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
felony was to cover the
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
um violent crime bucket like there's a
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
lot of things that like to describe
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
things as violent crime and I from it's
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
my understanding there's nothing that
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
just straight up says this is a violent
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
crime because there was some nebulous
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
language with that because I remember
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
there was another bill you guys heard
 
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.290 align:start position:0%
there was another bill you guys heard
about

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
um violent felons per se that would get
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
their firearms rights back and there was
 
01:23:30.770 --> 01:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
some contention on what qualifies as a
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
violent felony whereas class a felony to
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
meet covered the entire bucket of where
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
it would be an emergency situation that
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
would require local law enforcement to
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
also Aid the feds in whatever was
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
happening anything else should be
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
covered the feds can more than handle it
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
as I understand this representative
 
01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:52.940 align:start position:0%
Manion that this was from House Bill
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
1178 that's correct okay that was the
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
original Law this was signed into law
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
with the the change to the laws you
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
proposed it cover
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the ability of the state and federal
 
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
government to cooperate uh investigating
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who is making illegal straw
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
currently no
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
this straw purchases
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
do you have representative man
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm just trying to
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand I wasn't a part of this when
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
let's say the federal government is
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
conducting an operation uh it's related
 
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
to gun rights uh we don't get involved
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
in it however there's a Class B felon
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
that they discover and and form the
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
local police about
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
the local police don't address it at
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but down the road maybe they conduct
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
an investigation on that beef felony is
 
01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:22.550 align:start position:0%
an investigation on that beef felony is
that

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
precluded from this as well I mean no if
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's some other crime they can still
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
investigate the crime the protection
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
here is against specifically cooperating
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the feds against violations of your
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh natural right to bear arms so it
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be like in the moment whatever it
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
may be if there's if there's other
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
crimes come to light other crime crimes
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
come to light
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to representative Stone yeah
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
just speaking on the store purchases
 
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's usually enforced by federal
 
01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.270 align:start position:0%
that's usually enforced by federal
agencies

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
as a primary item of enforcement
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
not as like a secondary that's normally
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
the ATF that handles that yes
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tom Union could you
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
give like a real world example as to the
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
current law versus your proposal right
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
so they it was something similar to what
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
I was just describing let's say I uh
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
just so happened to let's say an assault
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
weapons ban comes down the pipe and uh
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
I want to buy it anyway in New Hampshire
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we pass a law that just ignores it
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
and I purchase a
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
you know assault what they Define as an
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
assault weapon but then I also happen to
 
01:26:27.179 --> 01:26:27.890 align:start position:0%
assault weapon but then I also happen to
have

01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
um a small amount of cannabis in my
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
pocket uh the under the current law
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement would see that oh
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
well your violating a federal law uh the
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
d The Drug Enforcement Act and uh and
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
you're also violating this gun law we
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
can't enforce the gun law but because
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you got that weed in your pocket we can
 
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
help the feds detain you
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay so you're just you're really trying
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
to remove the oversight of the feds onto
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the local Army yeah more or less the
 
01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
idea here is uh
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to use good language uh
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
trying to not be the federal
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
government's Whipping Boy or so to say
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
or to to be at their beck and call to
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
enforce laws that we don't believe in in
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
this state that we should not believe in
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
in this state uh should not be something
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the law enforcement should be
 
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
tasked to do I think it's a waste of
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
resources I think it's a trains our
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
police in a bad uh way of thinking uh
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative guthright
 
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.790 align:start position:0%
representative guthright
so

01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
then what's happening
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
the local police can't do anything
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
for for if there's so the idea here is
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
the entire law protects against a a
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
federal gun whatever it may be like an
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
apprehension a raid whatever it is
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
if a class a felony is occurring at the
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
same time that's that could the local
 
01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
and state could help right but right now
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written right now it
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be it could be any it
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
literally says a violation of a federal
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
law regulation order or practice that's
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
all kinds of stuff if you dig deep
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
enough you're breaking a law right now
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
if you dig deep enough through uh all
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
the federal bureaucracy and every single
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
regulation that exists so the S
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so the essence of it if
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a felony B then that
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
means that the police department cannot
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
act not for yes not in the enforcement
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
of a federal gun gun law by the ATF or
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be yeah sorry I know
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
that this is yeah I tried to make it
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
like this is the simplest I thought this
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
was such a simple Bill all into is
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
shrinking it down because if you read
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
this first paragraph I don't know how
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can see that this isn't like a
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
humongous loophole and basically it
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
provides no protection it completely
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
guts the original Law the intent and I'm
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure whoever wrote it that wasn't their
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
intention I'm sure there was more uh
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
well we want to make sure that if the
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
guys uh you know a mass shooter that he
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
should the that the feds were trying to
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
apprehend that our local law enforcement
 
01:29:01.689 --> 01:29:01.699 align:start position:0%
can of course go and help
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I was here for that and um I I
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
think what happened was in order to get
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
that bill through that's the what was
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
written The Way It Was Written I've
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
heard I've heard that same exact story
 
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
yeah the A.G I think said that he was
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
going to advise the governor to not sign
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
the law unless there was some kind of uh
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
exclusion to because there's other
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
components in here that there are
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's other rsas that we have to
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
enforce with the feds regardless and
 
01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure that all of
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was covered I just think that this
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
one specific sentence was just overly
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
Broad and it really defeats the purpose
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the entire section whether that was
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
intentionally or intentional or not they
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be like a uh paying lip
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
service to uh gun rights and not
 
01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
actually be gun rights I guess that's
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see if this bill passes or not or
 
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
gets signed
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
and to follow up with uh representative
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
gaththright I did speak with Senator
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
Abbas about this who is one of the ones
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
who crafted it he said that again they
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
fought tooth and nail to get where they
 
01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:56.060 align:start position:0%
got and I I do appreciate this
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
clarification of the wordage yeah uh
 
01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.410 align:start position:0%
clarification of the wordage yeah uh
because

01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government has a lot of
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
resources they can do their own job
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
State local County or a small state we
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
should be focusing on our own so I
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand how you're trying to really
 
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
show this all up I just don't know if
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
how hard fought it was last year that
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
this will go through but that's
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
something we're gonna have to see on the
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
on the board yeah how we're going to
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
vote yeah and like this whole thing
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
comes up like if you look I mentioned it
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
in the hearing before there's a Twitter
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
account called like crime a day and they
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
just said that like if they tweet a a
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
federal crime that you could commit
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
every day it would it would be like the
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
heat death of the universe before they
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
managed to tweet one a day but like of
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
all the crimes you could potentially be
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
breaking any regulation which is what
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
this would be we've seen a lot of the
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
the gun bills I know representative
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
Manny you testified on some of those
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
that they change the laws as they wish
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
if whatever way the wind blows and it's
 
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
I mean representative Stone could attest
 
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
to this and that that's just gun laws
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is literally it says any regulation
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be ATF it could be
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
the you know EPA regulation it could be
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Agriculture regulation
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
if your your seeds are doing the wrong
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
thing whatever it may be you know they
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah just a just a question if if a
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
crime violates
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
both state and federal law
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a small state that
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have adequate police resources
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
the way that it stands now want to turn
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
down help from the federal government if
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's also a violation it's the other way
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
around of our law right this is the
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
other way around it would be the feds
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
are already enforcing a gun gun law that
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
is on their books and the original Law
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
here prohibits our law enforcement from
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
aiding them in that process so it's like
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's the opposite of what you're
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
describing and that's why I have a
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
problem with it because they're in the
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
feds if they want to enforce their dumb
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
laws they should do it on their dime and
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
not be tasking our law enforcement to
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
help them enforce whatever whims they
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you just for
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh clarification for the subcommittee uh
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that no
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
there is no NFA laws which is uh
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
National firearm Act laws which are
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
referred to as class threes New
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have any laws on the
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
books from relevance to NFA laws however
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
the federal government has a sole
 
01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
purpose of enacting by either uh
 
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
Congressional or by rulemaking Authority
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
through the ATF such as an example would
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
be the pistol race law that just came
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
down there was it's a lot it's a law but
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
it's really a ruling that the ATF has
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
redefined and I think this is the type
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
of example that could be best suited
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
since our attorney general's already
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
signed on with 24 other states to fight
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
this one yeah
 
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
I just want to carry on there's one
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
other thing that was on their website
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
for a short stint of time there was a
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
law that says if you had an NFA item uh
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
you could not even let someone borrow it
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
unless they were registered with it that
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
was on their website that wasn't that
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
didn't even go through the rulemaking
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
process that was just something they
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
threw on a website and who knows what
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
that whether they'd enforce it or not
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to know representative
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
Stone so basically you're taking the
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
same position that this would avoid any
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh rule-making Authority or executive
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
orders that lack due process absolutely
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
yes that's the entire purpose of this
 
01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.950 align:start position:0%
yes that's the entire purpose of this
yep

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
represent Mania thank you for coming to
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
clarify I know it was uh everyone was
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a little confused and I know you
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
explained the bill to me prior to and I
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to to have you come up to really
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
explain it in a better way because I
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
know that you have some really good uh a
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
good bill here uh cool
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess we're
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
also did we have a motion
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah my motion to it out the bill
 
01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:48.590 align:start position:0%
yeah my motion to it out the bill
second

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:58.850 align:start position:0%
second

01:34:04.199 --> 01:34:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
no

representative gathright
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Muse yes representative
 
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
Stone no
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
tens are as a no
 
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
represents Stone motion to Auto pass
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
do I have a second representative tensor
 
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:46.250 align:start position:0%
do I have a second representative tensor
seconds

01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Dennis Manu
 
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.090 align:start position:0%
representative Dennis Manu
yes

01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%

representative muse no representative
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
Stone yes and the chair votes yes and by
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
three to two ought to pass
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
to the committee I think this one is in
 
01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.350 align:start position:0%
to the committee I think this one is in
March

01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
at this time close the subcommittee work
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.669 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
305.

01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
305.
 
03:05:31.070 --> 03:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.769 --> 03:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
so it being 104 I'm going to officially
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
reopen this subcommittee work session on
 
03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
HP 107.
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
and uh there's some discussion on we
 
03:05:42.190 --> 03:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that's been sent to us
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh that representative verbill and Lynn
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
worked on together
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't know who's had an opportunity
 
03:05:50.030 --> 03:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
to review it yet but some discussion
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
03:05:55.010 --> 03:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
um just quickly I think that the
 
03:05:56.330 --> 03:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
amendment makes the bill better than the
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
one that we passed last year that didn't
 
03:05:59.809 --> 03:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
get through the Senate so so there's
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's that the the other thing and
 
03:06:03.769 --> 03:06:03.779 align:start position:0%
this is something that uh representative
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
Lynn just pointed out to me in a quick
 
03:06:07.490 --> 03:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
hallway conversation is that the the
 
03:06:09.769 --> 03:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
last two Clauses are pretty duplicative
 
03:06:12.349 --> 03:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in so there's nothing in
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
the the last part of the change that
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually is really anything different
 
03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
from before
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
um it's more more of a wordsmithing
 
03:06:23.210 --> 03:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
thing uh it's not anything that
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
materially would affect the bill one way
 
03:06:26.090 --> 03:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
or another
 
03:06:29.570 --> 03:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
so and I think the issue is if you look
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
kind of down at line 19
 
03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
kind of down at line 19
.

03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
.
 
03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know that involves direct
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
supervision of minors or that involves
 
03:06:38.330 --> 03:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
one-on-one work with minors or any
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
employment or volunteer service that
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
involves the direct supervision of
 
03:06:44.330 --> 03:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
minors so we're kind of hammering that
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
direct supervision of miners uh thing in
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
in a couple of times
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
um when it might be only necessary for
 
03:06:55.610 --> 03:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh to do it once but um the question is
 
03:06:57.530 --> 03:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
is does it materially change anything
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
and the way the bill would be enforced
 
03:07:03.530 --> 03:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think what I think the reason why it's
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's duplicated is because of the two
 
03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:08.809 align:start position:0%
it's duplicated is because of the two
separate

03:07:08.809 --> 03:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.819 --> 03:07:09.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:07:09.769 --> 03:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:11.570 --> 03:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
employment categories employment of
 
03:07:13.250 --> 03:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer activity that provides
 
03:07:15.769 --> 03:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
services exclusively or predominantly to
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
minors and then any employment of
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer services that involves direct
 
03:07:23.090 --> 03:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
supervision of minus so
 
03:07:25.250 --> 03:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
the work in a place that provides a
 
03:07:26.809 --> 03:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
service to miners
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
or whether your job requires you to be a
 
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
direct supervisor to a minor so I think
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why it looks like it's
 
03:07:35.889 --> 03:07:35.899 align:start position:0%
duplicative is that it's two separate
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
categories of employment okay one being
 
03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
so so you're saying one is if you run a
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
daycare one is if you work at Market
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
Basket basically
 
03:07:48.530 --> 03:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if you work at Market Basket and you
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
are working with an employee one-on-one
 
03:07:52.370 --> 03:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
or you're a direct supervisor to a minor
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
it would apply otherwise it wouldn't if
 
03:07:55.849 --> 03:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
you're in the dairy department and
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're working doing your shelves and a
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
kid walks up for directions like we
 
03:08:01.250 --> 03:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
explained last time it doesn't apply to
 
03:08:04.130 --> 03:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
that but if your job is you're going to
 
03:08:06.530 --> 03:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
be left one-on-one with a minor in the
 
03:08:09.290 --> 03:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
freezer of the dairy section that can't
 
03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
happen if you're going to be assigned as
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
someone's supervisor and they're a minor
 
03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
that can't happen however you could
 
03:08:17.690 --> 03:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
still work at Market Basket that's how I
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
understood this change to be
 
03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
but I think it was done that way for
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
that for that Landscaping thing where
 
03:08:27.230 --> 03:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
the boss leaves the kid with the sex
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
offender and he's now supervising that
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
sex offender and he's also one-on-one
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
with him so I think it covers it in both
 
03:08:35.809 --> 03:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
both Avenues the only other comment I
 
03:08:37.730 --> 03:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
would have is if you if if you notice
 
03:08:40.490 --> 03:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
that um we had a section one is actually
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
one continuous sentence so I think we
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
may have we may be uh setting a new
 
03:08:48.830 --> 03:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
record for the longest sentence uh in
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire RSA so
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
but I think as long as it is clear and I
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
think that's you know
 
03:09:04.439 --> 03:09:05.870 align:start position:0%
think that's you know
maybe

03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:07.370 align:start position:0%
maybe
um

03:09:07.370 --> 03:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:10.130 --> 03:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
we we do have a representative of uh of
 
03:09:12.170 --> 03:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
law enforcement who I think has a copy
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
could you give us I want to mention also
 
03:09:19.969 --> 03:09:19.979 align:start position:0%
that when yes please
 
03:09:24.050 --> 03:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.570 --> 03:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth noting also that when
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
courts look at the rsas they look at our
 
03:09:31.309 --> 03:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
discussion and the any recordings of our
 
03:09:33.769 --> 03:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
discussion so that will help
 
03:09:33.779 --> 03:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
discussion so that will help
yes

03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay and I I apologize sorry I didn't
 
03:09:40.010 --> 03:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
hear your question or
 
03:09:42.769 --> 03:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
the concern the question would be is as
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
you read you know as you read it the way
 
03:09:46.250 --> 03:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
that it's the one thing that does
 
03:09:48.889 --> 03:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
concern me with long sentences is
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's a fan of plain language
 
03:09:54.230 --> 03:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
um is do you think anybody will have any
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
trouble interpreting the statute or do
 
03:09:58.690 --> 03:09:58.700 align:start position:0%
you think that there's potential for
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of it or so
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think that excuse me by clearing up
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
what exactly they can and can't do I
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
mean this is a pretty good guideline for
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
you know School administrator guidance
 
03:10:12.230 --> 03:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
counselor coach
 
03:10:13.849 --> 03:10:13.859 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that outlines
 
03:10:13.859 --> 03:10:15.230 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that outlines
everything

03:10:15.230 --> 03:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:16.070 align:start position:0%
everything
um

03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the concerns I have
 
03:10:20.330 --> 03:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I think I talked about it a little
 
03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
bit last week and uh certainly the
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
paralegal in the office wanted me to
 
03:10:29.889 --> 03:10:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.210 --> 03:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
is this just for
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
so again we have a certain amount of
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
offenders who have not offended against
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and based on the research from Bradley I
 
03:10:47.450 --> 03:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
think it is in fact it's everyone and it
 
03:10:50.450 --> 03:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
always has been and my misunderstanding
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think the law on that is
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
changing so the existing Law whatever
 
03:10:57.650 --> 03:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
that covers this is still covering we're
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
just changing the definition to close
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that loophole for that landscaper
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
situation so I think if and that could
 
03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
be wrong
 
03:11:08.750 --> 03:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
that that part of the law already exists
 
03:11:10.250 --> 03:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
that it includes everybody and that's
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
not changing well the the part of the
 
03:11:15.230 --> 03:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
law that doesn't change says a person is
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
guilty if having been convicted of this
 
03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
or any other jurisdiction
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
in this or any other jurisdiction of any
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
felonious offense involving child sexual
 
03:11:29.630 --> 03:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
abuse images or if a felonious physical
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
assault on a minor or of any sexual
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
assault he or she blah blah blah and
 
03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:37.250 align:start position:0%
assault he or she blah blah blah and
then

03:11:37.250 --> 03:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a section two
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's or sorry section yeah section two
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty if
 
03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
um having been convicted in this or any
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction of any of the
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
offenses specified in paragraph one and
 
03:11:52.969 --> 03:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
then a person is guilty if haven't been
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
convicted on this or any other
 
03:11:54.300 --> 03:11:55.550 align:start position:0%
convicted on this or any other
jurisdiction

03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
of any of the offenses specified in
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph one so it's just I guess it
 
03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
all goes back to paragraph one and
 
03:12:04.250 --> 03:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's unchanged okay from prior law so
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would say
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
is that if we are going according to
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
03:12:13.130 --> 03:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
uh if um
 
03:12:15.530 --> 03:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
convicted in this jurisdiction or any
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction of any felonious
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
offense involving child sexual abuse
 
03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:20.630 align:start position:0%
offense involving child sexual abuse
images

03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
images
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
felonious physical assault on a minor or
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
any sexual assault
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
if I have somebody that is a sex
 
03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
offender that's committed a crime other
 
03:12:32.929 --> 03:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
than this
 
03:12:35.330 --> 03:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it looks like this doesn't
 
03:12:37.870 --> 03:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
apply so take for example
 
03:12:40.969 --> 03:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
we have a a large amount of offenders
 
03:12:45.889 --> 03:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
who are convicted under RSA 649 B4 use
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
of certain Computer Services prohibited
 
03:12:50.450 --> 03:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
these are the offenders
 
03:12:50.460 --> 03:12:51.769 align:start position:0%
these are the offenders
online

03:12:51.769 --> 03:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:12:54.170 --> 03:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
luring children to meet with them
 
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
talking with law enforcement uh you know
 
03:12:58.490 --> 03:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
when they think they're 13 year old boys
 
03:12:59.570 --> 03:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
and girls
 
03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
they could still be convicted of that
 
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't specifically say that
 
03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that's going to be in my
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
opinion would be a loophole because I
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
um written broadly
 
03:13:19.730 --> 03:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
so that law enforcement can interpret it
 
03:13:22.730 --> 03:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
and apply it without having the
 
03:13:25.730 --> 03:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
construction of specificity
 
03:13:28.010 --> 03:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
but it does say involving child sexual
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
abuse images so I feel like that's
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
really broad there and would cover that
 
03:13:34.010 --> 03:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
but but anyway the the wording that
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
wording is not changing so however it's
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
been enforced in the past would continue
 
03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be enforced the same way it's just
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
that now the things that they can't work
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
at are more
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
are covered better and I certainly see
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
that my
 
03:13:48.889 --> 03:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
my concern would be
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
that if if I'm a 47 year old male
 
03:13:55.010 --> 03:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
talking with a 13 year old female trying
 
03:13:56.330 --> 03:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
to lure her I don't send her pictures
 
03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
but we're having a conversation back and
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
forth hey meet me at
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know Chipotle it's afternoon three
 
03:14:04.030 --> 03:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock so we can have a conversation
 
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
that involves a sexual conversation
 
03:14:10.730 --> 03:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
when really they're conversing with a
 
03:14:13.370 --> 03:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
police officer I think
 
03:14:16.010 --> 03:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
a defense attorney would be able if if
 
03:14:17.809 --> 03:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
this would apply to them
 
03:14:20.330 --> 03:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
and they were rejected of employment for
 
03:14:22.130 --> 03:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
one of these things I think that
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
a skilled lawyer would be able to go
 
03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
back and say Hey look
 
03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
he didn't send any images he hasn't been
 
03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
convicted of any sexual assault
 
03:14:32.570 --> 03:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
but he's convicted of use of certain
 
03:14:34.969 --> 03:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
Computer Services
 
03:14:36.290 --> 03:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
I think he's going to fall in these
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
parameters and again I'm not I don't
 
03:14:39.170 --> 03:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
want to throw too much of a monkey
 
03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
wrench into this for you but looking at
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
it as a law enforcement capacity I think
 
03:14:45.769 --> 03:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
I think that that moving forward could
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
be a concern those um we have
 
03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh probably I'm going to go out on a
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
limb here and say
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
a good amount of our offenders are
 
03:14:59.450 --> 03:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
convicted of this crime
 
03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit into they have an assaulted
 
03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:02.690 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit into they have an assaulted
anybody

03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a sexual assault they haven't
 
03:15:07.610 --> 03:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.889 --> 03:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
but they're still convicted of a sex
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
offender crime all right I don't I don't
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
disagree with that but that's not the
 
03:15:15.050 --> 03:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill that was presented to us that's
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
current language okay so I guess and I
 
03:15:18.650 --> 03:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's something we would
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
address here in this committee to change
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
it again the current law the bill
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposed to us and that's how it's been
 
03:15:26.750 --> 03:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
as representative Bolin said that's how
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's been enforced since this since its
 
03:15:31.610 --> 03:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
Inception okay this bill is is is
 
03:15:34.510 --> 03:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
basically just changing the language
 
03:15:37.010 --> 03:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
identifying what employment you cannot
 
03:15:37.020 --> 03:15:40.490 align:start position:0%
identifying what employment you cannot
have

03:15:40.490 --> 03:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
enclosing that loophole so that that
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
current languages have a lot is today
 
03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
current languages have a lot is today
okay

03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:15:47.330 --> 03:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this is the place
 
03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
where we're going to address that part
 
03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
I mean if we're going to talk about
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
um including a whole new group of people
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
in this law I think that's really a
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
situation deserving of a public hearing
 
03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
and its own legislation because it's
 
03:16:03.290 --> 03:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
pretty complex and I wouldn't I know
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
that if it was going to affect my life I
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want for technically four folks
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
in a subcommittee to be making that
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
decision on a day when I told security I
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be parked on Park Street Long
 
03:16:14.279 --> 03:16:16.130 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be parked on Park Street Long
yes

03:16:16.130 --> 03:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:16:18.650 --> 03:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I agree and I appreciate I appreciate
 
03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
the clarification kind of bringing that
 
03:16:22.910 --> 03:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
out but of course I I think that that
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
would be better for another bill and
 
03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
would like to uh support that bill
 
03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
yeah and I don't disagree with you right
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
now I look at that and I interpret that
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
how you're interpreting it sure that
 
03:16:34.190 --> 03:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's a loophole there but we have to
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
I think we're kind of in a position here
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
where we're going to address the bill as
 
03:16:39.050 --> 03:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
presented to us with the changes they're
 
03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
looking to make and it might be a bill
 
03:16:43.610 --> 03:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
down the road that we could uh sponsor
 
03:16:46.370 --> 03:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
put together to this does clarify yeah
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
this does clarify a lot of the questions
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
we had is this um something that would
 
03:16:51.769 --> 03:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
be and you may or may not know this but
 
03:16:54.050 --> 03:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
retroactive if somebody's employed in a
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
perfect I would imagine it is so
 
03:17:04.610 --> 03:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
retroactive there's nothing about this
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that suggests that
 
03:17:07.490 --> 03:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
um unless you already had the employment
 
03:17:09.290 --> 03:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
before such and such date and I think
 
03:17:10.969 --> 03:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
that's the point of the long effective
 
03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
date is to give people
 
03:17:15.530 --> 03:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
um who are employed sorry people who are
 
03:17:18.290 --> 03:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
offenders under this law the opportunity
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be contacted by I assume your agency
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
or something to notify them of the
 
03:17:25.010 --> 03:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
changes in law around their employment
 
03:17:27.290 --> 03:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that as well okay
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
this kind of defeats the purpose if it's
 
03:17:31.010 --> 03:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
not retroactive if you have a job
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently that you're violating and you
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
do you keep it for 10 years because
 
03:17:36.650 --> 03:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
you're grandfathered in and
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I agree with that
 
03:17:38.880 --> 03:17:44.030 align:start position:0%
so I agree with that
no

03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
no also I think it's worth noting that
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said his goal was to close
 
03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
the loophole and I think we've
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
accomplished that with the wording and
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know you're always free to approach
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
any lawmakers particularly on this
 
03:17:56.570 --> 03:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
committee with um your proposal you know
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
we can file bills and like um I want to
 
03:18:02.929 --> 03:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
I do have a question about the we took
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
the background check out of this
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
build so that isn't part of the law
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
however and correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions in place already
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
because I know that I and uh just a
 
03:18:17.210 --> 03:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
little bit about my experience I've been
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement for 30 years and I
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
know that I've done fingerprint
 
03:18:22.330 --> 03:18:22.340 align:start position:0%
applications for school teachers in town
 
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh for their employment so there are
 
03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
teachers and councils that have to get
 
03:18:30.230 --> 03:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted do you do you know what
 
03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
that provision is is it a separate law
 
03:18:34.730 --> 03:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
is it is it administrative
 
03:18:37.370 --> 03:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
sorry I wish I knew I I honestly I don't
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's something in place I I
 
03:18:45.410 --> 03:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
just I don't know all right thank you
 
03:18:46.969 --> 03:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
and I think that that question about
 
03:18:49.210 --> 03:18:49.220 align:start position:0%
this that being part of the law would
 
03:18:51.410 --> 03:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
overburden not only the state with
 
03:18:53.570 --> 03:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
background checks but also
 
03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
employers if it would you know they
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
would have to conduct these background
 
03:18:58.490 --> 03:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
checks if they want to hire five people
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
that could take months before they get
 
03:19:02.090 --> 03:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
one in the door so but that's been
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
removed okay uh so it's it's basically
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
back to the original Law
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
with the expanded definition of what
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
kind of employment you can have that
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
close to loopholes which are definitely
 
03:19:16.250 --> 03:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
it definitely adds quite a bit
 
03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.130 --> 03:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions of uh this
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think you know moving forward it my
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
office is uh
 
03:19:44.090 --> 03:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know we do a lot of work in there we
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
work a lot of different agencies I get
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
multiple calls a day on enforcement
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
issues and I just uh
 
03:19:52.730 --> 03:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
I see that being the one you know a
 
03:19:54.889 --> 03:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
couple of people picked up on it right
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
off the bat and said well wait a minute
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be a problem and that's
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
the current law so it is correct you're
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
right but it is but
 
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I would be interested to know
 
03:20:07.969 --> 03:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
you know in the time period that we have
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
between today and when legislators can
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
file more legislation if you do end up
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
reaching out to a rep and asking them to
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
file something I think this committee
 
03:20:18.830 --> 03:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
would want to know if there are people
 
03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
um who are on the registry who do work
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
potentially in the capacity described in
 
03:20:26.450 --> 03:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
um that are that were permitted to under
 
03:20:28.500 --> 03:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
um that are that were permitted to under
the

03:20:30.230 --> 03:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
um sorry not under this legislation I'd
 
03:20:33.050 --> 03:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
be interested to know if there are
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
people who
 
03:20:37.969 --> 03:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
are convicted uh sex offenders who don't
 
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
meet the description in the existing law
 
03:20:43.550 --> 03:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
pre these changes who have been working
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
um in positions that you know
 
03:20:48.769 --> 03:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
um are described in the existing law so
 
03:20:51.309 --> 03:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
like are there people with a computer
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
activities whatever conviction that
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you're aware of their employment
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
and it does involve children and then
 
03:20:57.899 --> 03:20:59.570 align:start position:0%
and it does involve children and then
additionally

03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
um would be interested to know if there
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
are any other
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
descriptors or convictions that you
 
03:21:07.130 --> 03:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
think should be included and also
 
03:21:07.140 --> 03:21:10.730 align:start position:0%
think should be included and also
um

03:21:10.730 --> 03:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.090 --> 03:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe that's it just just an
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
FYI for when you're you know because
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're gonna want to know those I imagine
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
if there's a bill like that it would be
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we would do it when
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we take registrations from
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
offenders we obviously have them
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
um tell us you know where they work all
 
03:21:36.290 --> 03:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
online identifiers employment anything
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
that changes with them they're required
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
by law to come in and let us know that
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a status update new job
 
03:21:45.650 --> 03:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
things like that but occasionally take
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
phone calls for example we took a phone
 
03:21:50.230 --> 03:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
call last week
 
03:21:52.610 --> 03:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
about three weeks ago notifying of us
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
and I won't say which restaurant but a
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
fairly large chain restaurant relocated
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
a female offender from Florida to New
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be the
 
03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
um general manager of a restaurant where
 
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
she's going to supervise obviously
 
03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:10.309 align:start position:0%
she's going to supervise obviously
everybody

03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know in looking into it a lot of the
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
hostesses and hosts are you know 16 17
 
03:22:18.170 --> 03:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
years old so
 
03:22:20.090 --> 03:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
03:22:22.130 --> 03:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know siding with one person or
 
03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
another but that's that's gonna
 
03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
end her career with that restaurant and
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
obviously people make decisions early on
 
03:22:31.190 --> 03:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
in life and you know that's what she's
 
03:22:32.690 --> 03:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
got to live with but these are the
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
things that I'm sure my office is going
 
03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
to get phone calls if if and when this
 
03:22:39.290 --> 03:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
passes Hey listen this is my situation I
 
03:22:41.450 --> 03:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
just got terminated according to the law
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
so these are the things that and I don't
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
know her specific story I just know
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
that that happened so
 
03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
um to your point I don't know I could it
 
03:22:53.570 --> 03:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
would be tough to put together a
 
03:22:55.370 --> 03:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to say hey we have
 
03:22:57.170 --> 03:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know out of the 3000 offenders we
 
03:22:57.180 --> 03:22:58.010 align:start position:0%
you know out of the 3000 offenders we
have

03:22:58.010 --> 03:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
300 of them that were supervising
 
03:23:01.849 --> 03:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
children and
 
03:23:03.290 --> 03:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
and then we would have to look and see
 
03:23:05.330 --> 03:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
okay what were their offenses you know
 
03:23:06.769 --> 03:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
are there a registered sex offender yes
 
03:23:09.889 --> 03:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
they are but maybe it was uh
 
03:23:12.170 --> 03:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
something not outlined here or something
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
different so these are things we would
 
03:23:15.889 --> 03:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
have to put together and
 
03:23:18.530 --> 03:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
not sure we would have the staffer
 
03:23:20.809 --> 03:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
you know to be able to do that I don't
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
know if that answers your question but
 
03:23:25.130 --> 03:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I think if you can tell us like we
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
know that roughly this many people are
 
03:23:29.690 --> 03:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
potentially involved in supervisory
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
positions but we have no idea at any
 
03:23:33.650 --> 03:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
given point who their co-workers are
 
03:23:35.570 --> 03:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
um that would be at least helpful and
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
apparently um RSA 170-e colon 4
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe that's the wrong one the
 
03:23:45.610 --> 03:23:45.620 align:start position:0%
background checks are required for
 
03:23:48.410 --> 03:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
daycare providers already
 
03:23:55.610 --> 03:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.620 --> 03:24:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:24:08.510 --> 03:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
right I don't know
 
03:24:10.439 --> 03:24:12.050 align:start position:0%
right I don't know
um

03:24:12.050 --> 03:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.020 --> 03:24:32.889 align:start position:0%
 
fully

03:24:32.889 --> 03:24:32.899 align:start position:0%
fully
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
so one other question and I'll leave you
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
would there be some Provisions uh in
 
03:25:22.010 --> 03:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
this law that I just don't see for
 
03:25:22.020 --> 03:25:22.849 align:start position:0%
this law that I just don't see for
example

03:25:22.849 --> 03:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:25:22.859 --> 03:25:23.389 align:start position:0%
example
um

03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:26.809 --> 03:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
so if you have an offender
 
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
that works
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
in the Food Service somewhere
 
03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
who doesn't supervise miners
 
03:25:41.090 --> 03:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
and the supervisor that day calls in
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
sick so this soup this offender
 
03:25:45.410 --> 03:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
is now training
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
new hires and is their supervisor for
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
that day I know that's a stretch but it
 
03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
happens so does that
 
03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
do they fit into one of these categories
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think I think I don't think it
 
03:26:01.190 --> 03:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
is a stretch I think that the the way
 
03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
that the bill is written it would
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
require an employee to be open with
 
03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
their employer and communicative to make
 
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure that if that employer wants to
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
employ a sex offender that they're
 
03:26:13.610 --> 03:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
cautious about what they direct them to
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
do and I would want that you know yeah I
 
03:26:17.929 --> 03:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
think and just the supervising that
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
person they're also one-on-one with that
 
03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
person potentially which which is
 
03:26:23.570 --> 03:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
another section of this so I think
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's the loophole that we're looking
 
03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:26.090 align:start position:0%
that's the loophole that we're looking
to

03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
close and it's on that person to notify
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
the employer I think like you know in my
 
03:26:34.490 --> 03:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
job I you know I work as a homeless
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
Advocate which means that I'm kind of
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
the one person who's directly
 
03:26:40.010 --> 03:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
supervising in you know being in the
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
office and
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and it's mostly single moms and so my
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
dad who is the executive director of the
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
shelter still won't be there for an
 
03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
overnight shift or be the person who's
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
there because just inherently because
 
03:26:52.729 --> 03:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
he's a man and he cannot be in
 
03:26:54.650 --> 03:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
situations like that where there could
 
03:26:55.969 --> 03:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
be any type of liability or anything
 
03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
like that best guy assault of the Earth
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
but he still you know can't be in that
 
03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
position in the same way when you're
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
hiring uh somebody knowing that they're
 
03:27:04.370 --> 03:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
in the situation you provide for that
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you I found
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate blurb the committee report
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
from 2022
 
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
I Can't Believe It's Not 2022 anymore
 
03:27:21.229 --> 03:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
um and it just said
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
although the issue is worthy of
 
03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
consideration the language is in need of
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
further review before it can be
 
03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
implemented so I mean we did that
 
03:27:31.849 --> 03:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
so do we vote I don't remember how
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee works anymore
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think we do I think so we someone will
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
make a motion to adopt this amendment
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
and if it's a DOT adopted maybe we make
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
a motion to whether we OTP or ideal it
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
or as our recommendation to the
 
03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
or as our recommendation to the
committee

03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
I think and I don't know if
 
03:27:50.450 --> 03:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative news is wordsmithing some
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
more it looks like you might be trying
 
03:27:51.479 --> 03:27:53.830 align:start position:0%
more it looks like you might be trying
yeah

03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.570 --> 03:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking to see if there was any
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
kind of an interim study report okay
 
03:28:00.650 --> 03:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
usually I can find them if there are if
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're there but I couldn't find one
 
03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:03.290 align:start position:0%
they're there but I couldn't find one
here

03:28:03.290 --> 03:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:05.929 --> 03:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
so um and that's that's one of the
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
issues when we refer stuff to interim
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
study sometimes things get studied
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're they're not really
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
prioritized for study and they fall off
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
the map and it's hard to know what
 
03:28:16.610 --> 03:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
happened so they were never actually
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
studied they were just set up for study
 
03:28:22.690 --> 03:28:22.700 align:start position:0%
okay with that in mind though I will uh
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
move uh Amendment
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
2023-05 86 H
 
03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:30.349 align:start position:0%
2023-05 86 H
um

03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh with a recommendation of ought to
 
03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
pass on HB 107 FN
 
03:28:43.969 --> 03:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we'll take a vote and
 
03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:49.309 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we'll take a vote and
uh

03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.670 --> 03:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
I am a yes representative Muse
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newell yes and
 
03:28:57.710 --> 03:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative bouldin
 
03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:00.229 align:start position:0%
representative bouldin
aye

03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.239 --> 03:29:01.849 align:start position:0%
 
aye

03:29:01.849 --> 03:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
aye
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm new to this too so that I
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a form that I didn't
 
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
have last time that I'm filling out now
 
03:29:07.200 --> 03:29:08.389 align:start position:0%
have last time that I'm filling out now
um

03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:10.910 --> 03:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I guess just a
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a point of order here so once
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've adopted these this amendment or
 
03:29:16.729 --> 03:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
have we already do we need to vote
 
03:29:19.070 --> 03:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
further to recommend the committee or is
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that suffice what we've done technically
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
technically amendments don't require
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
formal votes or roll call votes even in
 
03:29:30.410 --> 03:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
full Committee in a regular exact
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
session they can be agreed to by a Voice
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
vote informally and they and the
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
agreement doesn't even need to be
 
03:29:39.170 --> 03:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
recorded until you record the final
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
notion of Ops as amended so the fact
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
that we all agree to it and then did a
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
Voice vote I think is and then of course
 
03:29:47.330 --> 03:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Muse said ought to pass
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
in his motion okay so I think that there
 
03:29:50.929 --> 03:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
are separate sections on here that's why
 
03:29:52.429 --> 03:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering we've I think we've
 
03:29:56.330 --> 03:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
completed the voting process
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
if we were recommending if we were going
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
to recommend itl we wouldn't even have
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
them take up the amendment in in the
 
03:30:06.000 --> 03:30:07.010 align:start position:0%
them take up the amendment in in the
committee

03:30:07.010 --> 03:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:30:08.990 --> 03:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
all right so I've
 
03:30:11.570 --> 03:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
we are finished here uh I guess we'll
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
adjourn this meeting unless anyone has
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
03:30:16.610 --> 03:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
03:30:18.650 --> 03:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
we'll close the uh subcommittee session
