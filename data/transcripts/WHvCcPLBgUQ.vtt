spill 64 and I called representative
 
00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.369 align:start position:0%
spill 64 and I called representative
Gallagher

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:34.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
um just for the record
 
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh I'm
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Gallagher from
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
conquered Ward 6 which is Merrimack
 
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
County District 20. I am here to
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
64 and act requiring the commission on
 
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
demographic transit to consider data on
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity for the purpose of
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
increasing racial and ethnic diversity
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.449 align:start position:0%
so um
yeah

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
my way of introducing this is going to
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
be a little bit roundabout but bear with
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
me so
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
was born here in Concord grew up in
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
Concord and one of the things I've
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
really loved about living in New
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is our first in the nation
 
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.730 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is our first in the nation
primary

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.330 align:start position:0%
primary
um

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
our high school
 
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
our high school
uh

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
we had a teacher Joanne McGlynn who
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
would have that ran this presidential
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
candidates Club where
 
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.550 align:start position:0%
candidates Club where
um

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
we would organize events where the
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
different presidential candidates from
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
both parties would come and speak at
 
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
the high school and that was really a
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
formative experience for me
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
um politically and part of the reason
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
why I'm here today
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and so you may remember for example
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
John McCain
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
calling me a little jerk during one of
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
his events like um wrote my college
 
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
application essay on that defending his
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
right to call me one because I was being
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
a little jerk but um
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so and that got me into George
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
Washington University so but now that
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
I've returned to New Hampshire
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
one thing that's changed is that
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
um our first in the nation primary is
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
under attack and one of the common
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
arguments that is used
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
against us having the first in the
 
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
nation primary is that we are not
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
diverse enough
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we do not have a set of
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
demographics that are representative of
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
those of the nation at Large
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
the thing is when people bring up that
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
point I don't really have a good
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
comeback to it like
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know they're right I I agree with
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
them that
 
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
them that
um

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
that this gate with the first in the
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
nation primary
 
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.570 align:start position:0%
nation primary
should

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
have demographics that are
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative of those of the of the
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
nation at large where I diverge from the
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
other people making this argument though
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
is that instead of then
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
giving up and saying okay so therefore
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should no longer go first
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
I instead conclude well then therefore
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should become
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
that state with the representative
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
demographics of the nation that
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
deserves to go first
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I spent some time
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
thinking about how to do that
 
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.010 align:start position:0%
thinking about how to do that
um

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
I first considered a
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
study committee but then thought instead
 
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.570 align:start position:0%
study committee but then thought instead
of

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
trying some instead of creating
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
something new that it would be better to
 
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.050 align:start position:0%
something new that it would be better to
um

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.730 align:start position:0%
um
just

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
do something with a body that already
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
exists so at first
 
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.189 align:start position:0%
exists so at first
um

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
at first I was going to
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
um so the governor has established his
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
or well had established I don't know if
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
it still exists his own personal
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion Council
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
um so I was thinking of possibly
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
creating a statutory basis for that
 
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
creating a statutory basis for that
um but

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:52.550 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.309 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
that would have been more difficult than
 
00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.650 align:start position:0%
that would have been more difficult than
um

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
then I had the appetite to pursue at the
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
time so instead I discovered that we
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a commission on demographic Trends
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
already which kind of
 
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
are already deals with the
 
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
are already deals with the
um

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
topic of demographics so I just looked
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
at the statute establishing it and
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
decided to add a sentence
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
to it just adding to their duties of the
 
00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
advice that they provide
 
00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:32.930 align:start position:0%
advice that they provide
um

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
so I actually filed this bill last year
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
too but due to a scheduling mishap I
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
did not I I did not introduce it um
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
which led to it being killed and one of
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
the reasons it died apparently was
 
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.870 align:start position:0%
the reasons it died apparently was
because

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
the commission on demographic Trends had
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
been eliminated in The
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
state budget so it was trying to amend a
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
statute that didn't exist well later
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
that term we passed another bill to
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
reestablish the commission on
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends so now it exists
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
again so now
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
list the statute that we're modifying
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
should actually exist this time around
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
so it should actually work
 
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.269 align:start position:0%
so it should actually work
um

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
so just
 
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:28.670 align:start position:0%
so just
um

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
to address some points
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
about it that might come up
 
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
about it that might come up
um

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
so it's worded neutrally it doesn't
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
mention any specific race or ethnicity
 
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.949 align:start position:0%
mention any specific race or ethnicity
if

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
somehow we were
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
to if if our racial and ethnic makeups
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
somehow were inverted it would the
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
increasing diversity would mean moving
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
in the other direction
 
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.670 align:start position:0%
in the other direction
um

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.290 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
all of the things that um
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
the commission does are
 
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.130 align:start position:0%
the commission does are
advisory

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.610 align:start position:0%
um so
if

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:18.740 align:start position:0%
if people decide that they don't like
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
the commission's advice they're free to
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
ignore it although I don't think that
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
they should because I um I think they
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
generally give good advice
 
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
generally give good advice
um

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's just
 
00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.210 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's just
um

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's a commission that already meets um
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
they um so and for
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
for disclosure's sake my father actually
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
sits on this commission but he doesn't
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
gain anything
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
from this legislation though besides
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
extra work so I don't really think that
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
makes it a conflict of
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
um interest or anything
 
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.590 align:start position:0%
um interest or anything
um

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.970 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
it's a good commission that um and I
 
00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.710 align:start position:0%
it's a good commission that um and I
think

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would just help us to
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
signal to the rest of the country that
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
we take their critiques of our lack of
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
diversity seriously and are attempting
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
to do something about it now you could
 
00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
to do something about it now you could
argue

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
argue
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
the dnc's already
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
voted to
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
take away our primary from us but
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not ready to give up that
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
quickly I think it's still worthwhile
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
making the best possible
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
case that we can
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
you know because it's going to go
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
further the secretary of state is
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
required to schedule our primary first
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
so he's going to do that and then the
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
next debate will be whether the DNC
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
takes our delegates away or not and I
 
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.290 align:start position:0%
takes our delegates away or not and I
think

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.730 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful in the
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
debate over whether our delegates get
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
taken away or not
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
to be able to refute
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
the point about us not liking diversity
 
00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
the point about us not liking diversity
here

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.810 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um this this bill was something I
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
came up with on my own it wasn't
 
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.380 align:start position:0%
something that they asked for
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
specifically so I don't think
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
this should be seen as
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
caving to their demands or anything I
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
think it should just be
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
seeing as
 
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.910 align:start position:0%
seeing as
um

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:40.700 align:start position:0%
taking points that have been made
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
seriously and attempting to do something
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
about them so
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
that is my
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and I will take
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
questions now
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
you representative Gallery are there
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
questions representative O'Brien
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
question and just briefly looking at
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
this and listening to some of your
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
comments uh you were talking
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I have a keen interest in it too in
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
the primary and you know I'm very proud
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
being a New Hampshire person have the
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
person the nation primary and would like
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
to keep such but let's focus on the bill
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
at hand right before us and I'm looking
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
at it and in the title edge of the
 
00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:31.459 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
it's you're basically repeating
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
what is in the title age so my down home
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
right to the bullseye type of question
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
what do you see is the real need of
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
change here what does that the
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
commission isn't always doing and going
 
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:53.660 align:start position:0%
by your initial remarks which
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
in your first sentence is what it should
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
be doing anyways aren't we already doing
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
it is the question
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
well all right so there's two parts to
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
that there uh that I'm going to address
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
separately one is the title I do agree
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
that the title is rather long and
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
basically just
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
says the same
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
um text as the bill itself
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah OLS
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
created that title and I would be open
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
to an amendment to shorten it um as long
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
as it retains the same basic
 
00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.810 align:start position:0%
as it retains the same basic
um

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:31.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
meaning of it
 
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.910 align:start position:0%
meaning of it
um

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
and as for
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah the part about my remarks not
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
actually being reflected in the bill so
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah um my initial draft of it um
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
did include language specifically
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
mentioning the first in the Nation
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
primary but that just um
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't make it into the final
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
draft OLS didn't think it was necessary
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
so you can put that back if you think
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.509 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
um

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then so as far as um
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the commission
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
is already doing so they're actually
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
when the demographics they're mostly
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
looking at currently have to do with age
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're mostly looking at um
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
back in back in 2018 you heard a lot
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
more about this
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
um about our silver tsunami of
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
um our aging population of not having
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
enough young people to take care of our
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
older residents so that's primarily what
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
they're looking at currently
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I think just having a little
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
bit of um
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
extra specificity
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
could just help nudge things in the
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
right direction here
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan yes thank you thank
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
you representative Gallagher uh
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
we have over 400 Commissions in the
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
state right now where a good portion of
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
them never meet
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
there is a move a foot to try to trim
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
that down and eliminate them make
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
government much more efficient this I
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you this is this one is a
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
candidate to be eliminated uh what are
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
your thoughts about that
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
I have seen the schedule and seeing how
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
there is a bill to
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
um eliminate the commission entirely
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
scheduled immediately after this one
 
00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:45.949 align:start position:0%
scheduled immediately after this one
um

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I will try to limit my remarks
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill at hand now um and I'm going
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
I am going to be uh sticking around
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
longer so um yeah I do plan to testify
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
on the next bill too but um as far as
 
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:06.260 align:start position:0%
whether this Commission
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
as far as this commission it this this
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
is not one of the commissions that
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't ever meet it does actually meet
 
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't ever meet it does actually meet
um

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
I I think it's monthly if it's not
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
monthly it's bi-monthly
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
um but yeah there's there's members of
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
both parties
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
um on it I think Senator Hennessey
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
um was the person running it previously
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I I think
 
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.330 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I I think
that

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:35.930 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for testifying today and
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious on the
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
reason for doing this is that the goal
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
is to increase New Hampshire's ethnic
 
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
diversity according to the testimony
 
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
we've received today
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
How would how by collecting data are you
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
going to increase
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's ethnic diversity
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
and once the state has data like this
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
what do you think that the state can do
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
with this Beyond this there's there's
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
obviously a goal Beyond this based on
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading here thank you yeah so
 
00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:26.510 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading here thank you yeah so
well

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
the thing yeah we do in fact have some
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
existing pockets of diversity
 
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.409 align:start position:0%
existing pockets of diversity
um

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
in our state currently like on in
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
Concord it's more out on the heights
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um where is where a lot of
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
new um
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
refugees are settled um and I like in
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
Nashua for example
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I think they have like one of our few
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
majority minority house districts
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the state
um

00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
um taking a look at
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
where are
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
existing pockets of diversity are and
 
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:15.980 align:start position:0%
what causes them to be more diverse
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
could be helpful
 
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.930 align:start position:0%
could be helpful
and

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.669 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
applying those lessons to um other areas
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the state that
 
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.870 align:start position:0%
of the state that
um

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
might want to
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
so my initial feeling on this is I don't
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
really trust government and I know that
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
during World War II the U.S government
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
used census data to round up the
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
Japanese so I'm just curious what your
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
concerns are have you thought about
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
maybe this data being used for purposes
 
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
maybe this data being used for purposes
unintended

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.669 align:start position:0%
unintended
um

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
I mean I think data is data I would
 
00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:06.770 align:start position:0%
I mean I think data is data I would
oppose

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
the use of internment as I I would not
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
see that as meeting the spirit of this
 
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.330 align:start position:0%
see that as meeting the spirit of this
bill

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah um
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would
 
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would
be

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:20.900 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
illegal if whether the fed the feds
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
would probably come after us if we tried
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing something like that fans did do it
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
yeah well let's we're getting really far
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
afield from the topic of the bill so I'd
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to concentrate on that are
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
there any other questions relative to
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
the bill representative Bailey and then
 
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.350 align:start position:0%
the bill representative Bailey and then
Gould

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be simpler and cheaper if we
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
just identified as being more diverse
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
than we are
 
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.530 align:start position:0%
than we are
represented

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:56.540 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
represented
[Laughter]

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
perfect question representative cooler
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
do you think the Census Data is accurate
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
for diversity in New Hampshire is it
 
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.909 align:start position:0%
for diversity in New Hampshire is it
exists

00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
do not believe
 
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.870 align:start position:0%
do not believe
um

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think I'm qualified to
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
answer that question at the moment
 
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.230 align:start position:0%
answer that question at the moment
um

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I can
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
I can look into it and get back to you
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
about that thank you thank you follow up
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gallagher for
 
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question and for being willing
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
to look into it I think that um that's
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
something that do you think that's
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
something the commission could focus on
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
is how accurately our census data does
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
or does not reflect the diversity in New
 
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.649 align:start position:0%
or does not reflect the diversity in New
Hampshire

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:21:57.659 --> 00:22:00.049 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
yes that is something that it could
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
look into
 
00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
look into
um

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just say about that
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative uh Earhart thank you
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm under the impression that you
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
believe that diversity in these
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods is a good thing and it's
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
good for the state
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes I do how what metric
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
are you using to determine that
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up please well what so my point
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
being is in these areas in let's say
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Nashua or Concord where
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
it's very diverse what metrics can you
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
point to that say that this is good for
 
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
the State Community Etc
 
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.049 align:start position:0%
the State Community Etc
um

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
mostly subjective ones
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
just as a person I like being around
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
diversity and I know a lot of my
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
neighbors do too but I don't have any
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
hard data specifically and I think
 
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.190 align:start position:0%
hard data specifically and I think
that

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm not really
 
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm not really
sure

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
what metric would be appropriate
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm kind of afraid that if
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
certain metrics
 
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.330 align:start position:0%
certain metrics
um

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
if we tried using
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
um certain metrics here that they could
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
be misused so
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
I think he's answered your question if
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
you don't mind
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
are there any uh relevant questions for
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.289 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
he said he that the his criteria are
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
subjective and I think that answers your
 
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.289 align:start position:0%
subjective and I think that answers your
question

00:23:53.289 --> 00:23:53.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:07.789 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm a co-sponsor of the bit of
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact I was in the Eda when
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
resident Gallagher's first version of
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
the bill last year came through and it
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
kind of uh fell victim to a bunch of
 
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
access including the fact that uh
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst I think even the members of
 
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
the committee the committee the
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
commission had been accidentally deleted
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
during the Budget Trailer Bill process
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
while they're renaming uh
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
what is it called the Department of
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
Business and economic they were like
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
renaming what used to be known as dread
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
they gave it a more name and but anyway
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
um for and I put in a pink car for the
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
next bill so I don't want to go on the
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
top of that bill except to say I think
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a good commission it's a
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
valuable one and it's it's I supported
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
it being revived uh last year in fact it
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
kept meeting even after they uh they
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
officially abolished it um
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill as a Revenant
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher app we pointed out it's cost
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
nothing and I think it should be doing
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
it anyway which is considering racial
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
and ethnic data and I think the goal of
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
increasing New Hampshire ethnic
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
diversity is a good one um
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
first of all I'll say we're the
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
discovered yet we're the second oldest
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
state in the Union we have an average
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
age of 43.1 when the 2020 census was
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
taken we're just ahead of Vermont which
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
is 43.0 just
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
well Maine is even older than us 45.0 so
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
and main seal just stated so the three
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
north of New England were the oldest
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
region of the country so it's not
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
Florida it's not anywhere else it's you
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
know it's not
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's not the Great Plain State
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's us um and I think that's
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
and we're also one of the less diverse
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
states in the union we're not quite as
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
white as some people believe we are we
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
had got off on
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
change both reversion Nation primary and
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I my personal feeling is in spite of
 
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:00.140 align:start position:0%
what was going on uh with the DNC
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
secretary scandalin will be scheduling
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire primary for some time
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
probably in January um certainly I'll be
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
voting represent Gallagher I'm should be
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
voting and
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
I haven't decided which candidates
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
support but I'm I would I'm not ever I
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
might just representative Morgan about
 
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
the Bill yes okay so to keep our economy
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
growing we need to bring in more
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
ambitious young working people in the
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
state as our governor said at the budget
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
address a couple days ago
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that means we're going to bring them
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
in from other states or even other
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
countries and younger working adults in
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
general are more ethnically diverse than
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
older Generations just because there's a
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
more people are there's more interracial
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
relationships people are more tolerant
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
of them than older Generations might
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
have been in the places they come from
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
are going to be much more diverse in New
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and even uh you know white
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
well I wasn't actually born in New
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was born in Indiana but even
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know white people like me prefer to
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
stay in a place where anybody of any
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
color is welcome we don't want to be
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
around a place
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be kind of boring to be
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
around you know have to live in a place
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
where everybody was looked like me I
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
like having a variety of people there
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
and we've been having a lot of trouble
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
encouraging our young people of any
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
color to stay
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
here we're like we're net exporter of
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
college students for example so more
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
diversity I think that would make New
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more attractively for
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
ambitious young people to uh says my
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
pursue their dreams or uh of course
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's also the stay work and play
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
initiatives that's another phrase I
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
could use to stay work and play in New
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so please vote not to pass on
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
HP 64 to keep uh to make New Hampshire
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
more more vibrant more more diverse
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
state with a more you know with a
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
stronger economy and a stronger you know
 
00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:50.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:00.020 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that the
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
Commission on demo demographic Trends
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't consider race and
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
ethnicity now well that's uh is that
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
what this is that what you're saying I'm
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
just I'm just affirming that they that
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
they should be I I'm not familiar with
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
it as representing Gallagher is my look
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
at the minutes of some of the meetings
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
yet they I mean they have been
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
considering it and certainly uh there's
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
data not just in the decennial census
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
but in the surveys the Census Bureau
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
takes every year there's other data and
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
they it's just they already are
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
considering it but this just like
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
encourages them to consider it even more
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up see what I'm trying to figure
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
out is what's broken that you're trying
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
um well we are happy
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
we are having trouble uh our con one
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
thing's just stifling our economies is a
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
shortage of uh you know young young
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
people who are raising families who are
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
at the prime of their career and um one
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the things
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
I mean there's many things that are uh
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
discouraging people from moving here
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
from elsewhere and discouraging young
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
people staying at saying part of it
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
maybe is the perception that we're very
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
white and white bread type of state and
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think also the younger generation is
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
it wants to be around diverse people you
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
know they don't even though
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
even though like white supremacist
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
groups get a disproportionate amount of
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
attention most people are in New
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the USA are very
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
tolerant and want to live in a tolerant
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
place and also say like your community
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
in Rochester for example and Resident
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
O'Brien's those are
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
to places that are doing a lot to drive
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
the growth of our of our state not just
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
within their own City Limits but you
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
know Statewide and those are also two
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
relatively diverse diverse places and
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
getting more diverse so
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I didn't get my
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
question answered oh sorry well I'm sure
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
very good are there any other questions
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
chair I know time is nice so I'll be
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
struck to the point representative
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
Oregon 45 seconds uh taking my question
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
I see you kicking the ball for a very
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
good goal yeah okay but I don't see the
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
follow through and the thing is I agree
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
in like her question collecting data and
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
everything else but in the example and I
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank representative
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
Gallagher for recognizing what the good
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
people and the citizens of Nashua have
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
done Workforce housing other different
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
things I mean maybe this commission is
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
okay maybe we should channel into
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
something else I mean is a problem with
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
the bill is it the data collection or is
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
there other issues well it's just a very
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
simple bill which costs nothing and so I
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
certainly agree
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
you know all the data is useless unless
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
we're following through on it but that's
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
a matter for other bills in other
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
communities this is just a small step
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on House
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Gerald Griffin
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
and I represent Hillsborough 42.
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
consisting in the towns of Mount Vernon
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
linebro and New Boston
 
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:22.820 align:start position:0%
I'm the sponsor of HB 228
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
HB 228 repeals a section of RSA 12
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
and by doing so eliminates the
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
commission on demographics
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
the current Commission on demographics
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
was created last year
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
by HB 1106.
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
that same bill
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
eliminated the previous Commission on
 
00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
eliminated the previous Commission on
demographics

00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
to put
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
hb228 in perspective
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
it is helpful to look at the history of
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
the earlier Commission
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
and with the chair's permission I will
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
I believe the initial commission was
 
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:07.220 align:start position:0%
created in
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
2016 and arose from an earliest study
 
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.330 align:start position:0%
2016 and arose from an earliest study
group

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
recommended that the State hire a
 
00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:18.110 align:start position:0%
recommended that the State hire a
demographer

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
then then representative Hennessy latest
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
he was a sponsor of the initial bill
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
she later became the chair of the
 
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.810 align:start position:0%
she later became the chair of the
committee

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
that initial bill called for the
 
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:39.140 align:start position:0%
commission to support a newly created
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
demographer position
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
and consider any legislation that might
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
arise as a result of that support
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the demographer position was created but
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge it has never been filled
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
and so from its outset one might say
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
the initial commission was a commission
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
without a mission
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
now back to HB 228
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
there are four reasons I put the bill
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
forward and I'd like to outline those
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
first it is a commission with a vague
 
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:17.750 align:start position:0%
first it is a commission with a vague
mission

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying law says in part
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
the commission will create a biennial
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
scorecard on New Hampshire's demographic
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
suggests to me
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
that we measure against some objective
 
00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:36.050 align:start position:0%
that we measure against some objective
standard

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
but the law is silent on what that
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
standard is
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.109 align:start position:0%
standard is
secondly

00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
the commission is a duplication of
 
00:34:44.339 --> 00:34:45.470 align:start position:0%
the commission is a duplication of
ethics

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.089 align:start position:0%

Andrew Johnson and his team over at unh
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
study demographics and death
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
and produce excellent reports
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
at one of our recent Finance hearings
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
I asked Peter Caswell the director of
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Business and economic
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
Affairs if his Department used those
 
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.190 align:start position:0%
Affairs if his Department used those
reports

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
he indicated they didn't they did in
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
fact use those reports and use UNH as a
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
resource on demographics
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
those of us who serve in finance and
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
spend several days at the beginning of
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
each biennium getting up to date on the
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy the housing market
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
the real estate market and of course the
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
changing demographics of our state
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
this last month Professor Johnson
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
delivered his report
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
and it was very detailed and very well
 
00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
and it was very detailed and very well
done

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
third the underlying laws deficient in
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
several respects
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
the law is vague about its mission
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
the law calls for membership as follows
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
for house members one Senator the
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of Business
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs or his steps in
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
need and six members from the public
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's 12 total members
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
with seven members constituting a quorum
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
during the time I served on the earlier
 
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.130 align:start position:0%
during the time I served on the earlier
Commission

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
the most public members we ever had was
 
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.870 align:start position:0%
the most public members we ever had was
two

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
both of whom were excellent and brought
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
much to the table
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
but we started with a deficit of four
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
public members which did not leave much
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
room for error
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
in fact as the first named House member
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the new Commission I call the
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting of that of that
 
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.930 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting of that of that
Commission

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
to elect a chair
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
only three members showed up
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
and without a quorum I recess the
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
meaning until such date as a quorum
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
could be found
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
that date has not yet arrived
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
finally for All Above reasons
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
this commission is a squandering of
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
valuable resources that should not be
 
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.589 align:start position:0%
valuable resources that should not be
spent

00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
in the duplication of work that is being
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
done so well by our own unh
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
we only have 24 senators and we know
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
each one of them as stretched very very
 
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.890 align:start position:0%
each one of them as stretched very very
thin

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
thin
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
I know the speaker's office is often
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
challenged to fill the many positions
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
resulting from the many some say too
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
many some say way too many commissions
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
and study groups we have created
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
finally we are fortunate to have
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
citizens who are willing to help and
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
contribute their time
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
but we must ensure that we ask them to
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
serve in a meaningful way
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that we don't squander their
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
and that we don't squander their
participation

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
I know they are a squares resource
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
because during my service on both the
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
prior commission and the current one we
 
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:20.420 align:start position:0%
never had more than two public members
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
despite in the case of Alaska Mission my
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
repeated requests and emails to fill the
 
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
repeated requests and emails to fill the
vacancies

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
we heard previous testimony just before
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
yours that uh the work on these
 
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
yours that uh the work on these
commissions

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
is free that doesn't cost anything uh
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
especially in light of mileage to be
 
00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
especially in light of mileage to be
paid

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
people from state government to fulfill
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh clerks to publish
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
the uh the minutes and the the notes do
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
you agree that that these don't cost
 
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.329 align:start position:0%
you agree that that these don't cost
anything

00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
No in fact that's why I'm here these
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
commissions are very expensive and in
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the number of house members
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
a senator and the general public so we
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
should be very very careful how we spend
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
those those people who basically
 
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
those those people who basically
volunteer

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
that time we should be very careful how
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.849 --> 00:39:39.859 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
you're representative brother
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make make sure I
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
understood what you said so that the the
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
commission on demographics hasn't really
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
been as a result of the legislation that
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
was passed recently has not met is that
 
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.210 align:start position:0%
was passed recently has not met is that
correct

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't let me speak a little
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
bit louder
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that I
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
understood what you said in your
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
testimony that the Democrat the um
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
Commission on demographics that was
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
originally that was set up in the most
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
recent legislation has not met is that
 
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:16.130 align:start position:0%
recent legislation has not met is that
correct

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
it I did call the organizational meeting
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the most recent legislation
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
and uh as I said three people showed up
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
three people is not a quorum
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
so I recessed the meeting until such
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
time as there was a quorum I checked a
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
few days ago to see where
 
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:41.420 align:start position:0%
the membership of that committee stood
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
and currently there is only one name
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
on that committee and that name is as a
 
00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
House member
 
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that particular House
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
member lost their election in the last
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
election cycle so literally there's
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's no one currently assigned to the
 
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.270 align:start position:0%
there's no one currently assigned to the
commission

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
Clee you were unable to your Quorum
 
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
Clee you were unable to your Quorum
because

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
appointments to the commission were not
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
there were appointments made to the
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
commission the speaker's office did make
 
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
commission the speaker's office did make
appointments

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak for the the Senate has
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
to make their appointment
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
and the public members typically are
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
appointed I Believe by the government I
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
know by the governor's office I know
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
the house members were appointed because
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
I was one of them
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh I can't speak for the other entities
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and this is
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit of a question
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
towards you I know there's a special
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
committee on committees and commissions
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
areas like this going to be addressed in
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
that committee or special committee and
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering whether we should
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
wait to act on this because if this is a
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation you know we should
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
probably take action at a later date
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
with the chair of that committee is
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan so I'll ask
 
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.010 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan so I'll ask
[Laughter]

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
him short answer is yes
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me are you saying we should not
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
pass this bill to save you the work
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
filling this commission this will this
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
issues like this will be addressed in in
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that committee committees that
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
don't meet or that don't have time to
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
meet or are
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
gone by the issue has gone by and this
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
particular bill this particular bill is
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
is not on our docket yet but uh it will
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
be one of the first ones that
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
the first commissions that we'll be
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
looking at to try to eliminate it uh and
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
save save some government you know
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
government spending
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
would you feel we stepped on your your
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee's toes if we uh
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
um actually I think this is more for the
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
executive session than for the fence of
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
the hearing I apologize are there any
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
specific questions to representative
 
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.849 align:start position:0%
specific questions to representative
Griffin

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:22.220 align:start position:0%
yes represent gold and representative
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question and you may not be
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
able to answer this but I wondered if in
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
the um reports you look at from
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
Professor Johnson at UNH if UNH is
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
reporting race data as part of the
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
demographics that that you've seen
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely the work they do over
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
there is very complete they they not
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
only have the U.S census I believe they
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
use the University's ability to do
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
polling within the state of New
 
00:43:56.579 --> 00:43:57.470 align:start position:0%
polling within the state of New
Hampshire

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
and so uh it's a resource it's it's
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
available to the legislature it's a
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
resource that uh director Caswell told
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
me he uses
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
and uh his area of Business Development
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
includes the planning
 
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.069 align:start position:0%
includes the planning
Department

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
which the demographer was supposed to be
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
so yes uh very very good work done over
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
question is actually for the chair also
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
or perhaps representative Dolan is there
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
a means by which committees that are
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
confronted with items like this can
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
officially refer their bills to that
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee if
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
some bills have been referred to those
 
00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:49.370 align:start position:0%
some bills have been referred to those
committees

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
this is not one of them so therefore
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's on our plate to make a decision
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
if we decide not to pass this bill then
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
the that commission is committee is
 
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.690 align:start position:0%
the that commission is committee is
still

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
able to review it under their chart
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
okay my my question though is it seems
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
there should be a mechanism one would
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
think so but but this is not an early
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
Bill therefore it is not one of the ones
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
that would be referred to that
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
commission all right they've got to
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
research it on their own thank you
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
Brooks on Dolan I it is this if it's
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
process let's finish with the the
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
witnesses first
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
we can okay any other questions of
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
represent a bear please excuse me
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony today
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I was doing a quick search trying to
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
find the
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
annual report that's supposed to be
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
filed with the governor the Speaker of
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
the House
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
if you could send me that link that
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
would be handy thank you
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
you're not alone in having that problem
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
when I first got appointed to the prior
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee I pulled the file from the
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
fourth floor of the office building just
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
told me and I went through that file and
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
I was unable to locate a single report
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
that had been done and as far as the
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
most recent committee the one where he
 
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.870 align:start position:0%
most recent committee the one where he
had

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:19.339 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh we had we have uh never met with the
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
s on Fitzpatrick
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.730 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
if

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
your commission had been meeting and and
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
doing what it was uh tasked to do would
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
you be
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
considering data on race and ethnic
 
00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:55.010 align:start position:0%
considering data on race and ethnic
background

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
I I it's hard for me to answer for a
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
whole commission but as as as a member
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's the the charge of the commission
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
really was to look at demographics and
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
it was one of the underlying on one of
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
the underlying problems with that was
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
we first had to educate everybody on
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
that Commission
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
on demographics and so typically what
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
would happen is the commission would be
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
appointed a chair would be appointed
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
and then we would have people come in
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
just as Ways and Means and finance does
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of each biennium
 
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.140 align:start position:0%
and they would testify and present
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
situations on the demographics and
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
housing and the economy and all the
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
related items and yes that's uh that's
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
what demographics is
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Griffin
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
I um representative Gallagher again
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.490 align:start position:0%
I um representative Gallagher again
um

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll keep this short since
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
um but yeah basically since my previous
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
Bill assigns additional duties to the
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
commission I would oppose the disbanding
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
of it as that would conflict with my
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
previous bill I think as to the point of
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons to disband it being
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
its mission is vague well I think that's
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that my bill helps
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
with is that it makes it less vague as
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
to the point of the um
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
data also being available
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
from UNH well
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
your unh
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
works together with
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
people on this committee so
 
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.010 align:start position:0%
people on this committee so
um

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think there is a possibility that
 
00:49:27.849 --> 00:49:27.859 align:start position:0%
removing the committee could
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
arm the quality of unh's own data
 
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.410 align:start position:0%
arm the quality of unh's own data
um

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
00:49:36.839 --> 00:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
um

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think having it be
 
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.170 align:start position:0%
I think having it be
um and

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.109 align:start position:0%
um and
official

00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
State body rather than a university
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
helps to give it extra credibility and
 
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.770 align:start position:0%
helps to give it extra credibility and
um

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
it it provides it provides a different
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
purpose than the university might and um
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
so I think it's worth keeping around and
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:50:12.599 --> 00:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
um

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions so
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
represent Timothy Horrigan from
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which is in
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
fact the home of unh and certainly UNOH
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
does have
 
00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:42.349 align:start position:0%
does have
um

00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
a white history of a strength in the
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
area of demographic and social research
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
and um but and the commission if we and
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
if we can if the commission I think
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
complements complements compliments that
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they cost these
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
commissions whether you're consider the
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
mileage very expensive or not that's uh
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's usually
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
that only kicks in if the person makes a
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
special trip to Concord or whatever the
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
commission is meeting anyway if you're
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
already going to conquer you don't get
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
double mileage for attending the
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
commission at least I hope that's not
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
how it works I have to confess even
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
though I've been here 13 years I've
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
never served on a statute a statutory
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
I've never been one of the people any of
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
the speakers as appointed to a statutory
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
Committee in fact I don't even recall
 
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.089 align:start position:0%
Committee in fact I don't even recall
really

00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
being actively actively invited the of
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
all the speakers I served on the one who
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
was the most interested in filling these
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
seats was uh my first speaker speaker
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
narelli and it's been less of a priority
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
for the other speakers and uh
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
man you think I probably did get it we
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
did get some somewhat perfunctory email
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
from our Majority Leader saying if
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
you're interested uh join but hasn't
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're not really very actively
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
recruiting the house members for these
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
committees in my appointment I am have
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
been a member of two of a committee and
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
also then a board
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
um that's under the Aegis of the
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office which isn't
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
technically a statutory committee
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
because they did it on their own
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
authority and um yes representative and
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh this Bill yes so I think if the uh
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
I think the mission I think obviously
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's an endemic problem and actually
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
well actually where that connection is
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office is very
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
strong institutional support for the
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
boards and committees that are under its
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
purview so you know they in fact uh
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
Senator Hennessey who wrote the Bill
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
that reconstituted the committee was one
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
of the people invited me to be on the
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
boards and I'm on now but um and she
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
strongly supported keeping the
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
commission around but um
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
so I think maybe we may be more
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
institutional support for all these
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
committees statutory committees but I
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
think this one is particularly valuable
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
one because uh we need
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know we need to become a younger and
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
more diverse State you know we need
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
ambitious young people coming
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
um from other parts of the country
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
they're more diverse than ours we need
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
to keep our ambitious young people who
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
grew up here in New Hampshire growing
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um so the issues
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
and certainly the issues that the
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
previous Bill addressed are amongst
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
those at the state government has to
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
address in order to keep our young
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
people here and also um
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
and that's this commission is a valuable
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
resource from it regardless of whether
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
or not it's actually being
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
reaching its full potential which it
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
apparently at the moment it's not
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so and you may need to you may need
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
to uh you may need to restructure it uh
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
Red's just having the six members
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor hopefully
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
since he actually talked about this in
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
his budget address maybe filling those
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
six slots has now again become a higher
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
priority for his office but yeah so I
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
think anyway we should keep the
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
committee around and that
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
that doesn't uh necessarily it doesn't
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily change the fact that there's
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
the committee on commissions and other
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
bodies are looking at all these
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
committees commissions and so forth but
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
this particular one uh we should keep it
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
around we should keep it around and we
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
should make an effort to uh make it more
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
viable so thank you
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Oregon yeah
 
00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
Peter Schmidt representing Stratford 14
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
city of Dover award Ward one
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and I decided to speak on this issue
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
because uh I had the privilege about
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
15 years ago I think to hear a lecture
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
over at the tuck Library across the
 
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.470 align:start position:0%
over at the tuck Library across the
street

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:56.540 align:start position:0%
by Peter Francis
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
who is a very noted demographer I'm not
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
sure whether he has died in the meantime
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
I hope not because he's a brilliant guy
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
and very knowledgeable it was a an
 
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:12.260 align:start position:0%
extremely instructive
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
presentation that he made and I've just
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
sent you a uh an email forwarded you an
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
article by Brad cook who's a noted New
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney uh on this and he's
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
writing on the subject of demographics
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire among other things
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I I would ask the chair to
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the rest of the
 
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:41.660 align:start position:0%
committee because
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think we abandoned this committee or
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
Commission and that representative
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Griffin has talked to us about at our
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
own Peril while I sympathize with him in
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
his uh
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
dearth of
 
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:00.980 align:start position:0%
committee members or commission members
 
00:56:03.849 --> 00:56:03.859 align:start position:0%
I know what it's like because
 
00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I was the surviving member if you
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
will of the
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
 
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.910 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
classification

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
classification
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
and it's one of our very important
 
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.710 align:start position:0%
and it's one of our very important
committees

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
please bear with me I'm only taking a
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
few minutes
 
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.329 align:start position:0%
few minutes
um

00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the the thing is the governor and
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
his staff are extremely busy in terms of
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
filling uh required committees and
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
commission positions uh and it may be a
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
while before he uh he can he and his
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
people can get around to this current
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
commission so I sympathize with
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but demographics is is like gravity
 
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
you can't get away from it and uh and
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
the reality is that if we don't know
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
anything about New Hampshire's
 
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.470 align:start position:0%
anything about New Hampshire's
demographics

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
aside from the fact that that Professor
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
Johnson is doing an admirable job but
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
the state also needs to be on top of the
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
situation so I think we need to think
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
about it very carefully before we
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
um jettison this particular commission
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
and I urge you all to read the email
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
that I just sent to to uh representative
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
McGuire because uh it's the our
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
demographics are a slow dive off the
 
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
diving board the dive can be slow but
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
once you're off the board gravity takes
 
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
over so and demographics are already
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
doing a number on the state of New
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so thank you I'll I'll answer
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
any questions anybody may have
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little confused as to why the
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
government has to be doing this
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
for instance U-Haul tracks where
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
why do you think the government should
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
be doing this you mentioned that
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in representative Gerhart
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
is questioning why you think that's
 
00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.809 align:start position:0%
is questioning why you think that's
important

00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
well I we have a lot of functions as the
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
members of the state legislature and uh
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
so that that's one of our functions is
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
to determine whether certain things are
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
wise in in our judgment as a committee
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm not sure that the
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
government necessarily has to be the
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
only one doing it but to the degree that
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
you have something as absolutely crucial
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the further uh benefit and survival
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire As We Know
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
It uh I think the government
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
ought to be paying some attention to
 
00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:45.890 align:start position:0%
ought to be paying some attention to
that

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
well the reason I'm saying this is first
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
off U-Haul and other companies actually
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
track where people are moving from
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
within the United States
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
so they can say for instance this is
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
2021 but Tennessee was the state that
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
most Americans were moving to for
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
instance so Mike my concern is just the
 
00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
government is not most likely to be the
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
most accurate producer of this
 
00:59:07.799 --> 00:59:09.170 align:start position:0%
most accurate producer of this
information

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
when it's can be tilted by the political
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
winds as we've seen recently last couple
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
years so I'm just concerned about
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
putting all that you know what I'm
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
saying it seems like a waste of money
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm concerned about but
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
I take your point but uh I think that
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's our function as the Edna
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
committee is to examine the bills that
 
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:30.980 align:start position:0%
come before us and the issues they raise
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
and to exercise our best judgment on
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Clegg do you wish to testify on this
 
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.630 align:start position:0%
Mr Clegg do you wish to testify on this
bill

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay well Casey's the only other person
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
here so I will close the public hearing
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:19.130 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
we're going into executive session
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
does someone have emotion about House
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 64 which is the first one we heard
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
Madam Cheryl yes itl all right is there
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
okay shoot and
 
01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:42.829 align:start position:0%
okay shoot and
gold

01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
gold
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
how would you like to speak to your
 
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.589 align:start position:0%
how would you like to speak to your
motion

01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
yes um actually I'll uh
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'll read the committee statement that
 
01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the goals of this sponsor
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
are laudable uh there does not seem to
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
be an appetite on the part of the
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislature or the executive to fulfill
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
this since they did not provide the
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
necessary appointments the testimony
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
indicated that UNH wishes to study this
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
issue and there's nothing preventing
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
them from doing so and they certainly
 
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:30.740 align:start position:0%
would share any findings and information
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
with the government if we ask
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gould do you wish to
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
speak to your second I think um
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative schuett said it well I
 
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.750 align:start position:0%
representative schuett said it well I
would

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
um just add that
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
in an environment and and I've heard
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
this for the last 10 years the
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
aggravation with the number of
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
commissions and the expense and to keep
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
a commission that is clearly not being
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
active and doesn't have any
 
01:02:00.119 --> 01:02:02.890 align:start position:0%
active and doesn't have any
representative

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:02.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure you know
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
what's about how 64. right and sending
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
the scope and so
 
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.049 align:start position:0%
the scope and so
um

01:02:11.049 --> 01:02:11.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:14.540 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of a of a commission
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
to replicate something that UNH is
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
already providing uh
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem necessary thank you
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you for a
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
different reason I am uh I am not going
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
to support this I yes dispel the
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
original commission is very lofty I
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
think it's worthwhile it should be in my
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
opinion should be kept to take a look at
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
but what is being done out of this and
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
to me it's like in the good golf swing
 
01:02:51.049 --> 01:02:51.059 align:start position:0%
it's the follow-through so what is the
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
follow through with this it's time to
 
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
look and it is not covered in this bill
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
or not should be covered in this bill it
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
should be other things to start looking
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
at Workforce housing other type of
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
things that would increase the
 
01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
demographics in a particular community
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
so if the fixing of the demographics is
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
what we need to fix I think this bill
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
falls short and actually compiles the
 
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
falls short and actually compiles the
information

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
but it could fall short of the fall
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
through to reach that lofty goal thank
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah my representative Gerhart thank you
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
my concern is
worse

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna hold off comments okay thank
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
you I I'm representative Dolan I just
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a clarification uh
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien just said doesn't
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
support you don't support the itl or
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't support the the commission
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
he doesn't he supports the itl because
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bill does not support its goals got
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
it is that correct right yeah exactly it
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
it identifies another problem one that I
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
think is a bigger there's something else
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will not be
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill based on one fact
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
the bill says that basically we want to
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
measure what we have for diversity in
 
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yet the testimony
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
contradicts that by saying we want to
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
increase the diversity thank you okay
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
all right yeah I'm
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about demographics but
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
I do know that race at race and
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
ethnicity are
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
what one of the components of
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
demographics and if we have a commission
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
on demographics it will automatically
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
consider race and ethnicity so I don't
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary to tell them to do
 
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.089 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary to tell them to do
that

01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:56.099 --> 01:04:57.349 align:start position:0%
that
uh

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
and so I'm supporting the itl
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is itl on
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 64 and the clerk can follow
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
do you think we should consider House
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 228 as well or should you do okay
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital 228
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
president Gerhard all right opening
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
crowded you so speak to your motion I do
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
I've served on several several
 
01:06:29.099 --> 01:06:30.829 align:start position:0%
I've served on several several
commissions

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:33.289 align:start position:0%
commissions
and

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
these commissions are important to my
 
01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.270 align:start position:0%
these commissions are important to my
constituents

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that as the chair of
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
these commissions
 
01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:46.099 align:start position:0%
I spend a significant amount of time
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
um people's appointments
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
and it's not because people don't care
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's because they are busy
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of responsibility as legislators
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
so that when an organization like the
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
college the University of New Hampshire
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
is doing something
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
and the work is being done by people
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
that are experienced and knowledgeable
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to partner with
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
our institutions such as UNH to to help
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm disappointed to have heard that
 
01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
the commission did not meet
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
there were no reports
 
01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.490 align:start position:0%
there were no reports
and

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
although when we're talking about money
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about mileage
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people's time I
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
don't know about your time but my time
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
is valuable I place a value on the
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
amount of time I spend coming to Concord
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
sitting on commissions going to
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
delegation meetings and I do those
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
things because they are valuable to my
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
constituents and therefore valuable to
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
me but my time is worth something
 
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to think that everybody has
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
that viewpoint
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry if I sound I just when
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
people say to me things don't cost
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
anything it drives me crazy because it
 
01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.349 align:start position:0%
anything it drives me crazy because it
does

01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't if the commission's not
 
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
so I don't if the commission's not
meeting

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
I just don't think we should continue it
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that we take a look at
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
it again at a dude you know I mean it's
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
such as a tiny little scope and I think
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to do something like
 
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we should look at it as a whole
 
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.450 align:start position:0%
that we should look at it as a whole
thing

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
and you know you can you can increase
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
affordable housing but then when you're
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to force people of certain
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
demographics to go there I mean that
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
I think this is serious so I think that
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know these are all the reasons why I
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
support passing this and this is not
 
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.530 align:start position:0%
support passing this and this is not
easy

01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
because I do believe in diversity I do
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
believe in having but if it's not going
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
to happen it's not going to happen you
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
can't force something like that I don't
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
believe you can
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm so sorry this is so
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
long-winded but I think it's important
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
to talk about these things and to
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
express our thoughts on this because
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhard is to
 
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.809 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhard is to
speak

01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
I will agree with with representative
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
Gorda that time is valuable and I don't
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
think it should just be calculated in
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
knowledge and sense
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I I really did not realize the
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
amount of time involved with this whole
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
conquer gig until I actually got here
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
and this is you guys yeah anyway so
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
I just as far as the demographic Trends
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
and stuff and I understand that we want
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
to increase young families move to New
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I'm I think that's more
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
accomplished through the free market and
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
just lowering taxes and making it easier
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
for families to live here I don't think
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of putting up the right
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
billboard on the Massachusetts border or
 
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of stuff I just think
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
just you need to make the society that
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
you want so if you want more people to
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
have kids offer to take care of people's
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
kids and stuff like that I just think
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's a local individual level so point
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
being I agree and thank you
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other comments
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt of course
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
is opposed
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I oppose uh an ought to pass because
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
most of us even myself do not know
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
enough about this subject and we're
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
throwing away a commission
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
we should be retaining this bill to find
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
out it sounds to me like the structure
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
of the commission is flawed at the very
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
least uh I I don't see any reason why
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
there should be four Reps for example on
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
such a such a commission we know that
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
the Senate you know doesn't like to
 
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
serve on these committees and and the
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
bills in my early years here the
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
commission the such bills always had two
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
or three senators and every time
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
virtually the the the Senate would strip
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
it down to one Senator so uh they they
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
are really stretched thin as I'm sure
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
even the freshmen recognize it's a 24 7
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
job if they're going to do it right uh
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
and and some of the people do not have
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
that kind of time so but uh but the
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
point is that to abandon this commission
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
when some of us know next to nothing
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
about the demographic situation and we
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
need to get informed before we junk a
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
commission that's looking at
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
demographics so I will be opposing the
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you okay
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
I also representative gold
 
01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:03.980 align:start position:0%
now is one I can say my my part about
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
with we have commissions that are really
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
urgent and with such a trend toward
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
overtaxed and overuse that we heard from
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and everyone else's testimony I think
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's important that we focus the limited
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
resources on matters that are Urgent
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
which isn't to say demographics isn't
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
urgent but I really like the fact that I
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
heard from representative Griffin that
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
UNH is providing the information so we
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
all can get educated about demographics
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh building and then
 
01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:43.010 align:start position:0%
representative uh building and then
Lexus

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
Lexus
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I want to
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank representative Griffin for trying
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
to get this ball started and you know
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the folks there available
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
and also thank him for the information
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
brought forward that the university
 
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
system is providing some of this a great
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
deal of this information and it is being
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
used by both finance and Ways and Means
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
which is good to hear that that
 
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:10.580 align:start position:0%
information is out there and available
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
and I think we all know that with this
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
special committee we are looking at a
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
number of committees and commissions
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
that we are over taxed with here and
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
trying to support with the limited
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time legislators and Senators
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
have that if information is available
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
without having to put together a
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
commission or committee that is the way
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
to go thank you
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh yeah I understand the
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
the desire to educate members of the
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
House on this but I I don't see that
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
having this commission would be
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
particularly effective what might be
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
more effective is you know get a notice
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
in the calendar to let everyone know
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
that this resource at UNH is available
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
link off to the report and if they want
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
to get into it further let them know how
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
they can contact the people there I
 
01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
think that'd be much more effective than
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
creating this commission which may even
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
if it does meet it might generate a
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
report I think it I don't know that it's
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to be it's unlikely to be anything
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
better than what we already have in UNH
 
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's not right in that case the motion
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass by representing Broda
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%

you might be able to end this this but
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the boards might were the
 
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.330 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the boards might were the
changes

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
changes

I'm just trying to I'm looking for the
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
word will the change is motivated by
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
safety or changes in available
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
technology do you know
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
ones that I remember specifically were
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
to settle conflicts within the codes or
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
to allow options that were needed okay
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire looking at the
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
face of 564 and by committee I don't
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
mean to hang it up on that it says
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
education should that really
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
in future be read as uh you know Edna uh
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know why this went to education
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
but as you could tell it was very
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
quickly vacated to them so it was
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative blackis thank you uh

01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
someone else who can answer it better
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
um I haven't had a chance to review the
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
changes thank you for sending them but
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%

proposed
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
um are expected to increase the cost of
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
building in any way that gets into the
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
concern well anyway I believe you should
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
well you should ask the other people for
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%

provide a quick summary statement and
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
then I have copies of each of the
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
Amendments if anybody wants to get into
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
the details so the building code review
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
board is pleased to forward eight
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
building code amendments to the current
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Building Code with
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
our recommendation that these be
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
ratified these Amendments have been
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by the board after
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and they include three
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
amendments which relax energy
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
requirements for changes of occupancy in
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
existing buildings so that's a reduction
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
in cost four amendments that came out of
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Greece Interceptor study with Des
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
last summer and that was there's
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
probably no difference in costs that
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
just sorted out who is enforcing what
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
and how some things were defined to
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
bring our code into into alignment and
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
Des into alignment so we met in the
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
middle on some of that uh
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
and one Amendment came from the solar
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
industry uh in the in the main building
 
01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.330 align:start position:0%
industry uh in the in the main building
code

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
we referenced the fire code for solar
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
panels on roofs we neglected when we did
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
that in 2018
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
to fix the international residential
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
code which applies to single-family
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
homes so all that Amendment does is pull
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
out the explicit requirements in the IRC
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
and reference the state fire code where
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
all of that solar stuff was worked out
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
so that was more a housekeeping issue
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
but in fact it will it will save some
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
money over the model code
 
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.669 align:start position:0%
money over the model code
uh

01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
a ninth amendment just just to keep you
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the loop involved some flood zone
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
requirements was not approved by the
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
board and it's under further review so
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
that may come back later so thank you
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
for your consideration happy to answer
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions yes
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative like us thank you um yeah
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for those answers and and I'll
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
be uh looking at the Greece Interceptor
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
stuff again
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
um but my larger question on cost is
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
well first of all what building code are
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
we operating under now and if we're as I
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
understand it this is looking to adopt a
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
newer building code
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
what changes between those two would
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
you know would increase cost and any
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
general ideas to what extent so these
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
are amendments to the current building
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
code we're not going to a new model code
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
we're on the 2018 cycle with the 22
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
National Electric 2020 National Electric
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
Code none of these apply to that code so
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
these uh all amend the code that's in
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
place now we're in a little bit of an
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
interim year next year uh if things
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
progress as we expect we'll be back here
 
01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:48.380 align:start position:0%
to change the model codes to the 2021
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
series of the seven seven that make up
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
the building code the electric code Will
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
Follow by a year
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
can you be more specific about the
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the model code if you are altering a
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
building so I I have an office building
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to do some Renovations
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be an office
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
building there's a shopping list of
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
things that you do not need to comply
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
with energy conservation for instance
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
instead of having to provide the proper
 
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
amount of insulation in a wall it only
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
kicks in if you if you open up that wall
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then you only have to put as much
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
insulation as will fit you don't have to
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
build a new outside wall
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
if you change the occupancy in the model
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
code none of those exceptions applied so
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
basically if you went from an office to
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
a retail store you'd have to meet the
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
energy code as though it was a new
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
building so what those amendments do and
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
there's three of them that just pick up
 
01:24:59.410 --> 01:24:59.420 align:start position:0%
the different parts of the code
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
basically say that that list of
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
exceptions that applies for alterations
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
can also be used for changes of
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
occupancy therefore reducing the cost to
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
its effective reuse of a building if
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to change what they're
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
doing with it it results in less energy
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
conservation just for practicality
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
so this is for commercial space though
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
or is it just change of use for
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
commercial to residential or is it only
 
01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
within the commercial commercial sphere
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
one and two family dwellings
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
but it does kick in for other
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
residential multi-family dwellings
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you never change an
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
occupancy for a one and two family
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
dwelling or it's not a one and two
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
family dwelling anymore
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr chairman uh I my question
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
goes to one of your remarks about uh a
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
blending of uh two sets of codes I think
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
the building code the plumbing code or
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and and I'm wondering uh
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
whether you are referencing or we're
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
referencing this working group that you
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and several a
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
number of other very experienced
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
staffers and Craftsmen and so forth from
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
both the plumbing side and the
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection side and so
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
forth uh work together is that the the
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
working group that you were referencing
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
in in your remark about one of the
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
changes that this bill would Institute
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh you'll recall that
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
coming out of that we issued a report
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
and said that Des was going to amend
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
their rules through their process we
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
were going to amend the the code
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions through the amendment process
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
so a couple of those amendments apply to
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
the international plumbing code and a
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
couple apply to the residential code
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
because we had to hit different sections
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
of those codes
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative LeBron
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
um I did have a question but uh not so
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
much as for the gentleman but uh to uh
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
assist representative grotta but I think
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
it could be best uh handle and I was
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
going to mention what the term we use in
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
the business grandfathering but I think
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
that could be handled in executive
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
session so thank you thank you
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
say no further questions thank you for
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.219 --> 01:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
my name is Sean Toomey I'm a State Fire
 
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
Marshal I'm going to speak specifically
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the fire code provisions and changes
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the 2018 State Fire
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
code as as adopted and ratified by the
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
general court we've looked at two
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
amendments to the fire code in the last
 
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
few months that came up that we need to
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
address and the first one is relative to
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
NFPA 37 which concerns generator fuel
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
lines there's a requirement in the code
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
that you were not allowed to have a
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
valve with a handle on it and the fuel
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
line from the fuel tank to the generator
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
for some reason what we discovered
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
working with Des is they needed to they
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
also need to tightness test the fuel
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
line to make sure there's no leak and
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
without that valve you can't do that
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
properly without taking the whole
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
assembly apart and then trying to put it
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
back together which kind of defeats the
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
whole tightness testing so the there's
 
01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
very similar language in from a fuel
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
tank to an oil burning appliance that
 
01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
allows the valve in place and you just
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
remove the handle so typically people
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mess with the handle after the
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
tightness testing was done so we align
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
the language in NFPA 37 to have a valve
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
in place and the handle removed so it
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
matches the two appliances and it allows
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
proper tightness testing from
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
environmental perspective from a cost
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
perspective I'm guessing the valves will
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
touch more but there's probably less
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
label labor taking it all apart and
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
trying to defeat that part the Second
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm just going to speak to
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
briefly but it's going to come in as
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment I think
 
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire will speak to a
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
minute but if you want I can speak to it
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
later or now it's I guess it's up to if
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's about the amendment specifically it
 
01:29:57.169 --> 01:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
will hold off until we get to the
 
01:29:59.810 --> 01:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
amendment 108 okay so if as the bill is
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
right now that though that's the only
 
01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
one that's being contemplated until the
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
amendment comes in I have one other one
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
to add then so any questions happy to
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:13.139 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you very much thank you
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to testify on HP
 
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.709 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to testify on HP
564

01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
564
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
so you know what I'm going to close the
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
hearing and I am going to open the
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on Amendment 2023-0091
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
or HB 5664 and welcome back
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
committee Carol McGuire mayor Mack
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
District 27 and this is this amendment
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
is at the request of the fire marshal it
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
includes one change to the state fire
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
code that was adopted after house bill
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
five uh 564 was finished so I had to
 
01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
come in with an amendment it updates
 
01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.209 align:start position:0%
through the
um

01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
January meeting of the board of Fire
 
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.450 align:start position:0%
January meeting of the board of Fire
Control

01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
Control
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it also adds to the board of Fire
 
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.020 align:start position:0%
Control a fire protection engineer
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
the membership of the of the board of
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
Fire Control had been
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
created quite some time ago and now
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
there are fire protection engineers in
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
the state that would be willing to work
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
and the fire marshal believes their
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
service on the board will be useful so I
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
I support that
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh sorry
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
you for
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just curious uh is that
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
fire protection engineer is that a new
 
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh designation for an officer well it's
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
newer than the board of Fire Control
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
which I believe is from the 60s
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I don't know how much
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
newer it to be
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas
 
01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
oh I have questions any Amendment but if
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
if you're someone else is Mr Timmy's
 
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking to you yeah
 
01:32:06.169 --> 01:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
again Sean tomb in the State Fire
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
Marshal and so the uh the one amendment
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
that we addressed uh in January when we
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
adopted the 2018 codes we did a
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
um food trucks Mobile Food units so food
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
trucks or trailers they added a
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
provision around gas uh certification so
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
a gas
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like a great idea so once a
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
year a gas technician would come in take
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
a look at the gas system on the mobile
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
food truck or or trailer make sure it's
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
safe and certify it well when it came to
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
practice everyone kind of scratched
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
their heads the industry and quite
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
frankly the fire service of how do we
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
really do that it seemed like a great
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
idea you just go into an inspection sign
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
off on it but where these trucks and
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
trailers are on the move a lot there's
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
some question about really truly what
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
standard should apply to the inspection
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
so so we look forward to the 2021
 
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
edition of the co we talked to many
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
other communities we talked to the gas
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
industry and realized that the the
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
direct Direction really is to put a gas
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
detector in the truck or the trailer and
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
forego the inspection the the benefit
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be the gas detector would be when
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's working would be sniffing for gas
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
essentially your gas leak all the time
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
it will alert the people in the trailer
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
to evacuate if there was a gas issue and
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
call 9-1-1 essentially so we we had a
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
public hearing at the board of Fire
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
Control everyone supported it it was
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously and I brought forward
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
for you for ratification
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh the second one I can speak to the the
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
as far as the fire protection engineer
 
01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:46.810 align:start position:0%
as far as the fire protection engineer
goes

01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:46.820 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
as representative McGuire indicated the
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
board of Fire Control has been around
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
for many many years I think some of the
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
earlier stuff is back in like 1947 it
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
does I think in the or 60s 70s there was
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
a couple of small changes there were a
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
very limited number of fire protection
 
01:34:03.770 --> 01:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
engineers in the state
 
01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
um 20 years ago when I became an
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
engineer I think there was I was the
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
fifth fire protection engineer that was
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
around in New Hampshire we probably have
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
a dozen plus of them now and I've had
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
several ask hey why don't we have a fire
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
protection engineer on the board of Fire
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
Control we work to protect people from
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
fire and the effects of fire do a lot of
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
work in the code industry as far as
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes this the board
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
of Fire Control serves an advisory
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
capacity to me in the office and also
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
very active in the code development
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
process and evaluation on the on the
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
fire code side so it seemed to make a
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
lot of sense and that's why we bring it
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
forward to you today for incorporation
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
on the board of Fire Control thank you
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer questions great are
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
there any questions yes representative
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Gerhard thank you chairman hmm
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
concerning the Mobile Food detection
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
just this is gonna be a multi-part thing
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
if that's okay so just just ask a
 
01:34:57.169 --> 01:34:57.179 align:start position:0%
question let him answer and then you can
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
ask so the annual the annual requirement
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
the inspection how much was that I've
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
been told that it varies by by
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
contractor essentially but I'm here as
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
about 150 dollars uh per per visit is
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
what I was told by at least two vendors
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
the previous correct okay so the
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
gas detection device how much is that
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
and how do you determine if those are
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
working is there still a yearly
 
01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:24.179 align:start position:0%
inspection of that gas device now that's
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm curious about yeah so the
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
devices that we found were around 50 to
 
01:35:27.659 --> 01:35:29.149 align:start position:0%
devices that we found were around 50 to
100

01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and that they're intended to do like
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
a monthly test so they push the bunch
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
like we should test our smoke alarms on
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
our home so we'd push the button to test
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
it to make sure that they were
 
01:35:38.639 --> 01:35:40.430 align:start position:0%
it to make sure that they were
functioning

01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
last follow-up follow-up so so are you
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
required to test these gas monitors in
 
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
these mobile food trucks the fire
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
service well do they have any is there
 
01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.179 align:start position:0%
any way to actually enforce that that
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
they actually is such a device in these
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
units and that they actually are working
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
so typically uh the food trucks are are
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensed by the municipalities for their
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
for allowing on the Food Service side
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it comes with that typical fire a
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
quick fire inspection so I would say
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
that we the fire service would be able
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
to check to see the devices in place uh
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
and I I don't I can't I would I can't
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
say for sure whether every Fire official
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
in the state would physically touch them
 
01:36:19.729 --> 01:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
but I would hope that they would look at
 
01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
them at least make sure they're there
 
01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
there's some requirements in the code
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
that talks about the the operator should
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
be testing them by depressing the button
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you you're awesome yes
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
morning Marshall
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh so uh the the certification or
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
licensing that you referenced just a
 
01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:47.300 align:start position:0%
moment ago with regard to uh
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative gerhardt's question uh
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
that inspection is done locally and that
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
food truck is is licensed for use in
 
01:36:59.090 --> 01:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
that Community only or is that that
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
inspection and Licensing allow that food
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
truck to be on the uh the road anywhere
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire with with
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh or do they have to get licensed and
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
permitted in every community that they
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
sell in
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so I don't know that all the
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
specifics on the Food Service licensing
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
side there I will say there was a bill
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
last uh last session that talked about
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do a Statewide food truck
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
license that would help minimize the
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
requirements around licensing at each
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
different community so I think
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
I think I know there's some communities
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
that require licensure Concord I know
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
does from my previous time in Concord
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester does Nashua does
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know that you get into
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
the smaller communities there's not that
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
food truck license
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is the
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
possibility that there could be kind of
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
a race to the bottom uh that somebody
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
would say well I I couldn't get licensed
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh by the I I have my food truck based
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
in let's say uh Community x uh I
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
couldn't get licensed there because they
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
know me I'm sloppy whatever you know and
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
so they get licensed in in community why
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
instead of community X because it's it's
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
easier to get you know past there uh and
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned about the the safety
 
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:33.179 align:start position:0%
if there's not some kind of
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
a correct standard that's being applied
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
but for the safe operation of these
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
trucks which uh are great facilities
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
I've I've bought from them uh but uh but
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
to the degree that they have a lot of
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
not only food so sanitation is a real
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
important this issue but also uh if
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're using gas and propane and that
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
other kind of stuff their potential fire
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
hazard so I'm concerned about it could
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
you speak to that
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
so I think the uh
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
again the bill last session was trying
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
to address many of those comments that
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
you were speaking of about the different
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
Community standards and things like that
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the in the fire code Provisions uh as
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
they are today
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
the Fire official in a local community
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
would be able to go and make sure that
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
the the unit's safe and operating safely
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of the state fire
 
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.410 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of the state fire
code

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we talk about really
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
just speaks to the a gas technician from
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
say Irving or uh
 
01:39:39.169 --> 01:39:39.179 align:start position:0%
Rhymes or some other company that comes
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
in and does an inspection on that truck
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
for for the gas system uh and instead
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
puts that detector in so we can still
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
the fire officials can go in and still
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that the hood systems are
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
operating properly the the suppression
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
for the Hood is still there and
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
functioning as and has been inspected
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
that inspection requirement is still
 
01:40:02.689 --> 01:40:02.699 align:start position:0%
there and we can make sure that the gas
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
detection device if this all gets
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
ratified is there and is in place but we
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
speaking to the Food Service side and
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
the sanitation and those things that
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's outside the purview of the state
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
fire code and I don't know
 
01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately that still is gonna I
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
think very community community and this
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
this really doesn't address that at all
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't really be the appropriate
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
spot to address it in my opinion under
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the fire code follow up do you have the
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
staff sufficient staff to carry out that
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
function this this specific this issue
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
that I'm raising you just said the
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
inspector can do this or the Fire
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
official can do this do you have
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient staff in your own
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
organization to handle that I would
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
always love more staff oh
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
much like anyone else right uh I would
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
say that we in conjunction with the
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
local fire departments it would be a
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative effort between our office
 
01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:01.139 align:start position:0%
and the local fire departments to get
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
this this task completed
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
um with the food trucks we our office
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
would not personally go out and do all
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
of these inspections of the trucks we
 
01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
would rely on the help of the local
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
departments okay thank you
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Graham
 
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:18.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair uh Marshall
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe declare clean some of that
 
01:41:21.239 --> 01:41:22.070 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe declare clean some of that
up

01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll let you the opportunity to
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
discuss interoperability with many
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
different agencies it's not just a
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
standalone of the Fire Marshal's Office
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
so in the case of like let's use Nashua
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
as an example Nashua covers for public
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
health uh geographic area equally as
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
well anybody come into the city with the
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
food truck and everything has to be
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
inspected they do agree to spot
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
inspections they test the temperature of
 
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
the food how what is the temperature of
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
the hot water tank and just another
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
parameters and I don't think it's too
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
far of a reach that they would check the
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh the gas detectors equally as well as
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
well of what is required so there seems
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
to be a multi-tier level of inspections
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
because of this interoper
 
01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
interoperability of many agencies with
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
the one focused goal to go with this
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
which you were great I would concur with
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
that I think though
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
the one thing to uh speak at the
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt's comment is I
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
think there was an intent to have a
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide license to try to minimize the
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
changes and again this did this doesn't
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
contemplate that at all but
 
01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:33.659 align:start position:0%
um you know I think maybe some for
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
future discussion if there's trying to
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
help the industry deal with a Statewide
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
license but as far as the locals helping
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
the locals our office working with them
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
the food the DHS DHHS food inspectors
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
work with the locals that there's a lot
 
01:42:48.609 --> 01:42:48.619 align:start position:0%
of Cooperative work
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
and dealing with that to try to make
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
sure these units are safe
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative gold
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I have a
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
constituent who raised the very concerns
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here so I want to
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand carefully what
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
this does is it changes the state rule
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
that we live in a very rural area in
 
01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.410 align:start position:0%
that we live in a very rural area in
Warner

01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
Warner
 
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.430 align:start position:0%
Warner
um

01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
so that the Warner fire chief will be
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
following this guideline and not require
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
the local gas person an additional
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars say inspection
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct am I understanding it
 
01:43:34.209 --> 01:43:34.219 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah we're neighbors I think
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
so the uh the the Chief France would and
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
follow this provision uh when say the
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
Warner Fall Foliage Festival comes into
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
town and there's three or four food
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
trucks that show up he would just go and
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
make sure that that gas detector is
 
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
there and that's it and not say hey did
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
you have XYZ gas company do an
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
inspection and certification and look
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
for a certificate and that type of thing
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're welcome
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative a bear
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%

Mr chair
um

01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
I guess as I read this as I've listened
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
to all of the testimonies I've checked
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
with Pelham fire department nobody sees
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
a problem with this this seems like this
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
just streamlines cleans a lot of things
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
up handles a few administrative things
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
gives some Freedom back to the food
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
trucks to have a monitor they don't have
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
to wait for an appointment for you guys
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
to show up
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:31.550 align:start position:0%

thank you I I have not either I this
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%

kept the current Provisions as it is in
 
01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
the code today requiring the gas
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
certification by a company that's that's
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
the big concern for the food truck
 
01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:45.709 align:start position:0%
the big concern for the food truck
industry

there you go it's not amended until the
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
house acts are true enough
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
with the men we'll carry them in the
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
it I understand
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
um right I I think these are you know
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable amendments the reason I
 
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the motion is that some
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
of them include the uh changes to the
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
grease trap rules that
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
were uh negotiated and and uh you know
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Sherman and others were involved when
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
we had the interim study uh
 
01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh committee on those and I think these
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
are you know nothing's reduced safety
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
and it should they're just practical
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
things I think that uh
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%

said by representative leckis
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
no one else wish to cut to comment
 
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.410 align:start position:0%

03:00:54.590 --> 03:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
just for the record for people who
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
weren't with us previously um I'm Eric

which is Marriott County District 20 and
 
03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
I am here

03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:01:11.279 --> 03:01:13.370 align:start position:0%
house bill
617

03:01:13.370 --> 03:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
617
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
an act prohibiting with limit exceptions
 
03:01:19.849 --> 03:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
agencies from requiring use of
 
03:01:22.429 --> 03:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
proprietary software and interactions
 
03:01:24.250 --> 03:01:24.260 align:start position:0%
with the public
 
03:01:24.260 --> 03:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
with the public
so

03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:27.530 --> 03:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
I've been before this committee a few
 
03:01:34.010 --> 03:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
times previously with some of my other
 
03:01:34.020 --> 03:01:34.849 align:start position:0%
times previously with some of my other
um

03:01:34.849 --> 03:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
with some of my other
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
03:01:42.410 --> 03:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
also came from the same bill that this
 
03:01:44.809 --> 03:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
was split out from last term this is
 
03:01:48.190 --> 03:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
another one that was part of last terms
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
software action which I was using as an
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
acronym for securing our freedom to
 
03:01:57.410 --> 03:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
 
03:01:57.420 --> 03:01:58.070 align:start position:0%
write and read everything
um

03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
so yeah part of the criticism there was
 
03:02:05.690 --> 03:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do too much in a single
 
03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:07.309 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do too much in a single
bill

03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:02:07.319 --> 03:02:07.969 align:start position:0%
bill
um

03:02:07.969 --> 03:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:07.979 --> 03:02:09.530 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:02:09.530 --> 03:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
I took that criticism to heart and then
 
03:02:16.429 --> 03:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
thus split up into
 
03:02:16.439 --> 03:02:17.090 align:start position:0%
thus split up into
um

03:02:17.090 --> 03:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different bills um so yeah
 
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
most of them are coming back here to
 
03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
Edina but also one went to Judiciary one
 
03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
went to criminal justice and then one is
 
03:02:30.349 --> 03:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
going to be going to St e so that was a
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
question last time around is why isn't
 
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
this going to stnu well one of them is
 
03:02:39.070 --> 03:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
um so this one is the part for um
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
what citizens can be required to use
 
03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:45.410 align:start position:0%
what citizens can be required to use
um

03:02:45.410 --> 03:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:49.969 --> 03:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
when they interact with the state so
 
03:02:49.979 --> 03:02:50.929 align:start position:0%
when they interact with the state so
um

03:02:50.929 --> 03:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
yeah it has a list of
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
it has a list of
 
03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:56.750 align:start position:0%
it has a list of
um

03:02:56.750 --> 03:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:58.730 align:start position:0%
um
situations

03:02:58.730 --> 03:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
situations
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
where it's supposed to
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
03:03:05.030 --> 03:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
um you know saying including but not
 
03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
limited to meaning there may be others I
 
03:03:09.170 --> 03:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
forgot left out
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
um filing or payment of taxes remote
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
appearance for court proceedings taking
 
03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
of standardized tests or completion of
 
03:03:18.769 --> 03:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
course work by schools students applying
 
03:03:20.809 --> 03:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
for or receiving other unemployment
 
03:03:22.870 --> 03:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
benefits or other similar benefits
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
unless the government has determined
 
03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
that proprietary software is the only
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
means available for the required
 
03:03:28.979 --> 03:03:30.830 align:start position:0%
means available for the required
interaction

03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:31.849 align:start position:0%
interaction
um

03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:31.859 --> 03:03:34.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
the thing is um
 
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
so this this is just on the end of the
 
03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
public that it's applying to it's not
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
saying anything about what the
 
03:03:51.290 --> 03:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
government itself can or can't use it's
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
just what it can require members of the
 
03:03:58.490 --> 03:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
public to use so like when you're filing
 
03:04:01.010 --> 03:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
your Medicaid redetermination
 
03:04:02.750 --> 03:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
or um
 
03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:04.370 align:start position:0%
or um
or

03:04:04.370 --> 03:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:04:07.010 --> 03:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
food stamps redetermination or whatever
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
and need to upload proofs that they
 
03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:11.690 align:start position:0%
and need to upload proofs that they
should

03:04:11.690 --> 03:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:04:13.630 --> 03:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
accept it
 
03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
from people who wish to only use free
 
03:04:21.290 --> 03:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
and open source programs and don't wish
 
03:04:23.929 --> 03:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
to use proprietary ones which should be
 
03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
pretty easy since
 
03:04:27.309 --> 03:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
um a lot of
 
03:04:30.410 --> 03:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
documents are done in
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
PDF format which
 
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah is a portable format and most
 
03:04:41.809 --> 03:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh most operating systems come with
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
built-in support for it and and
 
03:04:46.969 --> 03:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
including list web browsers as well
 
03:04:46.979 --> 03:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
including list web browsers as well
um

03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:49.190 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:50.750 --> 03:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
although you you just you do still see
 
03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.030 align:start position:0%
although you you just you do still see
um

03:04:56.030 --> 03:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:58.969 --> 03:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
you do still see some older websites
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
saying download Adobe Reader for this
 
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
PDF but um I I would think that those
 
03:05:09.110 --> 03:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
should be removed since they're kind of
 
03:05:10.969 --> 03:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
misleading since you don't actually need
 
03:05:13.309 --> 03:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
to use Adobe Reader
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
um to view PDFs um
 
03:05:16.080 --> 03:05:17.870 align:start position:0%
um to view PDFs um
uh

03:05:17.870 --> 03:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just the
 
03:05:24.889 --> 03:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
um one part about
 
03:05:24.899 --> 03:05:25.969 align:start position:0%
um one part about
um

03:05:25.969 --> 03:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
so the the problem with proprietary
 
03:05:30.769 --> 03:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
software is it's basically a way of
 
03:05:33.530 --> 03:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
giving big tech companies control over
 
03:05:36.170 --> 03:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
you and you know we're a very fiercely
 
03:05:38.690 --> 03:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
independent state here where we don't
 
03:05:40.370 --> 03:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
like other people telling us what to do
 
03:05:40.380 --> 03:05:41.870 align:start position:0%
like other people telling us what to do
and

03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:05:42.650 --> 03:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh there are people who um want to be
 
03:05:51.050 --> 03:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
able to Tinker with their software to
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
make changes with it so that they aren't
 
03:05:55.969 --> 03:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
being tracked or take taken advantage of
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
by the company that makes them and they
 
03:06:01.070 --> 03:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to interact with the
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
government just as easily as people
 
03:06:04.380 --> 03:06:05.150 align:start position:0%
government just as easily as people
um

03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:06.290 align:start position:0%
um
who

03:06:06.290 --> 03:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:06:09.889 --> 03:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
are okay with proprietary software and
 
03:06:09.899 --> 03:06:10.910 align:start position:0%
are okay with proprietary software and
um

03:06:10.910 --> 03:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:10.920 --> 03:06:12.170 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:06:12.170 --> 03:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:15.170 --> 03:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
yeah to give a few more examples
 
03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:16.190 align:start position:0%
yeah to give a few more examples
um

03:06:16.190 --> 03:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:16.200 --> 03:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:20.510 --> 03:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the with school school work for
 
03:06:24.889 --> 03:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
that that would just mean like if a
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
student wants to
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
type up their book report in LibreOffice
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
instead of word that
 
03:06:34.560 --> 03:06:35.450 align:start position:0%
instead of word that
um

03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:39.710 --> 03:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
that the school would then accept it in
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
that format too which
 
03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:43.670 align:start position:0%
that format too which
the

03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
the school wouldn't actually have to
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
change anything on their own end since
 
03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:50.389 align:start position:0%
change anything on their own end since
um

03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:52.969 --> 03:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
yeah this the same pro programs can open
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
it it would just
 
03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
mean a change in policies
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so yeah um
 
03:07:03.769 --> 03:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
one thing I've been ordered to is that
 
03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:04.849 align:start position:0%
one thing I've been ordered to is that
um

03:07:04.849 --> 03:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
there is a new fiscal note online that
 
03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
does not match the one that is printed
 
03:07:16.130 --> 03:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
um in the um paper copy that was
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
available at the um
 
03:07:22.730 --> 03:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
on the table there um I just like to
 
03:07:25.969 --> 03:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
note a few issues with it
 
03:07:29.090 --> 03:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so it still has the old title of this
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill on it um it says act prohibiting
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
with limited exception state agencies
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
from using proprietary software in
 
03:07:38.269 --> 03:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
interactions with public
 
03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah that was the old title but that
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
was not what my intent was I asked OLS
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
to change it because that was a major
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
sticking point of
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
last year's bill was that
 
03:07:54.050 --> 03:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
the government can't just go and change
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
all of the software it is itself that
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
easily so um
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um I think that there has been kind
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
of a misunderstanding here where
 
03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:08.330 align:start position:0%
of a misunderstanding here where
um

03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal note is based on
 
03:08:14.269 --> 03:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
03:08:14.279 --> 03:08:16.130 align:start position:0%
the idea that
um

03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:18.530 --> 03:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
the government would have to replace its
 
03:08:18.540 --> 03:08:19.809 align:start position:0%
the government would have to replace its
own software

03:08:19.809 --> 03:08:19.819 align:start position:0%
own software
 
03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
which is not what this bill does
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
um it also mentions stuff about
 
03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
State websites the state websites part
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
was a separate bill
 
03:08:36.650 --> 03:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
um it was one of the previous bills um
 
03:08:36.660 --> 03:08:38.090 align:start position:0%
um it was one of the previous bills um
that

03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:40.010 --> 03:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
um excuse me could you just concentrate
 
03:08:41.570 --> 03:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
um well yeah so I'm saying that the
 
03:08:45.889 --> 03:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal note here I mentioning it because
 
03:08:47.929 --> 03:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note attached to this bill is
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
referring to a previous bill that is not
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill so I would just oh thank you
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
so so we should not take it we should
 
03:08:59.330 --> 03:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
take it with a grain of salt yes
 
03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:01.250 align:start position:0%
take it with a grain of salt yes
so

03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:03.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah basically yeah just take the
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal nut with a grain of salt I have
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I managed to uh round up a few other
 
03:09:17.809 --> 03:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
free software supporters to come testify
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
with me today so they can go more into
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
depth on that um but for now I'll take
 
03:09:28.250 --> 03:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
any questions okay
 
03:09:30.769 --> 03:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lekkis and
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
then a bear thank you so uh I need some
 
03:09:37.130 --> 03:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
help you know better understanding what
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get at in this bill
 
03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
about so this is requiring people to run
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
proprietary software we dealt earlier
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
with JavaScript are there any
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
applications that the states requiring
 
03:09:50.570 --> 03:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
people proprietary applications to
 
03:09:52.130 --> 03:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
States for people requiring people to
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
run on their computers to access the
 
03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
websites or
 
03:09:58.610 --> 03:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
are there others dealing with uh you
 
03:10:00.170 --> 03:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
know document formats I mean are the
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
schools literally requiring it be word I
 
03:10:04.370 --> 03:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
actually use LibreOffice and I'm
 
03:10:06.650 --> 03:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
familiar with yeah it can generate PDFs
 
03:10:08.809 --> 03:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
so you know what
 
03:10:11.630 --> 03:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
what are cases where you know that the
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
government is requiring people to run a
 
03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
proprietary applications on their
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
computers well I mean I'm just
 
03:10:20.990 --> 03:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
remembering for when I was in school
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
some teachers were very specific of you
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
must submit in a DOT DOC format and when
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
when they were teaching um
 
03:10:33.650 --> 03:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
what yeah when they were teaching in the
 
03:10:36.830 --> 03:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
tech ed classes it was on how to use
 
03:10:39.370 --> 03:10:39.380 align:start position:0%
this proprietary software specifically
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
which we were required to was what was
 
03:10:45.290 --> 03:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
one of our requirements for something we
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
had to take as part of our curriculum
 
03:10:47.399 --> 03:10:48.769 align:start position:0%
had to take as part of our curriculum
right

03:10:48.769 --> 03:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
um follow-up follow-up yeah so I I mean
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
some of those formats like dot doc
 
03:10:55.130 --> 03:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
LibreOffice will generate I believe so
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
will various other free or open software
 
03:11:00.110 --> 03:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to understand is Are
 
03:11:02.650 --> 03:11:02.660 align:start position:0%
there specific examples today
 
03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
where interacting with the government
 
03:11:07.849 --> 03:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
requires you to run a proprietary
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
software on your own system other than
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
the JavaScript we dealt with earlier
 
03:11:12.899 --> 03:11:13.849 align:start position:0%
the JavaScript we dealt with earlier
um

03:11:13.849 --> 03:11:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
for when there is a remote attendance
 
03:11:20.269 --> 03:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
option for things
 
03:11:20.279 --> 03:11:21.410 align:start position:0%
option for things
um

03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
that remote attendance option is usually
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
Zoom which may be free cost wise but is
 
03:11:31.610 --> 03:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
still proprietary software so I would
 
03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
think that in
 
03:11:36.370 --> 03:11:36.380 align:start position:0%
cases where like say yeah if you have to
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
if the physical court is closed and you
 
03:11:42.410 --> 03:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
have to appear
 
03:11:44.809 --> 03:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
remotely that there should be a free
 
03:11:44.819 --> 03:11:46.849 align:start position:0%
remotely that there should be a free
software

03:11:46.849 --> 03:11:46.859 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
um alternative to zoom that people can
 
03:11:55.130 --> 03:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
use to appear in court
 
03:11:58.010 --> 03:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up okay that one
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
actually that makes sense are there any
 
03:12:01.849 --> 03:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
others that you're aware of
 
03:12:01.859 --> 03:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
others that you're aware of
um

03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.560 --> 03:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
those are the main ones I want to touch
 
03:12:15.230 --> 03:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
on myself I'm was talking with some of
 
03:12:17.450 --> 03:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
the other testifiers who are going to
 
03:12:19.250 --> 03:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
have their own examples
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so yeah not I'm going to try not to
 
03:12:30.349 --> 03:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
Gallagher thank you very much for your
 
03:12:35.690 --> 03:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
testimony if you could give us a few
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
more examples of my colleague
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis was just remarking
 
03:12:41.809 --> 03:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
but if we could do
 
03:12:44.809 --> 03:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
more of an understanding citizen of a
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
bear he said he doesn't have any more
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
examples he's waiting for the other
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
people to testify so if you could defer
 
03:12:53.389 --> 03:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
your question thank you
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
just representative Dolan and gerhardt
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
chair the the issue that that I'm
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about it something like the
 
03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
state requires rooms and meal Stacks to
 
03:13:11.150 --> 03:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
be paid
 
03:13:14.090 --> 03:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
um by users of of that of those
 
03:13:17.090 --> 03:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
utilities and you have to you have to
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
log on to the state system
 
03:13:21.530 --> 03:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
proprietary software that the state has
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
in order to pay the rooms in Middlesex
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
so how what would this
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation do to people that that want
 
03:13:34.490 --> 03:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
to log on and do and pay those those uh
 
03:13:36.889 --> 03:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
those fees and would it require the
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
state to incur a lot more costs to be
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
able to accommodate all kinds of uh
 
03:13:45.530 --> 03:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
individual software
 
03:13:47.809 --> 03:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:13:52.429 --> 03:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
I have not uh paid the rooms and meals
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
tax myself personally so I'm not too
 
03:13:58.130 --> 03:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
03:13:58.140 --> 03:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
familiar with
um

03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:07.250 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
Well yeah if it's a web-based interface
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
then I think that would fit more under
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
the one about JavaScript that
 
03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
the one about JavaScript that
um

03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
I introduced previously but if it's not
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
a web-based interface well then I I
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
guess I would need to
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
look at that in more detail to be able
 
03:14:34.610 --> 03:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.730 --> 03:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you virtually bear
 
03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the language in here required
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
to use proprietary software for any
 
03:14:46.969 --> 03:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
interaction with the government in just
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
playing off of this for one second when
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
you log your Miles when you walk in in
 
03:14:53.690 --> 03:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
the morning would that include that you
 
03:14:56.210 --> 03:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that
 
03:14:56.220 --> 03:14:57.710 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that
um

03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:57.720 --> 03:14:59.450 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:14:59.450 --> 03:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that the kiosks where uh you
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
log your miles should be built with
 
03:15:12.290 --> 03:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
um free software I think
 
03:15:14.570 --> 03:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that there should be an
 
03:15:14.580 --> 03:15:16.190 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that there should be an
alternative

03:15:16.190 --> 03:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:15:19.490 --> 03:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
um like we were able to file mileage
 
03:15:23.090 --> 03:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine previously with a paper
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
alternative and
 
03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:26.330 align:start position:0%
alternative and
um

03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think I think if
 
03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:31.130 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think I think if
um

03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:33.410 --> 03:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
yeah if it's impossible I if it's
 
03:15:37.730 --> 03:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
impossible to provide a free software
 
03:15:40.010 --> 03:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
alternative to the mileage kiosk
 
03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
sign-ins then I think
 
03:15:42.180 --> 03:15:42.769 align:start position:0%
sign-ins then I think
um

03:15:42.769 --> 03:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
the solution should be
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide a paper
 
03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:50.269 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide a paper
alternative

03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh thank you
 
03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
actually that my I was making an
 
03:15:57.050 --> 03:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
assumption may be incorrect and you can
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
correct me that this
 
03:16:04.010 --> 03:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I misrepresentative Gerhart
 
03:16:04.020 --> 03:16:06.110 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I misrepresentative Gerhart
that

03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:07.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:09.110 --> 03:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
that this was your concern and what this
 
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
bill was about was being required to run
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
proprietary software on your own
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
equipment your phone your computer or
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever whereas the kiosk that's not
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
the case so I mean if my question is if
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
you view this as applying that
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
expansively would that also apply let's
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
say to the uh the parking meter things
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
where you put your card or money in and
 
03:16:32.929 --> 03:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
you get a ticket to put on your on your
 
03:16:36.889 --> 03:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.899 --> 03:16:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I I guess that's a good point that
 
03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I guess could
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
use some
 
03:16:46.260 --> 03:16:47.690 align:start position:0%
use some
um

03:16:47.690 --> 03:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:50.269 --> 03:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
let me look at the
 
03:16:50.279 --> 03:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
let me look at the
language

03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:54.830 align:start position:0%
language
um

03:16:54.830 --> 03:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.370 --> 03:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.380 --> 03:17:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
um in the cases where it's not the
 
03:17:10.190 --> 03:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
user's own computer that that would fall
 
03:17:12.349 --> 03:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
um under the
 
03:17:15.050 --> 03:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
um exception for unless the agency has
 
03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
determined that proprietary software is
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
the only means available
 
03:17:23.570 --> 03:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
um since yeah that that only means
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
available because they
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
are the ones who put it there so um okay
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
what

03:17:37.010 --> 03:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
your main motivation here is it more
 
03:17:41.570 --> 03:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
concerned about corporations the tech
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
corporations are more concerned about
 
03:17:44.269 --> 03:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
the government who you worry about this
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
information falling into the hands of
 
03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:47.450 align:start position:0%
information falling into the hands of
exactly

03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:17:47.460 --> 03:17:49.309 align:start position:0%
exactly
um

03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:49.319 --> 03:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:54.230 --> 03:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the overlap between the two
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
worrying um going on here um I I think
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
that the government should not be
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
03:18:11.090 --> 03:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
private corporations
 
03:18:14.690 --> 03:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
um to do its
 
03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
to function
 
03:18:19.730 --> 03:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
it should be able to do its own business
 
03:18:26.809 --> 03:18:26.819 align:start position:0%
in a free and open manner that the
 
03:18:30.349 --> 03:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
citizens who uh who control the
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
government you know of the People by the
 
03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
people for the people
 
03:18:37.630 --> 03:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
um decide upon
 
03:18:40.429 --> 03:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:18:40.439 --> 03:18:41.450 align:start position:0%
rather than
um

03:18:41.450 --> 03:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
rather than having corporations make
 
03:18:47.210 --> 03:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
those decisions for the government
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.690 --> 03:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:19:04.969 --> 03:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
good morning ladies and gentlemen Madam
 
03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:09.050 align:start position:0%
good morning ladies and gentlemen Madam
chair

03:19:09.050 --> 03:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh I look at this bill as an opportunity
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
for people citizens to have access to
 
03:19:18.230 --> 03:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
the government in all forms
 
03:19:21.290 --> 03:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
is not to say What pro software the
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
government should be using in their
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
day-to-day and interactions with each
 
03:19:25.319 --> 03:19:26.389 align:start position:0%
day-to-day and interactions with each
other

03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:19:29.570 --> 03:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
I can give you a couple of examples
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
public libraries oftentimes have
 
03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
computers in them for people that do not
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
have access to the internet do not have
 
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
access to computers
 
03:19:41.809 --> 03:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
they can go into the library they can
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
use a computer perhaps to look for jobs
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps to interact with the government
 
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
in some way shape or form
 
03:19:52.190 --> 03:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
if you require these libraries to buy
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
proprietary software
 
03:19:58.490 --> 03:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
then that puts a fiscal issue for them
 
03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
as well as a license management issue
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
that typically doesn't happen when you
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
use free software
 
03:20:07.849 --> 03:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
so there is one example to allow
 
03:20:11.809 --> 03:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
libraries to use software and rely to
 
03:20:13.849 --> 03:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
standards which we should be using
 
03:20:18.849 --> 03:20:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
libraries are not the subject of this
 
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill we're talking about State agencies
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am okay so could a library is not
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
a state agency that is true okay thank
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
you however the states
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
using software that forces a citizen to
 
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
use proprietary software when they're
 
03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
only access to it is through a public
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
library is a state problem
 
03:20:46.730 --> 03:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
ah thank you I'm glad I could clarify
 
03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
ah thank you I'm glad I could clarify
that

03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
the other thing about this bill is a an
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
example of schools
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
so he can high school has kind of
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
concentrated themselves on using Apple
 
03:20:57.180 --> 03:20:58.370 align:start position:0%
concentrated themselves on using Apple
software

03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:21:01.429 --> 03:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
and an apple networking environment
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
if the school says well in order to go
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
here you have to buy an Apple computer
 
03:21:09.290 --> 03:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
because that interacts with it and that
 
03:21:11.330 --> 03:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
keeps people from buying a Microsoft
 
03:21:13.730 --> 03:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
based computer or keeps people from
 
03:21:16.190 --> 03:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
buying using free software in order to
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
interact with the network that is not
 
03:21:21.230 --> 03:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
also a good thing
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
another example of this is and and what
 
03:21:27.050 --> 03:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
I would like to to say too especially
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal impact statement of the
 
03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
online copy of this
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that should be looking
 
03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
towards the future and not the past
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
so when you create a new RFP for a new
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
software that you're going to put as a
 
03:21:45.410 --> 03:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
state system you should say in that RFP
 
03:21:48.410 --> 03:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be able to operate with
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
free software into citizens hands
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not saying anything about
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the interactions of of systems that are
 
03:21:59.690 --> 03:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
used by employees of the state
 
03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about software that causes
 
03:22:05.090 --> 03:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
an interaction of a citizen with the
 
03:22:05.100 --> 03:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
an interaction of a citizen with the
state

03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's about it thank you very
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
much for listening to me oh one more
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
thing the fiscal impact of implementing
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
this should be very minimal I don't have
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
any idea as to the numbers of systems
 
03:22:24.650 --> 03:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
that might be affected however when you
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
go for an upgrade to that system or when
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
you go for extending the licenses of
 
03:22:32.570 --> 03:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
those systems you could make this a
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
requirement of the company that produced
 
03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
that system and that's what I think is
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
most important thank you thank you are
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think my guy who was testifying walked
 
03:22:46.920 --> 03:22:48.050 align:start position:0%
I think my guy who was testifying walked
away

03:22:48.050 --> 03:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:22:48.060 --> 03:22:51.230 align:start position:0%
away
oh

03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay we're gonna drag you back
 
03:22:56.760 --> 03:22:59.450 align:start position:0%
that's okay we're gonna drag you back
um

03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
what I'm running through my mind I'm I'm
 
03:23:04.490 --> 03:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
intrigued by this bill and interested
 
03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:06.469 align:start position:0%
intrigued by this bill and interested
and

03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:08.929 --> 03:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for some examples as I'm
 
03:23:12.050 --> 03:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
running this through my mind
 
03:23:15.410 --> 03:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
also to make sure that we don't trip a
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
Wire by having something that closes a
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
door on us either right
 
03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:21.650 align:start position:0%
door on us either right
um

03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
so I started to say like the the zoom
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
meetings the teams meeting I I've been
 
03:23:27.590 --> 03:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
in those situations where somebody sent
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
you an invite and it's on
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
let's say it's on teams
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to log in I gotta go
 
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
figure out I Gotta Go download the damn
 
03:23:39.170 --> 03:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
thing and then get get that going right
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
so I get where we're going but I'm
 
03:23:44.330 --> 03:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
looking for some some examples so I'm
 
03:23:44.340 --> 03:23:45.229 align:start position:0%
looking for some some examples so I'm
thinking

03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:23:45.239 --> 03:23:47.870 align:start position:0%
thinking
unemployment

03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:49.070 align:start position:0%
unemployment
um

03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:52.190 --> 03:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking when I have to upload a
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
picture of a certificate or something
 
03:23:57.469 --> 03:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
that it's got to be in a JPG I've got it
 
03:23:58.630 --> 03:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
in a PNG
 
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
IGS right nope that doesn't work that
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't work so I was looking for some
 
03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
good solid examples thank you sorry for
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
the long question
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
well we'll take the first one uh jitsi
 
03:24:14.929 --> 03:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
is a piece of software that allows you
 
03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
to do a video conference and it works
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
under any w3c compliant browser so you
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
can do it on edge you can do it on
 
03:24:29.530 --> 03:24:29.540 align:start position:0%
um on Firefox you can do it on Chrome
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
and that would be an alternative to
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
using Zoom
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
um you don't need to log in you don't
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
need to have an account you can just
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
fire it up
 
03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:41.870 align:start position:0%
fire it up
um

03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
so that would be one example
 
03:24:43.979 --> 03:24:45.710 align:start position:0%
so that would be one example
uh

03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
I have certain doctors forums I work
 
03:24:52.250 --> 03:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
with that they don't accept a JPEG and
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
they don't accept a PNG and they don't
 
03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
accept you know they only accept a PDF
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's fine because I know how to
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
generate those but it's often awkward
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
because the input that I have is in that
 
03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:05.150 align:start position:0%
because the input that I have is in that
format

03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
format
 
03:25:08.929 --> 03:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
so you know again we should be looking
 
03:25:11.450 --> 03:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
to be expansive and to try and take in
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
as many types of things as possible as
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to being restrictive
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question
 
03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:19.849 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question
okay

03:25:19.849 --> 03:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see any thank you representative
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
assignment sorry you said jitsy is that
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
correct Gypsy can you spell that for me
 
03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:30.290 align:start position:0%
correct Gypsy can you spell that for me
j-i-t-s-i

03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
j-i-t-s-i
 
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:38.210 --> 03:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.130 --> 03:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:25:41.809 --> 03:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dennis Goddard I
 
03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
live in Hopkinton I wanted to say just a
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
couple of um points related to the bill
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's already been
 
03:25:50.690 --> 03:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
noted that the the fiscal note is
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably way off base
 
03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
probably way off base
um

03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
I I would say what this bill is kind of
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
asking for is an accessible entrance
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
to a building for those of us that Maybe
 
03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to use the normal one
 
03:26:09.650 --> 03:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
the bill for that work I would expect to
 
03:26:11.809 --> 03:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
be making an accessible entrance maybe a
 
03:26:13.729 --> 03:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
ramp maybe a doorknob I wouldn't expect
 
03:26:15.469 --> 03:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
the bill to be we have to replace the
 
03:26:15.479 --> 03:26:16.429 align:start position:0%
the bill to be we have to replace the
house

03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay you don't need a new building
 
03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
and so by that analogy I want to talk
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
about what we're talking about here um
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the people that um
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
worked back in Silicon Valley during the
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
late 90s and early Arts I'm one of the
 
03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
army of people that worked so damn hard
 
03:26:40.429 --> 03:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
during that time to make it possible to
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
have the web that we now have for those
 
03:26:45.769 --> 03:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
who don't remember there was a war I
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
mean it was bad it was brutal
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
um where some companies wanted to
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
dictate exactly how the web was going to
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
work and not necessarily publish the
 
03:26:54.359 --> 03:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
work and not necessarily publish the
details

03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
details
 
03:26:58.570 --> 03:26:58.580 align:start position:0%
and really what made the internet
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
explode and happen and useful for
 
03:27:03.769 --> 03:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
everybody was that it's uh what we call
 
03:27:06.170 --> 03:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
Open Standards
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
you could go to any place and read like
 
03:27:10.670 --> 03:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
an academic paper here's exactly how
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to work here's my computer
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the data it's going to send to you
 
03:27:16.010 --> 03:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
and your computer the data we expected
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
to get back and
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
the the way to exchange the data and
 
03:27:21.530 --> 03:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's all laid out and anyone can read it
 
03:27:22.969 --> 03:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
and write their own the idea was you
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
make your own best implementation you
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
might have a proprietary server that's
 
03:27:26.220 --> 03:27:27.469 align:start position:0%
might have a proprietary server that's
better

03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:27:28.969 --> 03:27:28.979 align:start position:0%
um but you're talking the same language
 
03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
that anyone else can talk that's how we
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
made the internet where all our
 
03:27:33.889 --> 03:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
computers could talk together
 
03:27:36.050 --> 03:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you all mostly will be familiar with
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
HTML which anyone can like look at HTML
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
and like if you've done a little reading
 
03:27:41.690 --> 03:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
you can understand there's books you can
 
03:27:43.490 --> 03:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
read or whatever you can look up okay if
 
03:27:45.410 --> 03:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
I have an angle bracket and a b and then
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
an end angle bracket means there's going
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be bold okay it's not like a secret
 
03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
to be bold okay it's not like a secret
um

03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:54.650 --> 03:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
one more example just to make it a
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
little more clear I think for folks most
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
people are familiar with Microsoft Word
 
03:28:01.130 --> 03:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Office
 
03:28:01.140 --> 03:28:02.330 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Office
um

03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
starting some years ago you may have
 
03:28:05.809 --> 03:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
noticed that the extension changed when
 
03:28:07.729 --> 03:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
you save the file sometimes it used to
 
03:28:11.330 --> 03:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
be say a PPT file or a dot doc file now
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
you see it's a DOT pptx or a DOT docx
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
and you go whatever seems to work the X
 
03:28:20.090 --> 03:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
actually stands for XML which is kind of
 
03:28:22.729 --> 03:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
like an HTML thing long and short of it
 
03:28:24.530 --> 03:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
is it's an open standard it's published
 
03:28:26.929 --> 03:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
it's out there any one that's like in
 
03:28:29.809 --> 03:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
the field can easily see oh okay this is
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
the format of the document here's how I
 
03:28:33.530 --> 03:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
read it here's what that stuff means is
 
03:28:35.330 --> 03:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
this is bold this is italic here's a
 
03:28:35.340 --> 03:28:36.469 align:start position:0%
this is bold this is italic here's a
paragraph

03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:28:36.479 --> 03:28:37.309 align:start position:0%
paragraph
Etc

03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:28:39.170 --> 03:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
and that's what makes it possible for
 
03:28:41.450 --> 03:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
open source code to do stuff like open
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
Word documents read them and send you a
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
Word document as far as you know yeah
 
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
and so again what this what I read this
 
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
Bill is saying is what I think is
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
motivating some of us to show up here
 
03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:52.250 align:start position:0%
motivating some of us to show up here
today

03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:28:54.170 --> 03:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
um is that we're the sort of honestly
 
03:28:56.570 --> 03:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
conscientious objectors
 
03:28:56.580 --> 03:28:57.229 align:start position:0%
conscientious objectors
um

03:28:57.229 --> 03:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:00.530 --> 03:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
look I I work in in again the it field I
 
03:29:02.450 --> 03:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
do a lot with security lately I work at
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
a very large database company as it
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
turns out probably the kind of company
 
03:29:06.830 --> 03:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
that most of the people behind me do not
 
03:29:08.750 --> 03:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
want to do business with but yet here I
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
am reading a paycheck
 
03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
um at least I'm not here running a
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
paycheck but I mean I I'm employed there
 
03:29:16.490 --> 03:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
but the point is one thing I've learned
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
keeping data safe
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
is that the internet and if there's one
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
thing I I want to impart to you today
 
03:29:25.610 --> 03:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's open source or not the
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
internet is an adversarial environment
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's a war and it has been for at least
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
a decade and it's not even two sides it
 
03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's not like um good guys and bad guys
 
03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's just an open chaos field and it's
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
non-stop 24 7. it's on every Internet
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
connected device that you own most of
 
03:29:45.050 --> 03:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
the time you don't see it because
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that would show it to
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
you because it's not going to help you
 
03:29:49.490 --> 03:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
to see how many times you're trying to
 
03:29:50.570 --> 03:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
be hacked
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
every day
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
um that's not so much the point well the
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
point is that those of us who are really
 
03:29:59.030 --> 03:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
involved with with this stuff tend to be
 
03:30:01.490 --> 03:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
those who are most concerned
 
03:30:01.500 --> 03:30:02.210 align:start position:0%
those who are most concerned
um

03:30:02.210 --> 03:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:05.929 --> 03:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
I again being involved very deeply in in
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
the space of large data
 
03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:08.870 align:start position:0%
the space of large data
um

03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't use Windows at home no way my
 
03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
employer gives me a phone
 
03:30:17.210 --> 03:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
um that they have their proprietary
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
software on so I can you know work
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
remotely and stuff but my personal phone
 
03:30:25.849 --> 03:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
is neither uh Google nor Apple thank you
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
very much it's an open Hardware an Open
 
03:30:30.050 --> 03:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
Source phone with switches on it that I
 
03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
can flick that say like it's physically
 
03:30:34.849 --> 03:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
disconnected the camera is not on
 
03:30:34.859 --> 03:30:35.690 align:start position:0%
disconnected the camera is not on
um

03:30:35.690 --> 03:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:37.090 --> 03:30:37.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
I realize that's not everybody and
 
03:30:41.450 --> 03:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
certainly those of us in a weird little
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'll call it religious minority for the
 
03:30:44.929 --> 03:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
sake of a better term and I want to come
 
03:30:46.490 --> 03:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
back to that momentarily
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
um we're not trying to make everyone
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
comport to our particular weirdness
 
03:30:51.840 --> 03:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
comport to our particular weirdness
um but

03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
I do think that it's fairly well
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
established and the way that we want to
 
03:30:59.210 --> 03:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
have our civil society um that there are
 
03:31:01.490 --> 03:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience that are really at
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
the base even of the religious freedoms
 
03:31:06.769 --> 03:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
that um those in the faith-based
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
community enjoy they're all based in
 
03:31:10.429 --> 03:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
these rights of conscience not all of
 
03:31:13.370 --> 03:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
which are specifically about
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
um faith we have also bits in our
 
03:31:17.450 --> 03:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
constitution about things like those who
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
are really scrupulous in avoiding the
 
03:31:24.170 --> 03:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
use of weapons not being conscripted in
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
a war
 
03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
I use that war analogy for a reason
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm very scrupulous in my personal
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
life I know some people aren't you know
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
we're the Quakers it's cool you don't
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
have to come into our meetings
 
03:31:38.330 --> 03:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't use this stuff I don't
 
03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
want to I understand how big the machine
 
03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
is and how little it's in control and
 
03:31:44.570 --> 03:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
how little faith I have that any
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
government is going to get it under
 
03:31:49.610 --> 03:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
control how little uh how much I know
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
how many governments and
 
03:31:57.309 --> 03:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh Oregon companies are
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
far too involved in each other so here
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
here's what I want to leave you with
 
03:32:04.080 --> 03:32:05.630 align:start position:0%
here's what I want to leave you with
um

03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for is just to make
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
sure that when government puts something
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
up and it doesn't have to retroactively
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
immediately be everything that we've
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
ever done but like can we let
 
03:32:18.410 --> 03:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
towns know can we let the state
 
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
government know you're about to roll out
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
some piece of whatever
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
um make sure it's Open Standards right
 
03:32:27.229 --> 03:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
if you're going to stream something and
 
03:32:29.389 --> 03:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you feel it necessary to stream it
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know look at open source options if
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
they're available at all don't don't
 
03:32:35.450 --> 03:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
make us
 
03:32:38.570 --> 03:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
use them um you know sometimes there's
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
there's cheap ways to do stuff like you
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
want to stream stuff on YouTube and it's
 
03:32:45.050 --> 03:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
really easy for most people there are
 
03:32:46.729 --> 03:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
little things you can do I I personally
 
03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
set up what's called an invidious
 
03:32:51.170 --> 03:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
instance for my uh family and friends
 
03:32:53.690 --> 03:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
um that lets me use YouTube without
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
YouTube collecting the data of those who
 
03:32:57.530 --> 03:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
use YouTube
 
03:32:57.540 --> 03:32:59.870 align:start position:0%
use YouTube
um

03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.229 --> 03:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
again it it's really not about
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
finding every piece of proprietary
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
software and getting rid of it it's just
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
making sure that government doesn't
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
require me as a taxpayer as a user to
 
03:33:13.130 --> 03:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
install some piece of software use a
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
piece of software that was created by an
 
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
organization that won't show me the
 
03:33:19.370 --> 03:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
source code or doesn't publish its
 
03:33:21.769 --> 03:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
interfaces so that others
 
03:33:21.779 --> 03:33:22.610 align:start position:0%
interfaces so that others
um

03:33:22.610 --> 03:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:25.550 --> 03:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
can can play in the same space
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
um that that's why one last thing I'm
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
sorry web browsers web browsers this was
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
the whole War I was talking about in the
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
90s and early Arts um the reason that it
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what web browser you use
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
when you go to any website that was a
 
03:33:39.050 --> 03:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
big thing if you remember the little
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
icon you'd see on some websites like
 
03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
this site best viewed in any browser
 
03:33:44.690 --> 03:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
because at the time Microsoft really
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
wanted you to use the Microsoft
 
03:33:49.130 --> 03:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
um Internet Explorer browser that they
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually just got that they just
 
03:33:51.769 --> 03:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
de-supported which is one of the reasons
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
that some of us are really concerned
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
about these things Open Standards don't
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
go away because some company isn't
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
finding them profitable anymore
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
um so yeah please do don't take this to
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
be you have to get rid of the whole
 
03:34:04.130 --> 03:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
house please take this to be for those
 
03:34:05.690 --> 03:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
of us are really scrupulous about these
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
things we'd like an alternate entrance
 
03:34:09.290 --> 03:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
or maybe the default entrance to be one
 
03:34:10.490 --> 03:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
that everyone
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
can use with where the standards are
 
03:34:23.570 --> 03:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.570 --> 03:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
my my own twin brother was in the
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
military he was saying actually the
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
government runs Linux on the computers
 
03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
that control the missiles because he was
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
over in hungry messing with that so I
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
understand the concept and personally I
 
03:34:36.889 --> 03:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
use Linux myself on home and lineage on
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of my cell phones but what I'm
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about is somebody that is also
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
on the committee that was talking about
 
03:34:44.690 --> 03:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
the fact is no there's no support or
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
upkeep or upgrades to this open source
 
03:34:48.170 --> 03:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
software how do you deal with that so
 
03:34:49.729 --> 03:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
the state says we're going to have this
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
system doing this all of a sudden you
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
guys get bored you move on to a new
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
project nobody's up keeping the thing
 
03:34:58.130 --> 03:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
what do we do I mentioned that my
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
company is responsible for some of the
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
largest databases in the world the ones
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
that have all of your cell phone records
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
all of your financial records um the big
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
companies choose our database to store
 
03:35:11.450 --> 03:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
your stuff in and they store their stuff
 
03:35:13.849 --> 03:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
on Linux servers most of most of them
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
and my team are 24 7 Around the Clock in
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
some uh time zone it's it's noon
 
03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:21.410 align:start position:0%
some uh time zone it's it's noon
somewhere

03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:35:24.050 --> 03:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and they're helping our customers fix
 
03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
any problem they have uh in in short the
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
assertion that there isn't support is in
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
fact a not correct one there are many
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
many in fact there is a diversity
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
of consultancies that are more than
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
willing to provide support to open
 
03:35:42.170 --> 03:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
source software and that diversity and
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
and ecosystem and dare I say capitalist
 
03:35:48.410 --> 03:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
incentive is there because
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh the standards are open and uh people
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
can compete on providing good service at
 
03:35:54.769 --> 03:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
a good price
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you hey Dennis good to see you
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
again uh I understand the philosophical
 
03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
or as you put it religious View and I'm
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
sort of part of that religion although
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
probably not as Orthodox
 
03:36:09.070 --> 03:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
um as you but to help us with this bill
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
I mean statute has to be pretty specific
 
03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
we can't we're not generally writing
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
General philosophy so it's kind of
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
related to the questions I asked before
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
um we had the example of Zoom we had the
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
example of schools maybe requiring
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
certain Hardware I get that
 
03:36:25.979 --> 03:36:26.570 align:start position:0%
certain Hardware I get that
um

03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
but some of these uh formats at this
 
03:36:31.130 --> 03:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
point I don't know of any that you know
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
open source software won't generate as
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
far as uploading documents for example
 
03:36:38.990 --> 03:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for and this also is to help
 
03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:39.769 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for and this also is to help
us

03:36:39.769 --> 03:36:39.779 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:36:41.809 --> 03:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
make some assessment of the fiscal note
 
03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
if it makes any sense and so the
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
question is what examples are there
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
where people are required to use
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
proprietary software to interact with
 
03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
the state government sure um you've
 
03:36:57.290 --> 03:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
opened a very
 
03:36:59.210 --> 03:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
easy and interesting one
 
03:37:01.490 --> 03:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
um you know my children had to use zoom
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh in in their schools I wasn't thrilled
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
about it but there you go
 
03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:07.250 align:start position:0%
about it but there you go
um

03:37:07.250 --> 03:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:13.010 --> 03:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
I fear a time when my uh whether it's my
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
town or the state of New Hampshire tells
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
me that to either pay a tax or pay a
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
ticket or pay for the parking whatever
 
03:37:24.050 --> 03:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
that I can download an app that works in
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
either apple or iOS
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
it's almost like being able to vote both
 
03:37:31.849 --> 03:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
Republican and Democrat and asking why
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's any problem
 
03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
there's any problem
um

03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
but I definitely hear the concern
 
03:37:41.210 --> 03:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
I I
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know I'm very grateful that you guys
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
are professional at the use of language
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
to craft
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
um desired policy outcome because I I'm
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
not sure how to go about doing so
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
um in a way I want examples
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
um but in a way you know
 
03:37:58.729 --> 03:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
um but but I hear the need for
 
03:37:58.739 --> 03:38:00.469 align:start position:0%
um but but I hear the need for
specificity

03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
specificity
 
03:38:00.479 --> 03:38:01.309 align:start position:0%
specificity
um

03:38:01.309 --> 03:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:04.490 --> 03:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
so I think that there clearly needs to
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
be some language to clarify things for
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
the the general audience and for the um
 
03:38:12.650 --> 03:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
for the organizations and state
 
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
organizations that will have to
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether they're compliant or
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
what they have to do
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion is that there ought
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
to be a study committee frankly but I'm
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
not a legislator but I I will say I
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
could tell your lack of Orthodoxy
 
03:38:26.750 --> 03:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
um right away just from the general
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean
 
03:38:33.710 --> 03:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can whatever happens
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
to this bill I'll be glad to work with
 
03:38:37.849 --> 03:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
you and Rob Gallagher to maybe talk
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
about options and get ideas anyway thank
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
president Dolan and the neighbor
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned about Costa government
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so my question is go back to the
 
03:38:55.130 --> 03:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
what I raised earlier about
 
03:38:56.929 --> 03:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
interfacing with the with the
 
03:38:58.490 --> 03:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
proprietary software that the state has
 
03:39:00.769 --> 03:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
to pay your rooms and meal stacks
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to to
 
03:39:05.870 --> 03:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
03:39:07.969 --> 03:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
if I just tore off a piece of paper and
 
03:39:09.889 --> 03:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
said I don't want to interface with your
 
03:39:12.050 --> 03:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
software so I'm going to submit a piece
 
03:39:14.929 --> 03:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
of paper with my end scratch on it that
 
03:39:16.490 --> 03:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
it would cost the government a lot more
 
03:39:18.410 --> 03:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
money to process that piece of paper
 
03:39:20.410 --> 03:39:20.420 align:start position:0%
than to
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
allow the auditor to have the individual
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
put these the information into the to
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
the proprietary software what do what do
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
we do in in uh in that case in a
 
03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
situation how do we prevent the cost of
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
government growing in order to
 
03:39:37.800 --> 03:39:38.990 align:start position:0%
government growing in order to
accommodate

03:39:38.990 --> 03:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
what's being suggested sure thank you
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
for the question and as a person who
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
might you know one of the teams my team
 
03:39:46.190 --> 03:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
and sometimes I have to do is we we
 
03:39:47.809 --> 03:39:47.819 align:start position:0%
actually process tickets they're they're
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
not for parking fines that someone has a
 
03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
problem and there's a ticket and it
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
comes to us and the ones that cost us
 
03:39:54.769 --> 03:39:54.779 align:start position:0%
the most are those weird one-off ones
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
right if if there was a standardization
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
we could process 10 000 times the amount
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
but like it's the weird one-offs that
 
03:40:01.849 --> 03:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
cost you right it's like very much hear
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
the guy with the strange request and the
 
03:40:08.690 --> 03:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
torn off piece of paper fortunately I
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
think like like all analogies this one
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
breaks down at a certain point
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think the key here is not
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
necessarily to say that anyone can use
 
03:40:17.450 --> 03:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
any method that they want to use any
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
branch of government I mean we're not
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
saying you can come in and speak Swahili
 
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
for some purpose and expect that the
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
person behind the counter is going to
 
03:40:26.929 --> 03:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
have to help you but rather that when
 
03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
government is setting up these
 
03:40:31.210 --> 03:40:31.220 align:start position:0%
interfaces or setting up these systems
 
03:40:34.750 --> 03:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
typically it's not at all a uh
 
03:40:37.370 --> 03:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
a confusing or a Shades of Gray kind of
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
thing typically you've either got a
 
03:40:42.729 --> 03:40:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.010 --> 03:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
a check box that a provider or a company
 
03:40:47.809 --> 03:40:47.819 align:start position:0%
will say is well you know it conforms to
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
you know whatever open standard SSL V3
 
03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
or HTML5
 
03:40:53.700 --> 03:40:54.889 align:start position:0%
or HTML5
Etc

03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um which is why for example right our
 
03:40:58.729 --> 03:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
state government last I checked uh we're
 
03:41:00.250 --> 03:41:00.260 align:start position:0%
using IIs
 
03:41:03.290 --> 03:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
information Microsoft's web server for a
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
lot of things I don't have to use
 
03:41:06.410 --> 03:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
Microsoft in my browser because we're
 
03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
talking this common HTML language
 
03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and so we're not saying that we can
 
03:41:13.190 --> 03:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
literally go in and say I want to speak
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
a different language but that as long as
 
03:41:17.809 --> 03:41:17.819 align:start position:0%
your browser is set up so that HTML is
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
the lingua Franca and it's the published
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
HTML that we all mean we say HTML then
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
then there's no issue as opposed to well
 
03:41:27.050 --> 03:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
you have to use the Microsoft browser to
 
03:41:29.150 --> 03:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
go to this web page because that's the
 
03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:31.550 align:start position:0%
go to this web page because that's the
deal

03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.560 --> 03:41:35.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:35.229 --> 03:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so back to your
 
03:41:41.450 --> 03:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
original opening comment about we want
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
to replace the door not the building
 
03:41:43.439 --> 03:41:45.469 align:start position:0%
to replace the door not the building
analogy

03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
would it behoove us to have the bill
 
03:41:51.769 --> 03:41:51.779 align:start position:0%
State something that all new systems and
 
03:41:54.290 --> 03:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
renovated systems would be certified
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
through our I.T officer also sitting in
 
03:41:59.150 --> 03:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
the panel here today
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it's open source would
 
03:42:04.370 --> 03:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
that cover
 
03:42:06.889 --> 03:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for the question
 
03:42:08.570 --> 03:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
I I think that would go I I would love
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
that I think it would go a little
 
03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
farther than our choir I think a very
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
Central piece of of my personal
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
religiousness I never turned down a
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
small piece of cake
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
um if language is emitted so that um
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
open source should be you know
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
considered for any new systems that's
 
03:42:23.880 --> 03:42:24.769 align:start position:0%
considered for any new systems that's
great

03:42:24.769 --> 03:42:24.779 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
um and again I I think an important part
 
03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
of of this resubmit is that it doesn't
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
mandate that the sort that the state use
 
03:42:32.210 --> 03:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
open source it could very well be a
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
closed Source fully proprietary you know
 
03:42:36.769 --> 03:42:36.779 align:start position:0%
owned and maintained by Microsoft or
 
03:42:36.779 --> 03:42:37.729 align:start position:0%
owned and maintained by Microsoft or
whoever

03:42:37.729 --> 03:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
um but that those interfaces to the
 
03:42:39.420 --> 03:42:40.370 align:start position:0%
um but that those interfaces to the
public

03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
that those be Open Standards open
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
published standards
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:43:05.330 --> 03:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
um so let me give me a I'm so I'm
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
Christopher Wade uh from Keene New
 
03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:08.030 align:start position:0%
Christopher Wade uh from Keene New
Hampshire

03:43:08.030 --> 03:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
um I I own a small well fairly small
 
03:43:11.279 --> 03:43:12.170 align:start position:0%
um I I own a small well fairly small
business

03:43:12.170 --> 03:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
um that uh basically we sell hardware
 
03:43:16.969 --> 03:43:16.979 align:start position:0%
and I'm in the free software uh I do
 
03:43:18.889 --> 03:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
free software development um and I fund
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
free software development
 
03:43:23.210 --> 03:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
um a little bit about me
 
03:43:25.849 --> 03:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so I I probably have the most
 
03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
expertise in terms of uh dealing with
 
03:43:32.570 --> 03:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
non-technical users and free software
 
03:43:35.570 --> 03:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
systems as my company is the the leading
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
the leading retailer of computers
 
03:43:40.849 --> 03:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
basically uh to
 
03:43:43.010 --> 03:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
the world effectively
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and accessories for that matter
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh one of the things I want to
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
make a few comments on what is actually
 
03:43:53.090 --> 03:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna if you're gonna have
 
03:43:55.610 --> 03:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
something amended or changed here
 
03:43:57.769 --> 03:43:57.779 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it's not necessarily as
 
03:43:59.210 --> 03:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
far as this bill is concerned that
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything be open source or free
 
03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:01.490 align:start position:0%
everything be open source or free
software

03:44:01.490 --> 03:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:44:03.650 --> 03:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
um what matters is actually that the
 
03:44:07.969 --> 03:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
formats and the apis uh be open such
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
that users can interact with the
 
03:44:10.140 --> 03:44:11.330 align:start position:0%
that users can interact with the
government

03:44:11.330 --> 03:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:44:12.410 --> 03:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and ensure that the users can
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
interact all users can interact with the
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
government so
 
03:44:16.319 --> 03:44:17.210 align:start position:0%
government so
um

03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
so this is this is I want to talk a
 
03:44:21.769 --> 03:44:21.779 align:start position:0%
little about the costs here real quick
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
so this isn't really any different than
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
what's already uh already available the
 
03:44:29.090 --> 03:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
government's already doing in terms of
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
accommodating people with disabilities
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you know if if there's a program to
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
say for example submit and I don't know
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
enough about this specifically but
 
03:44:40.490 --> 03:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
submit uh rooms and meals tax to the
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
government they already are going to
 
03:44:43.010 --> 03:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
have to offer something for somebody
 
03:44:45.410 --> 03:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
who's disabled so this is not they
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really have any substantial
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
costs uh all it does is it effectively
 
03:44:53.150 --> 03:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
apply this what what people with
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities have already got to
 
03:44:55.680 --> 03:44:57.469 align:start position:0%
disabilities have already got to
everybody

03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:44:57.479 --> 03:44:58.250 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:58.260 --> 03:44:59.630 align:start position:0%
um
oh

03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:45:01.729 --> 03:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
so um one of the things about people
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
were talking about security so the
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
security thing the only people who are
 
03:45:07.370 --> 03:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
saying that there's like an issue there
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
I think are people who don't understand
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
free software and how it's developed so
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
canonical and IBM are basically two
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
companies that put out the leading
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
Enterprise uh distribution there's some
 
03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
others but leading Enterprise
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
distributions for for Linux and free
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
software and gnu and basically uh the
 
03:45:27.769 --> 03:45:27.779 align:start position:0%
way the way it works in the free
 
03:45:29.870 --> 03:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
software world is they're these
 
03:45:31.130 --> 03:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
basically companies are distributions
 
03:45:33.050 --> 03:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
and they maintain the software so you
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
get security updates you can get 10 to
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
12 years of security updates for
 
03:45:38.809 --> 03:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
basically almost any application that
 
03:45:40.370 --> 03:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
you would want to run on your system and
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
this doesn't matter if it's your web
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
browser like Firefox or you know Apache
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
web server or whatever
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
um so it's not it's not really it's not
 
03:45:51.530 --> 03:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
like in Windows where it is the other
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing it's not like in Windows or with
 
03:45:56.090 --> 03:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
apple you know if apple or Microsoft
 
03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
discontinues something you know you're
 
03:45:59.090 --> 03:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's it there's nothing you can do
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
about it if I'm if I am looking at
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
options this is one of the great things
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the free market and free software
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
is there's actually competition in the
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
market so if I'm looking at I don't know
 
03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
let's I'm trying to think of another
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
example Debian Debian uh is they've got
 
03:46:14.450 --> 03:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
sort of official support maintained for
 
03:46:16.370 --> 03:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
five years with their distribution well
 
03:46:17.809 --> 03:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
their distribution has most of the same
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
software that IBM's distribution and
 
03:46:22.490 --> 03:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
canonicals distribution have
 
03:46:23.990 --> 03:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
um but the difference is their support
 
03:46:26.150 --> 03:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
though how long that support lasts for
 
03:46:28.490 --> 03:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
security updates it's different so if
 
03:46:30.050 --> 03:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
you need something that's a long-term
 
03:46:31.849 --> 03:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
supported distribution you'd want to
 
03:46:33.530 --> 03:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
look at canonical or if you even need
 
03:46:34.849 --> 03:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
longer support you'd want to look at
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
something like red hat Enterprise links
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
from IBM
 
03:46:40.610 --> 03:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
all right um so my main concern though
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
here today is actually uh non-technical
 
03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
users it's usually non-technical users
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
who get stumped by you know issues when
 
03:46:51.170 --> 03:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
it comes to interfacing with governments
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
and schools and things like that
 
03:46:54.530 --> 03:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
um basically what this would do is it
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
would just make it easier for people to
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh when when problems occurred uh it
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for somebody to say hey
 
03:47:04.969 --> 03:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
wait a minute teach you got to give me
 
03:47:08.210 --> 03:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
another way to submit my my my paper
 
03:47:09.530 --> 03:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
that I might have to submit maybe that's
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
on maybe physically hand them a paper or
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know submit it in an ODT file it
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually the bill doesn't it's
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's saying mandate right they can't
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
mandate these proprietary software so
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you know it doesn't
 
03:47:23.450 --> 03:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
mean it even has to be it just means
 
03:47:24.769 --> 03:47:24.779 align:start position:0%
there has to be they have to offer you
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
another option if you have an issue
 
03:47:27.239 --> 03:47:32.389 align:start position:0%
another option if you have an issue
um

03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
so one of the other things is without
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's important for security from like an
 
03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
end user standpoint uh that their source
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
is available and
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
it you know a lot of people here are
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
talking about it from like a technical
 
03:47:45.170 --> 03:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
standpoint but this is actually more
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
concerning to me from an end user
 
03:47:48.530 --> 03:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
standpoint Because unless free software
 
03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
developers can look at the source code
 
03:47:53.210 --> 03:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
and not just the people who wrote it you
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
can't really even begin to have a
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
conversation about security
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and you can't begin to have a secure
 
03:47:59.570 --> 03:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
system one of the things you'll never
 
03:48:03.290 --> 03:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
hear is a new Linux user saying oh I was
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
infected by you know malware X or you
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
know virus X you just you can't get
 
03:48:10.849 --> 03:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
infected when the distribution when you
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a distribution you've got your
 
03:48:13.849 --> 03:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
security updates up to date there is no
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
antivirus for Linux except for antivirus
 
03:48:18.889 --> 03:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
that stands for Windows viruses
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
um and this is something I think people
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
fail to understand about security like
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
the general population it's it's it's
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
because the way proprietary software is
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
developed that we have security issues
 
03:48:30.650 --> 03:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
it's not that there aren't bugs in free
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
software there are but they're fixed and
 
03:48:34.190 --> 03:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
they can be fixed and there's
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
competition in the market that ensures
 
03:48:38.210 --> 03:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
those security issues get resolved
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir I think you're you're
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
drifting from the bill in question could
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
you wrap it up all the points I've made
 
03:48:54.050 --> 03:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
were specifically related to what we've
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
03:48:57.410 --> 03:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
um that were asked questions
 
03:48:57.420 --> 03:49:01.969 align:start position:0%
um that were asked questions
um

03:49:01.969 --> 03:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.290 --> 03:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
so uh the other thing I want to point
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
out is that proprietary software is
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
actually already undermining people's
 
03:49:08.929 --> 03:49:08.939 align:start position:0%
with people with disabilities access to
 
03:49:10.849 --> 03:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
government services
 
03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
um just as an example
 
03:49:14.090 --> 03:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
um so I'm actually going to give you an
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
example for people who are getting like
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
welfare and things like that um that
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
people wanted an example of where this
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually hinders people today
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and that is with what welfare
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
basically I'm not sure exactly it's true
 
03:49:28.010 --> 03:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
at the state level or not but I know I
 
03:49:29.150 --> 03:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
believe it's at least at the federal
 
03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:30.229 align:start position:0%
believe it's at least at the federal
level

03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:49:32.210 --> 03:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
um there are some benefits and I'm not
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure specifically welfare specifically
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
it might be more like Social Security
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
but there are certain things that you
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
have to fill out and it has to be with
 
03:49:40.250 --> 03:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
Adobe Reader it cannot be with a free
 
03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
PDF reader
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's a good example
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
um Court ordering monitoring software is
 
03:49:49.190 --> 03:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
another good example and again I I'm not
 
03:49:51.530 --> 03:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not that familiar with state New
 
03:49:52.849 --> 03:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically I only know
 
03:49:54.530 --> 03:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
people who have had this happen at the
 
03:49:56.929 --> 03:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
federal level but it's not unlikely that
 
03:49:59.210 --> 03:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
their State uh there's something state
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
level equivalent of uh monitoring
 
03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:03.349 align:start position:0%
level equivalent of uh monitoring
software

03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:50:04.969 --> 03:50:04.979 align:start position:0%
um devices like parking meters are often
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
mechanical not and they're not dependent
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
on software so it's not actually a
 
03:50:10.610 --> 03:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
software problem in most cases
 
03:50:12.530 --> 03:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and this bill probably would have no
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
effect on it as far as I can see
 
03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:19.429 align:start position:0%
effect on it as far as I can see
um

03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
so another example of where government
 
03:50:21.239 --> 03:50:22.370 align:start position:0%
so another example of where government
forces

03:50:22.370 --> 03:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
forces
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
users to run proprietary software on
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
their own computer is submitting
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.610 --> 03:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay something else that's important to
 
03:50:33.410 --> 03:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
note is
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
a end user license agreement is
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
something that you agree to Simply by
 
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
using the software
 
03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
um it's really messed up that government
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
can tell you that you have to agree to
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
Microsoft's terms in order to use
 
03:50:49.610 --> 03:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Word or Microsoft Windows or
 
03:50:51.170 --> 03:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you're you're effectively forcing
 
03:50:54.889 --> 03:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
somebody to agree to a contract that
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't necessarily agree to
 
03:50:59.210 --> 03:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm not even sure how that that's
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
legal but
 
03:51:00.600 --> 03:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
legal but
anyway

03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's that's what I have to
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
say on there if anybody has any
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be more than happy to
 
03:51:08.290 --> 03:51:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative gerhardt all right thank
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair you said that there are
 
03:51:16.969 --> 03:51:16.979 align:start position:0%
free market pressures on open source
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
developers to maintain their software
 
03:51:21.290 --> 03:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
and to keep it free what yes when I when
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
I downloaded Linux it was free so what
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
free market where's the motive oh yeah
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty simple
 
03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:29.150 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty simple
um

03:51:29.150 --> 03:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:31.010 --> 03:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
so there's competition in the
 
03:51:32.570 --> 03:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
marketplace there's different versions
 
03:51:34.849 --> 03:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
of Linux and it may be that your version
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
of Linux I don't know what do you do
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
what you do you know what you what
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're currently cinnamon okay one
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
expand I'm assuming um so Linux Mint has
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
support for three to five years
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
basically you're not going to get
 
03:51:47.809 --> 03:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
security updates for more than five
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
years you have to move off of it after
 
03:51:53.450 --> 03:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
five years if you want uh if you want to
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
have security updates for say you know
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
10 years or 12 years you would have to
 
03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
use something like red hat Enterprise
 
03:52:02.690 --> 03:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
Linux or
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm trying to think some of the
 
03:52:07.969 --> 03:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
others uh uh Ubuntu that's fine I just
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
one follow-up and then thank you and
 
03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
those are Commercial Services that
 
03:52:14.330 --> 03:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
they're offering you understand those
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
those ladder Commercial Services that
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are those are those
 
03:52:19.190 --> 03:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
open source themselves yeah
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
I just don't see how you can sell
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
something when it's open source the
 
03:52:23.090 --> 03:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
information's out there okay um so
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm good I'm good okay you could
 
03:52:25.969 --> 03:52:25.979 align:start position:0%
buy all the parts for a car and build it
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
yourself or you could pay somebody for a
 
03:52:31.570 --> 03:52:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:34.849 --> 03:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I don't see any
 
03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.150 --> 03:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
so I am Ben
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a computer science PhD student at
 
03:52:53.570 --> 03:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College uh and my area of
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
research is cyber security
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh with free software you can see how it
 
03:52:58.969 --> 03:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
works and with proprietary software you
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
can't so that's like not being able to
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
pop the hood of your car uh so with zoom
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh they've had a really bad privacy and
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
security track record uh they claimed to
 
03:53:11.090 --> 03:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
use end-to-end encryption and then it
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
turned out that they were
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
lying about that and that really they
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
meant there's only encryption between
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
the users and zoom's servers which is
 
03:53:23.090 --> 03:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
employed almost almost every web service
 
03:53:24.769 --> 03:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
works that way so that's like every scam
 
03:53:26.570 --> 03:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the Internet is end-to-end encrypted
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
if that's your definition of end-to-end
 
03:53:27.960 --> 03:53:29.389 align:start position:0%
if that's your definition of end-to-end
encrypt

03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
encrypt
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
um free software doesn't have this issue
 
03:53:34.729 --> 03:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
because public code can be independently
 
03:53:34.739 --> 03:53:36.349 align:start position:0%
because public code can be independently
verified

03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
verified
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why I think I should not be
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
made to use proprietary software in my
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
interactions with the government
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you that's well stated any
 
03:53:45.239 --> 03:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you that's well stated any
questions

03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:53:49.020 --> 03:53:51.769 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.640 --> 03:54:04.250 align:start position:0%
 
te

03:54:04.250 --> 03:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.530 --> 03:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:54:08.210 --> 03:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I am Dennis
 
03:54:10.010 --> 03:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
Goulet I'm the commissioner for the
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
Department of information technology
 
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
which is responsible for it for the
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government in New
 
03:54:16.920 --> 03:54:18.349 align:start position:0%
executive branch of government in New
Hampshire

03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
um first of all I want to start out with
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
a little scope
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
um because you know there's been some
 
03:54:23.570 --> 03:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note and how it was
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
developed and whether it's accurate or
 
03:54:28.370 --> 03:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
not so I want to touch on that a little
 
03:54:28.380 --> 03:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
not so I want to touch on that a little
bit

03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:30.189 align:start position:0%
bit
um

03:54:30.189 --> 03:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm you know one of the
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
implications was the um that the um
 
03:54:37.610 --> 03:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion relative to the
 
03:54:41.090 --> 03:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
websites and and applications that are
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
public facing so I want to touch on that
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
just for a minute it turns out that I
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
didn't consider our websites in scope
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
for either this bill or House Bill 327
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
which is a JavaScript bill because we're
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
running we're presently running 96
 
03:54:55.680 --> 03:54:56.469 align:start position:0%
running we're presently running 96
um

03:54:56.469 --> 03:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
executive branch websites and
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
most of those have already been moved
 
03:55:04.010 --> 03:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
over to our new platform which is
 
03:55:05.809 --> 03:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
actually running an open source and and
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have the JavaScript problem nor
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
nor do we consider it yeah we consider
 
03:55:13.130 --> 03:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
it compliant with the language of this
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
bill so there's no website work that we
 
03:55:17.929 --> 03:55:17.939 align:start position:0%
considered having to be funded or done
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
because we're already doing that work on
 
03:55:22.370 --> 03:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
an existing project that's moving all
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
the executive branch websites into the
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
Drupal platform managed by Aqua on our
 
03:55:33.050 --> 03:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
behalf so I consider that something that
 
03:55:34.729 --> 03:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
I didn't include in the scope of either
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
of those bills and what we did include
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
though is we looked at how many
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
applications we had in the executive
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
branch of government which was
 
03:55:45.010 --> 03:55:45.020 align:start position:0%
um actually I'm looking it up now we had
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
670 executive branch applications that
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
we looked at these are these are not
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
little things that we we kind of made
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
sure it was bigger than a bread box
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
before we considered it and up to 271 of
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
those are public facing and then we said
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know you you have to make
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
assumptions on a fiscal note like this
 
03:56:06.050 --> 03:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
so we we made an assumption that we
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
would have to address 90 percent of
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
those so so that's you know and then we
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
looked at broke up the applications into
 
03:56:18.769 --> 03:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
small medium large and extra large and
 
03:56:20.929 --> 03:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
uh you may recall that it was a range of
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
costs in House Bill 327 we put a single
 
03:56:26.090 --> 03:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
cost per application size in this bill
 
03:56:28.010 --> 03:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
because we actually have a lot of recent
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
experience acquiring applications so we
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
had a decent idea of how much it would
 
03:56:35.090 --> 03:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
cost to implement an app for example the
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue uh their new
 
03:56:40.150 --> 03:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue information system which is
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
specifically called out in this language
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
cost a little over 30 million dollars to
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
implement over a three year period so so
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
we had some reasonable good numbers
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
so I would submit that neither did I
 
03:56:57.950 --> 03:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstand nor is the the fiscal note
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
um far off
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to address the the
 
03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
concept of doing it all now versus doing
 
03:57:07.250 --> 03:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
it incrementally going forward uh which
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know certainly would be the right
 
03:57:10.370 --> 03:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
way to do any large change like that
 
03:57:12.769 --> 03:57:12.779 align:start position:0%
we're considering here
 
03:57:14.990 --> 03:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
um one of the factors is and we talked
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
about this before was there's you know
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
state government applications are very
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
specific there isn't a huge Market out
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
there for the a lot of these 271 apps
 
03:57:28.370 --> 03:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
are very unique to that particular thing
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
that we're doing so when we go out and
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
acquire there A lot of times there are
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
Niche companies who are developing this
 
03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
like the revenue system for example it's
 
03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
a niche company they do revenue and they
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
do driver license that's all they do
 
03:57:40.610 --> 03:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's no open source alternative for
 
03:57:43.849 --> 03:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
that so what we would my assumptions
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
under the fiscal note and those would
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
apply whether we did it you know set up
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
over A Five-Year Plan to turn everything
 
03:57:53.710 --> 03:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
over but we just did everything upon
 
03:57:56.809 --> 03:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
reacquiring or re-bidding is that we
 
03:57:58.729 --> 03:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
would have to develop in an open source
 
03:57:58.739 --> 03:58:00.229 align:start position:0%
would have to develop in an open source
context

03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
context
 
03:58:03.229 --> 03:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
most of the apps we were acquiring if we
 
03:58:05.210 --> 03:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
did require that we use open source for
 
03:58:07.450 --> 03:58:07.460 align:start position:0%
that so we'd create an open source info
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
ecosystem we would have to hire
 
03:58:11.570 --> 03:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
developers or contract with developers
 
03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
to do that and we'd operate in that
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
manner so that those were the
 
03:58:18.110 --> 03:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
assumptions in my bill and you know I
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
would stand by the the cost whether it
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
was compressed into a five-year period
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
or done over a 30-year period very
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
expensive uh to to do this
 
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to address you know we
 
03:58:33.889 --> 03:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
actually do consider open source
 
03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
every time we're looking at something in
 
03:58:38.689 --> 03:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
fact I just gave an example of our
 
03:58:40.010 --> 03:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
websites when we went out and said all
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
right we need a platform to develop and
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
host our web stuff we picked Drupal
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
because it was a really great
 
03:58:48.290 --> 03:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
alternative there were companies out
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
there that would help us manage it so I
 
03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
could you know that was 96 websites I
 
03:58:55.490 --> 03:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
support them with three people
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
three people in my staff so it's a
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
pretty efficient setup with that so
 
03:59:02.210 --> 03:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's working well we have over a
 
03:59:04.729 --> 03:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
thousand Linux servers running
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
um almost all of our major State
 
03:59:09.530 --> 03:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
applications including the uh including
 
03:59:11.689 --> 03:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
the integrated eligibility system that
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
HHS operates called New Heights that has
 
03:59:15.769 --> 03:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
a citizen-facing component which is
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire easy
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
um you know so we're our learning
 
03:59:23.750 --> 03:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
management system is open source so when
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
there's a good alternative that already
 
03:59:25.439 --> 03:59:26.809 align:start position:0%
there's a good alternative that already
exists

03:59:26.809 --> 03:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
exists
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
you know I'm all for it what the reason
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the language of the bill
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and focusing simply on open sources
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not practical we would
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
have to the time to value for new
 
03:59:43.330 --> 03:59:43.340 align:start position:0%
applications if we have to develop them
 
03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
versus you know purchase an 85 or 90
 
03:59:50.090 --> 03:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
solution off the shelf is you know is
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
too far out it actually would constrain
 
03:59:54.370 --> 03:59:54.380 align:start position:0%
our ability to improve citizen service
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
and again we'd have to be contracting
 
03:59:59.150 --> 03:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
with more developers than we do today
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative Prada thank you I'm sorry
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't have the fiscal note so can you
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
tell me the cost on the fiscal note uh
 
04:00:17.330 --> 04:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.340 --> 04:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
right now I think it was
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
um I had um put it at it's about a
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
little over 320 million for each year 24
 
04:00:38.330 --> 04:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
25 and 26. that's assuming we would
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
churn over those 271 applications in
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
five years so I actually if you look at
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
my original the worksheet that I did for
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
myself it's a Five-Year Plan very tight
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
Five-Year Plan that would be you know
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
that about a little over 320 320 million
 
04:00:57.290 --> 04:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
per year
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blackis yeah
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
just uh so I understand the assumptions
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
you made concerning the interpretation
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
of this when you do the physical note
 
04:01:08.210 --> 04:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
were you assuming that this would
 
04:01:08.220 --> 04:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
were you assuming that this would
require

04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
that any public-facing application would
 
04:01:15.889 --> 04:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
have to have zero proprietary software
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I assume 90 of those public facing
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
applications not websites would have no
 
04:01:27.050 --> 04:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
no propriety in other words you know I I
 
04:01:29.570 --> 04:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
considered we'd have to create an open
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
source entity inside the state and
 
04:01:36.410 --> 04:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
operate that and you know because there
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't such a thing existing today
 
04:01:42.290 --> 04:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
and then our and our anybody we
 
04:01:44.450 --> 04:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
contracted with or our own developers
 
04:01:46.689 --> 04:01:46.699 align:start position:0%
would have to operate in that context
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up just to clarify we
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
said 90 I mean you'd you'd have to get
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
it down to the point where no more than
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
10 percent was proprietary or you're
 
04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
saying there's some percentage now or
 
04:01:58.729 --> 04:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
well I I was interpreting you know this
 
04:02:00.410 --> 04:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
is an assumption I made which I could be
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect but I said the the language of
 
04:02:05.450 --> 04:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
the bill said um you know all but a very
 
04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:06.769 align:start position:0%
the bill said um you know all but a very
few

04:02:06.769 --> 04:02:06.779 align:start position:0%
few
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
so I just said all right 90 you know we
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
could say 95 we could say 85 you know
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm you know all right thank you yeah
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
would this be considered a very
 
04:02:22.610 --> 04:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
labor-intensive activity more so than
 
04:02:24.530 --> 04:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
physical infrastructure or what would be
 
04:02:27.290 --> 04:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
the main cost here well um well the um
 
04:02:29.929 --> 04:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
the biggest cost I think would be
 
04:02:32.090 --> 04:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
there's two you know two two costs free
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
software isn't free um in fact when I
 
04:02:38.090 --> 04:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
pay for software the largest cost isn't
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
the actually the acquisition of the
 
04:02:41.150 --> 04:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
software it's the implementation of the
 
04:02:42.410 --> 04:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
software and that would be true for open
 
04:02:44.689 --> 04:02:44.699 align:start position:0%
source as well so if if you say I want
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
to change from system a to system B
 
04:02:49.370 --> 04:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
even even if I'm not paying for the
 
04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
software for system B there's a large
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
cost of turning over both opportunity
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
costs inside the organization I.E taking
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
work away from doing your day job and
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
moving that system as well as you know
 
04:03:02.929 --> 04:03:02.939 align:start position:0%
any Services you might need wrap around
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
follow please thank you madam chair
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
my my question is more concerning there
 
04:03:14.090 --> 04:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
seems to be an activist Community that's
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
very concerned about this would there be
 
04:03:18.050 --> 04:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
any way for these activists to be active
 
04:03:20.210 --> 04:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
and actually implementing this and then
 
04:03:22.729 --> 04:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
cutting the state's cost in it or is
 
04:03:24.769 --> 04:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
this sensitive data that's whatever well
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
it it absolutely is in fact a lot of my
 
04:03:29.570 --> 04:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
roles require
 
04:03:31.969 --> 04:03:31.979 align:start position:0%
um you know in fact when I if I bring on
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
new employees uh depending on where
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're working there's certain you know
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hoops we have to jump through before I
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
can even hire them because of the type
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
of data that's being used most
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
particularly in revenue and Department
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
of Safety
 
04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon baber thank you madam
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
chair I have a question for you are we
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
continuing this later is it does it go
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
to Executive does it go to
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee obviously there's so many
 
04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
more questions thank you
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I don't think we should
 
04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
consider this a graduate course and and
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
software but um we'll I don't think
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be exacting it right away
 
04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Goulet I have a question as I am
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
not a software engineer so first but as
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
I read the bill it simply says that if
 
04:04:24.889 --> 04:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'm on my computer using
 
04:04:28.010 --> 04:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
Linux and open office or whatever
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
can I access these systems and I have to
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
say that I have been able to for example
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
file my interest in dividends tax
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
without using proprietary software and
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that their system is
 
04:04:44.330 --> 04:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
so what is
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
isn't it only the interface that this
 
04:04:50.090 --> 04:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
bill affects well or am I confused well
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
I think as written it's more expansive
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly we do it's
 
04:04:59.090 --> 04:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
certainly not our intent to require
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
people to use open source software
 
04:05:04.370 --> 04:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think that uh it there may
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
be applications we have particularly
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
older ones because we have applications
 
04:05:10.189 --> 04:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
everything from brand new right now to
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
35 years old and and what we're seeing
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
is the ones the older ones tend to be
 
04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
more restrictive because technology
 
04:05:18.889 --> 04:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
wasn't as good 35 years ago as it is
 
04:05:25.929 --> 04:05:25.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.910 --> 04:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about having a
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
open source environment I mean would you
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
able to check it out by using an open
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
source web browser and say can I can I
 
04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
do what I need to do on this software
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
regardless of what's inside the Black
 
04:05:44.530 --> 04:05:44.540 align:start position:0%
Box yeah
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
and that would be an event I think that
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
would be a piece but that particular
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
valuation would be a bit by bit on the
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
271 apps as we re-procure them if we
 
04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
chose to go forward that way okay thank
 
04:05:57.600 --> 04:05:58.490 align:start position:0%
chose to go forward that way okay thank
you

04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes represent gold
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello hi uh and
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to ensure that the 300
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
million is that what the figure was you
 
04:06:15.600 --> 04:06:16.330 align:start position:0%
million is that what the figure was you
gave

04:06:16.330 --> 04:06:16.340 align:start position:0%
gave
 
04:06:19.610 --> 04:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
320 and those formulatically done and
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take anybody that
 
04:06:24.530 --> 04:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
desires to go through my my my model
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
through it in detail yeah no I trust you
 
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of the scope you were talking
 
04:06:32.210 --> 04:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
about so as I and thank you madam chair
 
04:06:33.769 --> 04:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
for your question that was my question
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
as I understand it what we're talking
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
about is going forward ensuring that any
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
new programs that are developed will
 
04:06:44.889 --> 04:06:44.899 align:start position:0%
accept open source created documents
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
formats would that reduce the 300
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar costs to put that clause
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
in your bids for software development in
 
04:06:55.969 --> 04:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
the future that's a that's a completely
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
different animal in my in my estimation
 
04:07:01.010 --> 04:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
um it would cause a reevaluation and
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at what the specific
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.530 --> 04:07:14.540 align:start position:0%
we're always looking for a
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
85 or 90 solution to get to that hundred
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
is a lot more expensive than the 85 or
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
90. and um when we're talking about
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
um okay we're going to have systems that
 
04:07:28.729 --> 04:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
will accept any kind of document format
 
04:07:30.050 --> 04:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
that that adds quite a bit of complexity
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
potentially in some cases and I think
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at that at every
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
single system for example if I go out
 
04:07:40.130 --> 04:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
and procure
 
04:07:42.410 --> 04:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
um a system to do case management for
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
example for an HHS use case
 
04:07:49.969 --> 04:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
um we certainly are looking to be able
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
to accept any document formats that are
 
04:07:54.769 --> 04:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
generally being used out there would
 
04:07:56.809 --> 04:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
that exclude some particular document
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
format it may so again just you know a
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
lot of application developers look at
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
all right what is for example web
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
browser I heard the web browser example
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
which is a really good one generally
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
what we look at is all right what's the
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
market share out there for any for for
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
and take the highest you know take the
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
high end of the market share what are
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
people actually using and addressing you
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:08:24.769 --> 04:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
that'll typically get most people happy
 
04:08:24.779 --> 04:08:29.150 align:start position:0%
that'll typically get most people happy
okay

04:08:29.150 --> 04:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much commissioner thank
 
04:08:34.010 --> 04:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
you I think we will not vote on this at
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
the moment we're too confused
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll close does anyone else wish to
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 617
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the hearing and
 
04:08:50.689 --> 04:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill 284 and I
 
04:08:53.090 --> 04:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
presume representative Aaron wants to
 
04:08:53.100 --> 04:08:56.330 align:start position:0%
presume representative Aaron wants to
speak

04:08:56.330 --> 04:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.340 --> 04:09:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for uh having me come
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
and introduce this bill
 
04:09:41.689 --> 04:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
I'm here today I'm representative Judy
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
Aaron representing
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County District 4 the towns of
 
04:09:49.490 --> 04:09:49.500 align:start position:0%

Washington
 
04:09:55.490 --> 04:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to introduce HB 284
 
04:09:58.370 --> 04:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
this bill modifies and clarifies what is
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
prohibited from being made available to
 
04:10:02.809 --> 04:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
the public regarding information
 
04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
relative to rfbs
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
request for bids rfps requests for
 
04:10:11.050 --> 04:10:11.060 align:start position:0%
proposals or rfas
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
cancellations requests for applications
 
04:10:16.370 --> 04:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
constituents of mine
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
have been having difficulty getting
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
basic information about these
 
04:10:19.920 --> 04:10:22.130 align:start position:0%
basic information about these
cancellations

04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
cancellations
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
and agencies are not answering any
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
questions about RFB RFP and rfas in
 
04:10:29.279 --> 04:10:30.650 align:start position:0%
questions about RFB RFP and rfas in
general

04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:10:30.660 --> 04:10:31.370 align:start position:0%
general
um

04:10:31.370 --> 04:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me this bill seeks to clarify
 
04:10:38.630 --> 04:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
that basic questions can be answered
 
04:10:41.450 --> 04:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
I had this happen to me as well
 
04:10:43.610 --> 04:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
when I was seeking information about an
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
RFP regarding Broadband expansion
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the agency handling the RFP would not
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
give me any information about the
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
bidding process
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
or status or when a decision was going
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
to be made regarding a Broadband
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
granting process
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
my bill inserts new language to the RSA
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
stating that it is okay to provide
 
04:11:08.450 --> 04:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
information about an RFP RFB or RFA
 
04:11:08.460 --> 04:11:11.809 align:start position:0%
information about an RFP RFB or RFA
determination

04:11:11.809 --> 04:11:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
um cancellation or non-selection as long
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
as it isn't information related to other
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
bids or other bidders
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
for far too long agencies have avoided
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
giving out any information to bidders
 
04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
about or in or the public about any
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
cancellation process or status of a bid
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
by hiding behind parts of this statute
 
04:11:34.809 --> 04:11:34.819 align:start position:0%
which is RSA
 
04:11:38.349 --> 04:11:38.359 align:start position:0%
21-g colon 37.
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
clarification is therefore needed
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
because State agencies most likely
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
misinterpret this RSA or merely use it
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
as a reason not to answer questions at
 
04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:49.550 align:start position:0%
as a reason not to answer questions at
all

04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
examples of questions that have been
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
denied based on this RSA include
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
questions about when in an award might
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
be made the reasons why a solicitation
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
was canceled
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
if a new solicitation might be reissued
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
later on Etc
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
so when a bidder asks for simple and
 
04:12:09.889 --> 04:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
basic information they are met with the
 
04:12:13.130 --> 04:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
phrase quote state law restricts us from
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
commenting on any canceled solicitations
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
and they are quoted the link to the RSA
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
21-g colon 37 so for instance
 
04:12:24.410 --> 04:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
the following questions can never get a
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
response what's the timeline or status
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
of this RFP why was this RFP canceled
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
what happens to the funding for this RFP
 
04:12:36.769 --> 04:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
now that this RFP is canceled what are
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
the future plans for this RFP and will
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
they plan to reopen it again at another
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
time do we have to resubmit the
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
application if the RFP is reinstated
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
will my application be automatically
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
resubmitted if this RFP is reinstated
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
so none of those kinds of questions are
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
being answered they're all saying
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
we can't give you any information
 
04:13:01.849 --> 04:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
so these questions have nothing to do
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
with other bids or other bidders and
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
they don't give anyone an unfair
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
advantage in the bidding process to the
 
04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
questioner so why is this information
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
being prohibited from being provided by
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
the agency to the bidder asking the
 
04:13:14.580 --> 04:13:16.250 align:start position:0%
the agency to the bidder asking the
questions

04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
my new language changes this and allows
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
for basic information about the process
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
plans and status of an RFP RFB or RFA
 
04:13:28.250 --> 04:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
so that the bidder can at least get an
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
idea of where the process is and what
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
the agency is planning for this RFP RFB
 
04:13:35.210 --> 04:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
or RFA
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
this assists the bidder to plan
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
accordingly or at least know what is
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:13:43.370 --> 04:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
I also added a section to the statute
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
that inserts the following new paragraph
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
quote nothing in this chapter shall be
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
construed as a justification to avoid
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
answering questions posed by the public
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
or members of the general court that are
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
unrelated to information regarding other
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
bids or bidders to an RFB RFP RFA or
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
similar submission
 
04:14:03.530 --> 04:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
and this further clarifies that an
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
agency cannot use this statute as
 
04:14:07.729 --> 04:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
justification to not answer questions
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
unrelated to other bids or bidders
 
04:14:12.650 --> 04:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
I believe that in the interest of Common
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
Sense and government transparency that
 
04:14:17.570 --> 04:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
these changes need to be made to this
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
RSA and I hope that you will agree and
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
support this change to this statute
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.769 --> 04:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair as far as
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
chapter I mean um section eight nothing
 
04:14:37.490 --> 04:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the chapter Shelby can show his
 
04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
justification the last part
 
04:14:41.450 --> 04:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
what is the penalty if they do not
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
disclose is this under the Privacy Act
 
04:14:43.500 --> 04:14:44.929 align:start position:0%
disclose is this under the Privacy Act
or

04:14:44.929 --> 04:14:44.939 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:14:48.050 --> 04:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's any penalty that
 
04:14:50.570 --> 04:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of so you're asking them to
 
04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
release information they haven't been
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
releasing so far
 
04:14:57.530 --> 04:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
um well they they
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
should be releasing this information
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't
 
04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything to do with
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
giving anybody an unfair advantage
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
follow up I agree with you what I'm just
 
04:15:09.170 --> 04:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
getting at is generally government
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do something unless they're
 
04:15:13.130 --> 04:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
forced to do it so I mean asking seems
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
like it's not going to get anywhere
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
since we've been doing you've been doing
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that so far and haven't gotten anywhere
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm concerned about thank
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
it'll happen representative O'Brien
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Clerk and thank you
 
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:15:28.849 --> 04:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
for my clarity
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between your bill
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
04:15:37.500 --> 04:15:38.210 align:start position:0%
not sure
um

04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know if uh right to
 
04:15:45.650 --> 04:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
know comes into play with any of this it
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
probably should but uh clearly what
 
04:15:50.570 --> 04:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
these agencies are doing are not
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
answering basic questions and saying
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
that statute prohibits them from
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
answering those questions so we're
 
04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
trying to clear up the statute so that
 
04:16:03.010 --> 04:16:03.020 align:start position:0%
they can see that they're they're not
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
violating anything by giving basic
 
04:16:09.530 --> 04:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
information the uh
 
04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute you gave us it
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding the provisions of
 
04:16:18.530 --> 04:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a so they're they're saying the
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
the bidding process is not
 
04:16:21.779 --> 04:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
the bidding process is not
open

04:16:22.870 --> 04:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
291a essentially that it's protected
 
04:16:30.769 --> 04:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
okay I understand so evidently and her
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill says well you could still tell
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
these pieces of it to people I would
 
04:16:38.570 --> 04:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
imagine the people who wrote RSA 91a had
 
04:16:41.330 --> 04:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
this intention in mind when they
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
when they scribed it but that's
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and I have
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
copies of my testimony so I'll pass them
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.800 --> 04:17:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:17:54.650 --> 04:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.170 --> 04:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and Ladies and
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen of the committee for the
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
record my name is Derek Ferlin I'm the
 
04:18:02.570 --> 04:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
County Manager for Sullivan County
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of House
 
04:18:08.330 --> 04:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 284 and the amendment uh but my
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
testimony today is confined to the
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
original scope of House Bill 284 as it
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
was drafted
 
04:18:14.040 --> 04:18:16.070 align:start position:0%
was drafted
uh

04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
at the risk of reiterating much of what
 
04:18:19.849 --> 04:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor representative Aaron
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
said I just wanted to share a little bit
 
04:18:23.469 --> 04:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
of additional background
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
which led to the crafting of the of the
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
bill it's an experience that I had in
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually working with executive
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
departments on various matters uh the
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
RGA and the request for Grant
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
application process which is covered in
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
part by RSA 21g37
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll get to the specifics of of uh
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
of what I experienced shortly
 
04:18:47.399 --> 04:18:49.130 align:start position:0%
of what I experienced shortly
um

04:18:49.130 --> 04:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
as representative Aaron mentioned this
 
04:18:52.429 --> 04:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
bill makes very small but I think there
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
are critical uh tweaks to this bill
 
04:18:54.960 --> 04:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
are critical uh tweaks to this bill
language

04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:18:59.689 --> 04:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
um or to the RSA I think if I were to
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
infer legislative intent I could say
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience that the way
 
04:19:07.010 --> 04:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 21g37 is being used is it's
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually being misunderstood and
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
therefore misused by some members of of
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
the executive departments
 
04:19:16.370 --> 04:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
um just simply if and I included in in
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
the handout
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
as well as uh my cover letter with an
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
attachment I've actually got the build
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
text I wasn't sure if you all had that
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
readily available so I highlighted two
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
sections that I think really speak to
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
the confusion that's caused by the lack
 
04:19:33.170 --> 04:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
of this uh added bit of clarity
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
um first of all start with this the
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
title uh financial information regarding
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
requests for bids and proposals so I
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
think that does set the tone for what
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was behind this
 
04:19:45.290 --> 04:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
law uh it's it's I think regarding
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
specific financial information
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
um and right in paragraph one uh the
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
highlighted part begins with concerning
 
04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
specific responses to requests for bids
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals and requests for
 
04:19:57.479 --> 04:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals and requests for
applications

04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
applications
 
04:20:01.450 --> 04:20:01.460 align:start position:0%
if you look at page two
 
04:20:04.370 --> 04:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph six talks about when an agency
 
04:20:07.729 --> 04:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
cancels one of these solicitations and
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
then it simply says no information other
 
04:20:11.150 --> 04:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
than the notification of the
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
cancellation shall be available to the
 
04:20:13.380 --> 04:20:14.389 align:start position:0%
cancellation shall be available to the
public

04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:20:16.490 --> 04:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
etc etc so that's where I think that's
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
where the disconnect is because in
 
04:20:20.210 --> 04:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
section one and following on with the
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
title of the of the RSA it's very clear
 
04:20:25.370 --> 04:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
that this should be confined to specific
 
04:20:27.110 --> 04:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
responses which makes perfect sense if
 
04:20:28.610 --> 04:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
you're a contractor and you've submitted
 
04:20:31.969 --> 04:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
a Paving project at dot you shouldn't go
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
in and be able to see what company a b
 
04:20:36.170 --> 04:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
or c did for their bid that would be an
 
04:20:38.929 --> 04:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
unfair uh competitive disadvantage for
 
04:20:41.689 --> 04:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
for those bidders but as representative
 
04:20:44.570 --> 04:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
Aaron said when the questions are Hey
 
04:20:46.490 --> 04:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
when's the scoring going to uh happen
 
04:20:49.610 --> 04:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
those are purely procedural process
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
related questions that have absolutely
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any particular
 
04:20:55.610 --> 04:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
submittal and yet the response typically
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
is sorry under RSA 21g37 can't tell you
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything and I can just tell you when
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're working on a Grant application
 
04:21:05.570 --> 04:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's generally tied in the case of
 
04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County our funding Stacks tend
 
04:21:08.689 --> 04:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
to be pretty complex
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any money so we
 
04:21:12.530 --> 04:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
have to seek multiple sources and so the
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
timeline of when those sources actually
 
04:21:16.490 --> 04:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
you get approved or not they really
 
04:21:16.500 --> 04:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
you get approved or not they really
matter

04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:21:20.210 --> 04:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
so when you're trying to put together a
 
04:21:22.150 --> 04:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
project that's reliant on various
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
sources of grant funding you know those
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
are that's a basic premise that's very
 
04:21:29.689 --> 04:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
very important
 
04:21:29.699 --> 04:21:30.830 align:start position:0%
very important
um

04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
so if you refer to the second page of of
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
my submittal this is just a quick
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
summary of uh of the timeline of I think
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
the most recent time that I ran into
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
this it was a couple years ago
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
um shortly after Cove had started so you
 
04:21:45.769 --> 04:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
can just see in
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
um entry number one in April the RGA was
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
was due the submittals were due and so a
 
04:21:53.570 --> 04:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
little over a month later I just emailed
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
and said hey I was just looking for an
 
04:21:54.960 --> 04:21:56.389 align:start position:0%
and said hey I was just looking for an
update

04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
update
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
um about a week later I got the response
 
04:22:00.010 --> 04:22:00.020 align:start position:0%
cannot provide any for any information
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh during a procurement in accordance
 
04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
with RSA 21g37
 
04:22:08.150 --> 04:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and then if you skip down to uh entry
 
04:22:10.370 --> 04:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
number eight this was in January 8th of
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
2021 so almost a year later
 
04:22:15.769 --> 04:22:15.779 align:start position:0%
um I found out that the the RGA was
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
canceled and so those are the actual
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
questions uh that I asked why was it
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
canceled what will happen with the
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
funding will there be another RFP or RGA
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
issued later in the year and if the
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
answer is yes will those Auto
 
04:22:31.370 --> 04:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
applications roll over automatically so
 
04:22:33.130 --> 04:22:33.140 align:start position:0%
again nothing to do with any other
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
solicitation or submittal and certainly
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
nothing that would delve into the
 
04:22:39.410 --> 04:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
financial particulars of any of those
 
04:22:41.929 --> 04:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
submittals and so the last entry number
 
04:22:44.210 --> 04:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
nine is is again verbatim the response
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
that I got and just just to note some of
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
the blanks
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I took the liberty of just sanitizing
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
this because I'm not my intent here is
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
not to throw a particular Department
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
under the bus and embarrass anybody I
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
just think it's a systemic problem that
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
really gets back to the lack of clarity
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
of section six and so I don't cast any
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
aspersions on a particular staff member
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
I just think it's just a little bit of
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
um the lack of clarity leads to the
 
04:23:06.779 --> 04:23:13.309 align:start position:0%
um the lack of clarity leads to the
misunderstanding

04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I think uh that concludes my my
 
04:23:20.349 --> 04:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
testimony I just wanted to give a bit of
 
04:23:23.929 --> 04:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
additional information to show how this
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
RSA is implemented in in practice using
 
04:23:28.610 --> 04:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
a real world example
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and I think this this minor tweak
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
will will go a long ways towards helping
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
provide better guidance maybe for the
 
04:23:36.050 --> 04:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
executive department so that they can be
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
more responsive and provide information
 
04:23:40.490 --> 04:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
when it's completely unrelated to any
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
other specific uh bids or the financial
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
information contained therein
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%

04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:23:51.410 --> 04:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick uh thank you
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I think I understand it
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
now so I'm just going to give you a
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
scenario and see if if this is exactly
 
04:24:00.769 --> 04:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
where you're going with this
 
04:24:04.010 --> 04:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
you want to pave 10 miles worth of worth
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
of Roads you put it out to a bid the the
 
04:24:10.010 --> 04:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
bids come in and you can't do 10 miles
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
the the prices are up you can only do
 
04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
eight let's let's say you have to go
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
back to your new back to your governing
 
04:24:18.530 --> 04:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
body and go through you know what are
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
you going to cut yada yada yada and
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
someone call but so you cancel the the
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
uh bids and you're gonna have to start
 
04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
over again at a future time a citizen
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
calls you and says why are why were the
 
04:24:34.969 --> 04:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
bids canceled you can't tell them that
 
04:24:37.010 --> 04:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying you can't
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
tell them that scenario that I just
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
that I just said they we couldn't afford
 
04:24:46.670 --> 04:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
it we had a is that what you're saying
 
04:24:50.150 --> 04:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
I would say I think in part yes I think
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
if if the answer was
 
04:24:52.560 --> 04:24:53.330 align:start position:0%
if if the answer was
um

04:24:53.330 --> 04:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
the bids all exceeded available funding
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's not getting into the specific
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
Financial particulars of a specific
 
04:24:59.640 --> 04:25:01.309 align:start position:0%
Financial particulars of a specific
response

04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
response
 
04:25:03.110 --> 04:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh which again which is in section one
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
clearly states that you can't give out
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
specific bid responses right but if you
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
were just going to Simply respond to
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
that Citizen and say well we canceled it
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have enough money I
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be right now what you'd
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
get is I can't tell you anything right
 
04:25:17.570 --> 04:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
so you couldn't tell them that yes
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm pardon me for following
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
up without per uh so okay uh thank you
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%

04:25:40.979 --> 04:25:55.809 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:25:55.809 --> 04:25:55.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee I
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%

04:26:11.520 --> 04:26:14.090 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 284 not the
amendment

04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.269 --> 04:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
okay in that case I will call
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
Representative shuitt to present
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
onest thank you madam chair uh for the
 
04:26:35.769 --> 04:26:35.779 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane schuett
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of Pembroke
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
Merrimack 12 and I'm also a chair of the
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County delegation
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
um this amendment number
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
0320h I believe you all have coffees
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a non-germaine amendment that does
 
04:26:59.090 --> 04:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
not change any language in the original
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
House fill 284 but simply would add to
 
04:27:03.840 --> 04:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
House fill 284 but simply would add to
it

04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
this language originally went to another
 
04:27:11.410 --> 04:27:11.420 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house as House Bill 148
 
04:27:15.490 --> 04:27:15.500 align:start position:0%
which voted it in expedient to legislate
 
04:27:18.889 --> 04:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
based not on the content but rather
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
simply because the sponsor was unable to
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
present introduce it and speak to it
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
we were able to get that bill laid on
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the table when it came before the house
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
so that the language could be brought
 
04:27:36.649 --> 04:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
forward again
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is the amendment you see before you
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
it basically enables all 10 counties to
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
avoid requesting bids on items or
 
04:27:51.170 --> 04:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
Services under ten thousand dollars
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
there are several others here who can
 
04:27:57.410 --> 04:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
explain the reasoning behind it the time
 
04:28:00.110 --> 04:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
and costs this would save our counties
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
and our taxpayers and probably answer
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have on the
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you are there any questions
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:28:17.100 --> 04:28:18.349 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
schuett

04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
schuett
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
so am I correct in understanding that
 
04:28:23.570 --> 04:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
this replacement I'm not seeing anything
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
in here that changes the nature of the
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
information that would get released that
 
04:28:31.370 --> 04:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
was in the original Bill we talked about
 
04:28:33.889 --> 04:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
this this amendment would not change
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
anything in 284. okay it just adds the
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
contents of houseville 148 to it okay to
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:45.239 --> 04:28:46.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:28:50.030 --> 04:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's an add-on not a replace all right a
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
friendly amendment I would say right
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gerhart thank you
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
I think we spoke about this earlier at
 
04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
the county delegation but I'm just
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about the transparency aspect
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
of this so if we're going from five to
 
04:29:05.570 --> 04:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
ten thousand is there any way to make
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
all of these purchase purchases that are
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
in that zone that's changed the five to
 
04:29:11.929 --> 04:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar range more publicly
 
04:29:13.729 --> 04:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
accessible instead of having to go
 
04:29:15.530 --> 04:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
through the 91a route or I'm just
 
04:29:18.410 --> 04:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
curious that was ever entered your
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
um I would say to ask that question of
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
the folks who are the prime sponsor of
 
04:29:25.370 --> 04:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
148 is here and I would say he'd be
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer that thank you
 
04:29:27.840 --> 04:29:29.210 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer that thank you
okay

04:29:29.210 --> 04:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
anyone else okay thank you
 
04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%

yeah hi uh for the record I'm
 
04:29:45.530 --> 04:29:45.540 align:start position:0%

Rockingham District 31 Auburn Chester
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
sand down excuse me Candia and uh
 
04:29:54.370 --> 04:29:54.380 align:start position:0%
Deerfield redistricting I still haven't
 
04:29:57.889 --> 04:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
rewound my tape yet I uh all four towns
 
04:30:00.889 --> 04:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
are in Rockingham County I'm the prime
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 148.
 
04:30:04.800 --> 04:30:06.469 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 148.
um I

04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
I I screwed up I failed to show up at
 
04:30:12.649 --> 04:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
the introduction briefing or hearing for
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
148 so it was a good bill then it's a
 
04:30:17.450 --> 04:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
good bill now it has a tremendous amount
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
of support because I didn't show up uh
 
04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
the the chair's position was to
 
04:30:26.210 --> 04:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
recommend itl and it's too good of a
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill to let that happen to it so
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
um one thing that representative schuett
 
04:30:34.250 --> 04:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
did not mention is just how gracious
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
she's been to step in to an area where I
 
04:30:43.130 --> 04:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
where I'm clearly screwed up and and has
 
04:30:44.929 --> 04:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
stepped up and done the right thing for
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
the counties and I just think that's
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
great teamwork it's a good bill we've
 
04:30:50.939 --> 04:30:51.710 align:start position:0%
great teamwork it's a good bill we've
got

04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner here from Rockingham
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
to talk about it to your issue on
 
04:30:59.929 --> 04:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
transparency representative I I you know
 
04:31:02.269 --> 04:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
our the counties are very transparent in
 
04:31:04.969 --> 04:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
General on the budget and as I think
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
about the county budget I've seen in the
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
lists of Acquisitions I've seen I don't
 
04:31:14.929 --> 04:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know where this new range of of
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
purchases between the the new ones five
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand I don't know where those
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
would show up but but what we're is so
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a fair question and I
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're raising it is
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
because this this has not been raised
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
since 1998 that's when the five thousand
 
04:31:34.490 --> 04:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars went into effect and so if you
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
go look at the inflation scale uh five
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
thousand and 1998 is about nine thousand
 
04:31:44.090 --> 04:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
now so I picked ten thousand dollars
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
because that's what the counties told me
 
04:31:49.010 --> 04:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
they wanted but but it but it actually
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
works out so with that
 
04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
um I take questions if there are any
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
members it's uh it's nice to be back at
 
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
the State House I
 
04:32:13.370 --> 04:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
I was in your seats for a while for 10
 
04:32:15.469 --> 04:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
years from 2010 to 2020 I see some
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
familiar faces and some new faces but uh
 
04:32:20.929 --> 04:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
I appreciate being able to address the
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
committee um as representative Edwards
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
had mentioned the 5000 number was
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
basically in 1998 and if you do the
 
04:32:31.250 --> 04:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
inflationary costs it basically was like
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
it comes out to 92 so we just rounded it
 
04:32:35.929 --> 04:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
to 10. uh and I just want to give you an
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
example of
 
04:32:40.490 --> 04:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
um why this would be beneficial for the
 
04:32:42.110 --> 04:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
county so in my county in Rockingham
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
County we we actually have an outside
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
vendor that does all of the the food
 
04:32:47.040 --> 04:32:48.550 align:start position:0%
vendor that does all of the the food
service

04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:32:51.170 --> 04:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
and they also take care of all of our
 
04:32:53.210 --> 04:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
meals for wheels for Rockingham County
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
which is there's a they produce a lot of
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
meals we had an issue with a piece of
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
kitchen equipment
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
that was over five thousand dollars now
 
04:33:03.410 --> 04:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
we knew where we could get the equipment
 
04:33:05.449 --> 04:33:05.459 align:start position:0%
but according to the law I have to put
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
out the bid so we basically were down
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
with equipment for three three or four
 
04:33:11.810 --> 04:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
days so that kind of put a little bit of
 
04:33:11.820 --> 04:33:12.709 align:start position:0%
days so that kind of put a little bit of
a

04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
a crinkle on that that's how this came
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
to be and we looked at it and we said
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
well 5000 really doesn't get it's really
 
04:33:21.051 --> 04:33:21.061 align:start position:0%
not much now so
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
um we're asking I mean it's as simple as
 
04:33:25.730 --> 04:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
that we're asking to to go to 10
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing else
 
04:33:29.689 --> 04:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
um really to be said but but just that
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
so it just gives us a little bit more
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
wiggle room
 
04:33:34.369 --> 04:33:34.379 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:33:36.890 --> 04:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative has a
 
04:33:39.529 --> 04:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
question and it sounds specific well
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
specific to Rockingham so in the
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative schuett
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
submitted there's a specific clause in
 
04:33:52.609 --> 04:33:52.619 align:start position:0%
RSA it's 28-e that refers to Hillsboro
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a specific Clause that
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
report that refers to Rockingham
 
04:34:00.051 --> 04:34:00.061 align:start position:0%
but that's not in this amendment so is
 
04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:03.061 align:start position:0%
that are you thinking that the top of it
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
is going to it's actually 28 colon 8f I
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
don't see that any Amendment it's on
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
I am so sorry no that's okay thank you
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome yes so that I'd
 
04:34:20.631 --> 04:34:20.641 align:start position:0%
like to ask on that absolutely the
 
04:34:23.209 --> 04:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County at one time had a
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
unique bidding process but if we make
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
this change you'll use the same as nine
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
as eight other counties
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
yes um my understanding is as we
 
04:34:36.170 --> 04:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
discussed as counties collectively we we
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
always discuss things together
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and uh it it basically
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
um would help them as well
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
so that's where that came to be um and
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
then of course the Cabo for Hillsborough
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
County because it's specific in the in
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
the language in the
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the law so this would include all all
 
04:34:56.689 --> 04:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
counties all 10 counties
 
04:34:59.330 --> 04:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
except Hillsborough
 
04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
um well you've got Hillsborough on the
 
04:35:05.449 --> 04:35:05.459 align:start position:0%
bottom correct yes yeah and the rest of
 
04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
them are in the uh the rest of them
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
right exactly exactly that's that we
 
04:35:11.929 --> 04:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
have to word it that way because
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough has its own section
 
04:35:16.609 --> 04:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
and they and they wanted they also
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
wanted the the benefit of the 10th I
 
04:35:19.849 --> 04:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
mean obviously Hillsborough County being
 
04:35:20.929 --> 04:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
the largest
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we will hear from Hillsborough
 
04:35:26.929 --> 04:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
County yes I can explain why they need
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
their own special piece of Statute yeah
 
04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you manager okay uh Ross
 
04:35:32.279 --> 04:35:34.070 align:start position:0%
thank you manager okay uh Ross

Cunningham
yes

04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair Ross
 
04:35:49.799 --> 04:35:51.170 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair Ross
Cunningham

04:35:51.170 --> 04:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
Cunningham
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
um I am the
 
04:35:55.010 --> 04:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
County Administrator for Merrimack
 
04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:56.090 align:start position:0%
County Administrator for Merrimack
County

04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
um 34 plus years of government service
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
hence my hair loss so good afternoon to
 
04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to give you a kind of a
 
04:36:05.631 --> 04:36:05.641 align:start position:0%
brief reason why Merrimack County is
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
supportive of this change for many
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
reasons and I can give you a snapshot in
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
2022 just in the bracket of the 5000. we
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
did 37 formal bids in that bracket and
 
04:36:21.410 --> 04:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
on average every one of those bid
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
packets because we have a central
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing process it's about 20 to 30
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
staff hours it takes to process each one
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
of those so you can imagine the tasking
 
04:36:34.609 --> 04:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
it takes to do that work and do it in an
 
04:36:37.970 --> 04:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
open transparent way and I think what I
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
would say to you is if it changes from
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
five to ten thousand dollars the reality
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't change for us of how a process
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
is processed the fact of the matter it's
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
the tasking involved with the inflation
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
in the other arguments that were given
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
to you earlier I can tell you that that
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
it is awful taxing at times I've worked
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
in two counties both Sullivan and
 
04:37:03.051 --> 04:37:03.061 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and they are at times can be
 
04:37:05.929 --> 04:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
problematic in in a situation where you
 
04:37:08.449 --> 04:37:08.459 align:start position:0%
have a down piece of equipment or you're
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
pursuing a service and those things are
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
complicated in this world we're trying
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
to work in today post covet other than
 
04:37:19.250 --> 04:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
that I didn't really have any other
 
04:37:21.769 --> 04:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
testimony uh then to tell you I am in
 
04:37:23.449 --> 04:37:23.459 align:start position:0%
support of it and
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
um if you have any questions of myself
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay so may I confirmed that you said
 
04:37:38.090 --> 04:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
that in one year you had 37 rfps in this
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
price range yes ma'am okay thank you and
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
the average time is 20 to 30 hours that
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.529 --> 04:37:48.539 align:start position:0%
three staff hours okay excuse me 20 to
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
30 hours of Staff time to process each
 
04:37:53.631 --> 04:37:53.641 align:start position:0%
one okay which gets numbered and we
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
score and then they're presented to the
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Commissioners for final
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
authorization that's the rest of the
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
story as they unfold of course all right
 
04:38:14.929 --> 04:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is David Ross
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I am the administrator of
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Nursing Home
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
I do stand here in support of the
 
04:38:27.650 --> 04:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
amended House Bill 284 to increase that
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
threshold from five thousand dollars to
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
we are finding that so many products now
 
04:38:35.330 --> 04:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
are included at that five thousand
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
dollar level
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is rapidly increasing the number of
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
our fees that we're having to do for
 
04:38:42.529 --> 04:38:42.539 align:start position:0%
products that are insignificant to
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
business operations such as styrofoam
 
04:38:45.119 --> 04:38:46.310 align:start position:0%
business operations such as styrofoam
cups

04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
cups
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
04:38:51.529 --> 04:38:51.539 align:start position:0%
um and as Mr Cunningham shared the RFP
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
process is extremely labor intensive for
 
04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
us but it's also time intensive in that
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to prepare the RFP for
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
vendors to be able to review and submit
 
04:39:03.289 --> 04:39:03.299 align:start position:0%
a proposal for us to be able to make the
 
04:39:06.170 --> 04:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
bid award and to
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
um procure the products it delays
 
04:39:11.449 --> 04:39:11.459 align:start position:0%
business operations for now at that five
 
04:39:13.070 --> 04:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar level for so many
 
04:39:15.529 --> 04:39:15.539 align:start position:0%
products that really are insignificant
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
back in 1998 when this level was set
 
04:39:21.289 --> 04:39:21.299 align:start position:0%
um since then the price of household
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
paper goods according to the U.S Bureau
 
04:39:26.090 --> 04:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
of Labor Statistics has increased 125
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
percent and we are definitely seeing
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
that at our end so we just ask that we
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
um that you approve that so that we can
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
focus our energy where it really belongs
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
on business operations and on products
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
that are of substantial significance to
 
04:39:42.770 --> 04:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
business operations it does not increase
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that can be spent it
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any impact on budgets it
 
04:39:50.810 --> 04:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
does not change our responsibility to be
 
04:39:50.820 --> 04:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
does not change our responsibility to be
stewards

04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
stewards
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and our fight or our fiduciary
 
04:39:54.060 --> 04:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
um and our fight or our fiduciary
responsibility

04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County does have a separate
 
04:40:02.330 --> 04:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
statute here that dictates what the
 
04:40:04.250 --> 04:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
requirements are for competitive bidding
 
04:40:07.930 --> 04:40:07.940 align:start position:0%
and what the analysis is for bid award
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
and we are not asking for that to change
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
that does help us very much to ensure a
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
consistent and thorough process and we
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
are all very satisfied with that the
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
other counties are satisfied with their
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
process and we appreciate your
 
04:40:24.170 --> 04:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
consideration of that
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.368 --> 04:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Kate
 
04:40:49.730 --> 04:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
Horgan I represent the New Hampshire
 
04:40:52.010 --> 04:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
Association of counties coming around
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
you will see a letter in support uh from
 
04:40:57.170 --> 04:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
the association as well as Merrimack
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
County's written testimony just so that
 
04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
you know that that is coming around so
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
you should take two and here comes
 
04:41:01.980 --> 04:41:03.288 align:start position:0%
you should take two and here comes
Hillsboro's

04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro's
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so we are in support of this
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh can I just say ditto
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
to what my members have stated they did
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
a great job explaining it
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
um it's it's merely an inflation thing
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
but I think they did a great job
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
explaining though
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:41:22.980 --> 04:41:25.670 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:29.330 --> 04:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:41:32.448 --> 04:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:41:35.090 --> 04:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 284 or its
 
04:41:35.100 --> 04:41:38.330 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 284 or its
Amendment

04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.340 --> 04:41:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%

04:41:41.400 --> 04:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
hearing

04:41:45.060 --> 04:41:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]

and open the public hearing on
 
04:41:55.250 --> 04:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
what's the next time
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.890 --> 04:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair were you recognizing me yes
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't I didn't quite hear I
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
apologize uh thank you madam chair and
 
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent rockinghamton
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is New Market and new fields and I
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
am here to introduce hb359 the effect of
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
which it would be to establish a legal
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
holiday for election day as well as uh
 
04:42:51.250 --> 04:42:51.260 align:start position:0%
primary election days
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
so the main issue that I want to kind of
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
bring up is one of voter turnout uh
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
obviously a self-governing body only
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
works when people actually show up to
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
self-govern on the days that we have
 
04:43:10.208 --> 04:43:10.218 align:start position:0%
these things we call elections
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the fourth highest
 
04:43:15.288 --> 04:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
state in the country and I say State
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
because I'm about to go somewhere else
 
04:43:20.330 --> 04:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
with that and yet our voter turnout is
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
under 60 percent in in a good year
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
for most years the United States in
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
general however
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
while we are fourth in the in the
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
country for a state the United States in
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
general is 31st in the world so as
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
self-governing goes we aren't doing that
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
great a job of making sure that we are
 
04:43:42.770 --> 04:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
all actually making sure that all of our
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
voices are being heard
 
04:43:47.690 --> 04:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
I brought up State specifically because
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
we do have a place in the country
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
that excels at voter turnout and that is
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico on the island of Puerto Rico
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
voter turnout in a mid uh off year is in
 
04:44:04.850 --> 04:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
the 80s percentages and in a
 
04:44:07.128 --> 04:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
presidential year is in the 90s
 
04:44:09.288 --> 04:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of looking at those numbers
 
04:44:11.570 --> 04:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
enviously even though we're fourth
 
04:44:13.730 --> 04:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
amongst States
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
um however when Puerto Ricans moved to
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
the mainland
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
their voter turnout drops even beneath
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
regular voter turnout so why is this
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is strange why why is it that
 
04:44:28.610 --> 04:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
Puerto Ricans have such high amazingly
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
High voter turnout high high in you know
 
04:44:34.970 --> 04:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
even amongst World numbers and yet drops
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
to under 50 percent when they come to
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
the mainland the Puerto Ricans have a
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
holiday for their election day
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
and there's two levels to this so the
 
04:44:47.930 --> 04:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
first and most obvious I'll talk about
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
first and that is
 
04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
um having a holiday obviously gives
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
people the time to vote specifically
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
working people it specifically gives
 
04:45:00.050 --> 04:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
people who otherwise might have to work
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
or might not know when they have to work
 
04:45:04.970 --> 04:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
on Election Day
 
04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and so not be able to even fill out
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot ahead of time because
 
04:45:12.050 --> 04:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
as you know our absentee ballots require
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
an affidavit for one of four reasons
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so if you don't know that you're
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to work ahead of time and
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
then it turns out you do have to work
 
04:45:24.050 --> 04:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
then you don't have the ability to fill
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
out that absentee ballot
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
um but then when you do work and you
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
know just imagine your average American
 
04:45:34.730 --> 04:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
life you have to take the kids to school
 
04:45:38.208 --> 04:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
go to work work all day come back pick
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
the kids up maybe there's a soccer game
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a recital of some sort
 
04:45:44.810 --> 04:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
make dinner this is very difficult for
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
people the alternative is to have a day
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
off where you can celebrate the entire
 
04:45:52.970 --> 04:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
day and have a specific time and
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's time could be different but
 
04:45:56.570 --> 04:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
work it in and then bring the children
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
into that scenario so that they can
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
learn what self-governance is all about
 
04:46:05.208 --> 04:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
what small D democracy having a republic
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
is indeed all about
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the time issue and that one is
 
04:46:12.650 --> 04:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
the obvious one and just so you're aware
 
04:46:15.410 --> 04:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
the reason our federal elections are on
 
04:46:17.448 --> 04:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
Tuesday was
 
04:46:19.850 --> 04:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
um the best effort by our Founders I I
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
teach American government and Community
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
College or I haven't for for several
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
semesters and they did that
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
intentionally because this was a time
 
04:46:30.170 --> 04:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
when we didn't have such a thing as a
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
nine to five office job everyone was a
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
farmer people were farmers and everyone
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
went to church so if everyone Farms but
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
then everybody goes to church on Sunday
 
04:46:41.930 --> 04:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
you take Sunday you give people one day
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
of travel because travel was slow back
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
then and then we held our elections on
 
04:46:49.368 --> 04:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so the framers did their
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
absolute best to have elections on a day
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
that was were the most accessible it was
 
04:46:57.170 --> 04:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
the most accessible for the most people
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
we should be duplicating that intent
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
today to get as many people involved in
 
04:47:05.570 --> 04:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
voting as possible
 
04:47:08.690 --> 04:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I would just add with all of the
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of unrest and unhappiness that we
 
04:47:14.810 --> 04:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
see on both in both political spectrums
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
with our government government that a
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
lot of that can be addressed by making
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
sure more people's voices are actually
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
heard people will not feel as
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
unrepresented as they do by their
 
04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
government if more people have a say in
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
that government
 
04:47:33.410 --> 04:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
so that's the turnout piece the actual
 
04:47:35.208 --> 04:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
time to turn out but there's another
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
reason that Puerto Rico
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
um in their election day holiday is so
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
important and that is it's not simply a
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
day off it is a holiday in the truest
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
sense they celebrate democracy they
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
celebrate the idea of self-governance
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
the the fact that they get to have a say
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
and in the irony of course being that
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
they get to have a say far less than we
 
04:48:00.650 --> 04:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
in the states do uh in the action in an
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
actual state but they still celebrate
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
they celebrate it with things they call
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
caravanas which are these parades
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm imagining for election day
 
04:48:12.530 --> 04:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
holiday it's not simply a day off I'm
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
thinking of things like barbecues and
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
parties and debates and mock elections
 
04:48:19.250 --> 04:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
and things that really truly celebrate
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
the idea that we get to have a say in
 
04:48:24.170 --> 04:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
our government which was truly radical
 
04:48:26.990 --> 04:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:29.570 --> 04:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
and if you think about it as a holiday
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
any type of holiday approaches you as a
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
work working person you're aware you're
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
more aware of that day because it's a
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
day that you have off so it's marked on
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the calendar it's coming up you know
 
04:48:42.410 --> 04:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
that it's coming you're starting to make
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
plans with family you're making plans
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
with friends
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
so Fourth of July a day that we have to
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
celebrate the creation of our country
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
the creation of our great experiment in
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
self-government Memorial Day a day that
 
04:48:58.850 --> 04:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
we celebrate the people who died for our
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
democracy Veterans Day a day that we
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
celebrate the people who fight for our
 
04:49:05.930 --> 04:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
democracy President's Day a day that we
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
celebrate the people who have served our
 
04:49:10.730 --> 04:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
democracy we have all of these days and
 
04:49:13.490 --> 04:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
more Columbus Day we can argue is the
 
04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
day that is celebrating the discovery by
 
04:49:19.010 --> 04:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
Europeans of the new world which led to
 
04:49:22.128 --> 04:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
us having our democracy and our great
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
experiment in self-governance so all of
 
04:49:26.208 --> 04:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
these days we have off to celebrate the
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
idea of self-governance but the day that
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
we actually do the self-governance we
 
04:49:33.890 --> 04:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't have off does not make sense to me
 
04:49:36.890 --> 04:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
so I think setting it aside as a day
 
04:49:39.050 --> 04:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
onto its own where we know it's coming
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
up we see it in the calendar we know we
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
have it off
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
um will really help instill the Civic
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
discourse and the Civic engagement we
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
all believe we should have more of in
 
04:49:52.190 --> 04:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
so I want to get into the bones of the
 
04:49:55.020 --> 04:49:56.868 align:start position:0%
so I want to get into the bones of the
bill

04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
so the first paragraph is the existing
 
04:50:03.050 --> 04:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
paragraph on state holidays and
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
um it turns out that election day is
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
already in our list of state recognized
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
holidays which got me searching for why
 
04:50:13.730 --> 04:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
the heck is it the only day that of the
 
04:50:15.410 --> 04:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
list in the paragraph that we don't
 
04:50:17.570 --> 04:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
actually have off
 
04:50:19.610 --> 04:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and it turns out that there was no
 
04:50:21.288 --> 04:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
actual definition for what this list
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
meant so there was a list in our rsas of
 
04:50:25.610 --> 04:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
what state holidays were the list of
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
state holidays but no description of
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
what that actually meant what happens on
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
a state holiday
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
so I created that description and I
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
described what currently happens on
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
holidays such as Christmas or
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving Veterans Day and all the
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
days that I already listed Washington's
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
birthday Independence Day all of these
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
are already listed so essentially I say
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
that public offices to the extent that
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
they're not necessary close down on that
 
04:50:54.718 --> 04:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
they're not necessary close down on that
day

04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
that includes schools many schools are
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
already closed on Election Day because
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
those locations are polling places
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
anyway but uh but I am very clear to say
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
first of all that if the governmental
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
unit be it a county a a municipality
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
what have you decides that
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
um a function is necessary then that
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
obviously doesn't close so we're not
 
04:51:19.490 --> 04:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
closing for example uh police
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
departments fire departments things of
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
that nature we're also not closing
 
04:51:25.610 --> 04:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
anything that's required to run the
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
elections obviously that goes without
 
04:51:29.868 --> 04:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
saying and then finally nothing in this
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
would interfere with any particular
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit negotiating for a
 
04:51:37.490 --> 04:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
different day instead of they can
 
04:51:40.368 --> 04:51:40.378 align:start position:0%
negotiate whatever days they like
 
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
um so that only affects the public
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
sector the effect of this is essentially
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
a year without any election and then
 
04:51:51.170 --> 04:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
we'll have a year with a primary and a
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
general so on average you get one day a
 
04:51:58.368 --> 04:51:58.378 align:start position:0%
year the effect is one school day
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
per year one snow day per year right
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
that is the equivalent which really
 
04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a financial impact you may
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
argue it has a productivity impact
 
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
because you're still paying people and
 
04:52:12.890 --> 04:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
they're getting a day off that since
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
that is effectively paid except for the
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
hourly workers but I would argue a day
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
where people are coming in late leaving
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
early or taking long lunch breaks in
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
order to vote isn't a terribly
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
productive day anyway and you're saving
 
04:52:26.330 --> 04:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
on overhead in hourly employees anyway
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a wash which is probably
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
why it does not have a fiscal note
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
um having said that this touches all
 
04:52:35.448 --> 04:52:35.458 align:start position:0%
everything I've gone through so far does
 
04:52:37.550 --> 04:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
not touch the private sector whatsoever
 
04:52:39.650 --> 04:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
of course we do not ever mandate that
 
04:52:41.150 --> 04:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
the any private sector any private
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
company close
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so gas stations restaurants all of
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
those things are already able to be open
 
04:52:49.128 --> 04:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
on days like Christmas anyway I do say
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the last paragraph that all employers
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
shall when practicable allow employees
 
04:52:56.208 --> 04:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
up to three hours away from work which
 
04:52:58.310 --> 04:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
would be unpaid there's no requirement
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
to pay them to cast ballots in those
 
04:53:00.840 --> 04:53:02.030 align:start position:0%
to pay them to cast ballots in those
elections

04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:53:02.040 --> 04:53:05.530 align:start position:0%
elections
so

04:53:05.530 --> 04:53:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.208 --> 04:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to add and this is
 
04:53:10.368 --> 04:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
only because in a year past when I
 
04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
introduced this I had um
 
04:53:15.490 --> 04:53:15.500 align:start position:0%
someone from the Teachers Association
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
speak and support and that was the year
 
04:53:20.330 --> 04:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
that we dealt as the body with another
 
04:53:22.368 --> 04:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
issue that dealt with schools and that
 
04:53:24.050 --> 04:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
is the concept of guns and schools
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
versus guns at polling places and he
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of my bill because
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
this solves that particular problem
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
because if you don't have children
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
present at the schools then you don't
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
have to worry about guns being at the
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
schools while children are present and
 
04:53:40.250 --> 04:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
you don't have to you know worry about
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
restricting the the ability to carry
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
guns so I think I've touched on pretty
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
much everything so I'll I'm happy to
 
04:53:50.270 --> 04:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
I I would just like to say that I notice
 
04:53:55.128 --> 04:53:55.138 align:start position:0%
you don't include the local elections
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
yes I do not include they do matter
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and I it would be extremely
 
04:54:04.610 --> 04:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
onerous to do that because every
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
municipality has a different day of
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
local elections so if it was something
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
that the committee did you know feel
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
strongly about I would absolutely
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
support doing that
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
for representative Reed
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Jim Gerhart
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:54:26.930 --> 04:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
the people that I know that don't vote
 
04:54:28.368 --> 04:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
they're intentionally not voting because
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
they don't believe there's any
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
difference between the parties
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
especially at the federal level so I
 
04:54:34.970 --> 04:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't know how this would really affect
 
04:54:34.980 --> 04:54:36.410 align:start position:0%
don't know how this would really affect
that

04:54:36.410 --> 04:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:38.750 --> 04:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and then okay so that's my comment on
 
04:54:43.490 --> 04:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
that thank you other quick any questions
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative for coming in and
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
testifying um my question for you is you
 
04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
gave a really beautiful description of
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
what you would love this day to look
 
04:54:52.680 --> 04:54:53.690 align:start position:0%
what you would love this day to look
like

04:54:53.690 --> 04:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:54:56.090 --> 04:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and it certainly sounds like a great
 
04:54:57.288 --> 04:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
thing but I'm not sure how your bill
 
04:54:59.208 --> 04:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that
 
04:54:59.218 --> 04:54:59.930 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that
um

04:54:59.930 --> 04:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:03.490 --> 04:55:03.500 align:start position:0%
coming from a specific sector of
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
society we work through all of the
 
04:55:08.448 --> 04:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
holidays all of them
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and as a part of the private sector
 
04:55:12.770 --> 04:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
for us a lot of times these kind of
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
things seem like we're paying for
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else to have a day off and gain
 
04:55:18.050 --> 04:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
an advantage essentially they've got
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
more access to the polls than
 
04:55:21.170 --> 04:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
potentially we do
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
um what feedback would you give from
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
that perspective thank you I'm uh I'm
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
not sure what you mean by paying for
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
other people because typically those
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
positions are tax funded so if we're
 
04:55:35.090 --> 04:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
closing like Town Offices State offices
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
those people are getting paid through
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
tax dollars we typically pay those taxes
 
04:55:41.868 --> 04:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
04:55:44.448 --> 04:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
um while I do give the private sector
 
04:55:46.970 --> 04:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
three hours to go vote so that's already
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
an improvement for the private sector if
 
04:55:50.448 --> 04:55:50.458 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like kind of
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
broader culture stuff so let you can say
 
04:55:56.090 --> 04:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
Christmas Day for example almost all but
 
04:55:59.208 --> 04:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
not all private sector companies close
 
04:56:01.368 --> 04:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
on Christmas day
 
04:56:03.170 --> 04:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
um why is that there's no mandate that
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
they close it's cultural so
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think the first one not specifically
 
04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
with Christmas because it's been with us
 
04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
for a very long time but in general
 
04:56:14.570 --> 04:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
Banks and other kind of like
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
white-collar jobs those places tend to
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
like follow the public holidays and so
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
they start to close then you would see
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
more and more kind of businesses until
 
04:56:26.330 --> 04:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
you reached like I doubt that a lot of
 
04:56:29.570 --> 04:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
retail would close or what have you but
 
04:56:31.850 --> 04:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's a process because as more
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
people start to have the day off there's
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
more demand for other people to have the
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
day off to enjoy in the activities that
 
04:56:41.090 --> 04:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
that segment gets to enjoy in so when
 
04:56:42.350 --> 04:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
you have a large percentage of having
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
the day off then you're going to start
 
04:56:46.368 --> 04:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
to see events concerts in the park
 
04:56:49.368 --> 04:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
barbecues fireworks things like that and
 
04:56:51.530 --> 04:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
so then there's more reason for those
 
04:56:54.050 --> 04:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
people to negotiate either privately or
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of broader in the broader
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
culture have those days off together
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just just as um
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
feedback to that I suppose um
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
some some people myself included might
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
feel that actually as more people have
 
04:57:13.550 --> 04:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
that time off it creates more work for
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
certain sectors that are actually
 
04:57:17.690 --> 04:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
providing the services that everybody
 
04:57:20.810 --> 04:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
else is and just enjoying thank you and
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
and as I have in the bill nothing so as
 
04:57:25.850 --> 04:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
there's pressure it also improves so if
 
04:57:27.770 --> 04:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
you're in a sector that for example has
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
a union
 
04:57:31.490 --> 04:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
you can negotiate and you have more
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
leverage to negotiate to have a day off
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
even if that day has to be a different
 
04:57:38.030 --> 04:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
day if you're in a sector that
 
04:57:40.550 --> 04:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
specifically needs to fill in when other
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
people have the day off you can
 
04:57:44.090 --> 04:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
negotiate for a separate day off but at
 
04:57:45.650 --> 04:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
any rate you will have three hours off
 
04:57:49.128 --> 04:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
so it in any any way you slice this it
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
is still an improvement for the vast
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
majority of people to have a more access
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
but be more cultural support and I will
 
04:57:57.610 --> 04:57:57.620 align:start position:0%
just add as a comment to the previous
 
04:58:01.010 --> 04:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
comment that whilst it is true and I
 
04:58:02.930 --> 04:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
would agree to a large extent with the
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
people that you may associate with that
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
don't be able that aren't able to turn
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
out or don't turn out because they don't
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
feel like they have a lot of choice and
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
there are in fact reforms that can help
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
help with that significantly that this
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
is still a barrier for a lot of people
 
04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
and a cultural barrier and as we start
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
to celebrate the idea of self-governance
 
04:58:22.670 --> 04:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
and civil discourse and discourse with
 
04:58:25.010 --> 04:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
people that we disagree with prime often
 
04:58:27.288 --> 04:58:27.298 align:start position:0%
times but able to do so in a civil way
 
04:58:28.850 --> 04:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
in a way that actually furthers our
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
apology policy that more and more people
 
04:58:32.750 --> 04:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
will start to feel like their votes
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
actually matter and maybe having more
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
people makes the two parties listen to
 
04:58:40.368 --> 04:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
us more if more people vote so that's
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
what I would say to that
 
04:58:43.490 --> 04:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much for your answer
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
um hi I'm representative Gallagher again
 
04:59:05.400 --> 04:59:06.288 align:start position:0%
um hi I'm representative Gallagher again
um

04:59:06.288 --> 04:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:06.298 --> 04:59:07.730 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:59:07.730 --> 04:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think representative Reed did a
 
04:59:13.090 --> 04:59:13.100 align:start position:0%
pretty good job preventing presenting
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:59:16.550 --> 04:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'll try not to repeat here and
 
04:59:18.530 --> 04:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
just keep it short but I think it's a
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
good idea and I swear that I've had this
 
04:59:23.690 --> 04:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
idea independently before I'd ever heard
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
of anyone seriously proposing
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
legislation for it so
 
04:59:28.980 --> 04:59:29.690 align:start position:0%
legislation for it so
um

04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:31.550 --> 04:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it's that's something I've been
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about for a while
 
04:59:38.090 --> 04:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I I definitely love election days
 
04:59:41.208 --> 04:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
um you know just the chance of going to
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
the polls and
 
04:59:45.890 --> 04:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
seeing people I don't really see any
 
04:59:49.128 --> 04:59:49.138 align:start position:0%
other time of the year there
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
um it already is kind of like a holiday
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
04:59:54.530 --> 04:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
having some recognition from the
 
04:59:56.448 --> 04:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
government that for many people is like
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
a holiday
 
04:59:57.600 --> 04:59:58.910 align:start position:0%
a holiday
would

04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:59:58.920 --> 05:00:01.190 align:start position:0%
would
um

05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
would mean a lot to people
 
05:00:04.378 --> 05:00:04.970 align:start position:0%
would mean a lot to people
um

05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:04.980 --> 05:00:06.948 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah please support this bill and I'll
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:00:12.650 --> 05:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:00:12.660 --> 05:00:14.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:00:17.708 --> 05:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
uh no not today
 
05:00:30.650 --> 05:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the committee I feel
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
like everything that I was going to say
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
was covered so I guess I'm just going to
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
keep this really short
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really sure what I can add
 
05:00:44.810 --> 05:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
except uh as a mom specifically one who
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
works seven days a week
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
this just kind of seems like a
 
05:00:50.208 --> 05:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
no-brainer to me if our goal is to
 
05:00:52.090 --> 05:00:52.100 align:start position:0%
accommodate robust and participate
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
participatory elections with as much
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
input from as many people as possible
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and there is such thing as a
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
designated holiday I think that this
 
05:01:04.970 --> 05:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
makes sense this is what it should be
 
05:01:06.850 --> 05:01:06.860 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean that's basically what
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
everything else thank you very much are
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:17.690 --> 05:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any I will close
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
in that case we are
 
05:01:44.330 --> 05:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
through with our day and there are no
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
full committee activities for the next
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
two weeks I hope everyone will work on
 
05:01:53.050 --> 05:01:53.060 align:start position:0%
the bills we have already heard
 
05:01:56.930 --> 05:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
and go go to session thank you very much
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
