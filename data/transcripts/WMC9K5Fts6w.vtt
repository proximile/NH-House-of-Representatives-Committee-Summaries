00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
of that or it could be 25.
 
00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 align:start position:0%
whatever it is so it was going it
 
00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 align:start position:0%
initially was going to be
 
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
um it was a percentage
 
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
your amendment is leaving it
 
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.470 align:start position:0%
your amendment is leaving it
open

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
for discussion
 
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
on those funds that have not been
 
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
on those funds that have not been
reimbursed

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i think i think the intent here
 
00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
was to avoid the duplication of benefits
 
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh concern that had been raised by the
 
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh concern that had been raised by the
uh

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
homeland security uh and i think that's
 
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
where the to the extent they're not
 
00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal benefits comes from
 
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
but what i think this may also do
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
is open up
 
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
this new statute
 
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
as a mechanism for the governor with
 
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal and council approval to
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
pay assistance not related to a federal
 
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
disaster area so i think it makes it
 
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
quite broad in my in my interpretation
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if that's the intent
 
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think your microphone's on sorry
 
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
i think that was a concern we have with
 
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the bill itself was very open-ended
 
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
that the governor could just pass on 300
 
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars to you know peoria uh
 
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the fun of it and so the whole bill
 
00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
this this addressed the duplication of
 
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
efforts but i think that um
 
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte and i actually
 
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
both share the concern that the bill
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
itself was incredibly open-ended and i
 
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
don't know how um
 
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
going back to fix that i
 
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
chris sent a copy of the original bill
 
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.749 align:start position:0%
chris sent a copy of the original bill
and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
that was specific to the july and august
 
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
that was specific to the july and august
um

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.670 align:start position:0%
um
disasters

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that does not seem to be in
 
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
the doesn't seem to be in four or nine
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
but it was in the original bill
 
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so i think we've i think we wanted to
 
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.910 align:start position:0%
um so i think we've i think we wanted to
um

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
not not just limit it to these two
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
um and that's that was one of the
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
the way it did
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah in which case it is so open-ended
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
that the governor could just
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
allot any amount of money to any
 
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
allot any amount of money to any
municipality

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
if well
 
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.869 align:start position:0%
if well
yeah

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
let's let's take a look at the
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that i
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
put in and i think that
 
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.190 align:start position:0%
put in and i think that
hopefully

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
this has kind of narrowed the scope
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
of of what we're doing
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
well if you if people are in agreement
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
with my amendment
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
then i think we can
 
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.350 align:start position:0%
then i think we can
just

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
what says a municipality may apply to
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
the division of homeland security and
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
emergency management that's the state
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
agency yeah that's the state
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
the only state funds it's only state
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
not to exceed
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
so tell me again what that means in
 
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.349 align:start position:0%
so tell me again what that means in
vernacular

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
vernacular
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
what that means is that
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
fema will pay will
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
reimburse the community at whatever
 
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
reimburse the community at whatever
percentage

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
75 or 90
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
and then the community could ask for
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
half of the match so if it's
 
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.230 align:start position:0%
half of the match so if it's
12.5

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
12.5
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
or 5
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
but that's what that 50 means is the
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
half of the match
 
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.350 align:start position:0%
half of the match
for

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
for
eligible

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
eligible
for

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the non-federal share of projects
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
that were eligible so they payment as
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
paid and now the community is saying oh
 
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.270 align:start position:0%
paid and now the community is saying oh
i

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and the reason the reason that we
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
homeland security in there is because
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
they will
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.909 align:start position:0%
 
something

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
sorry but this is good this is we will
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
create a rule
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
because the intent of sue prentice's
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
yeah and i guess my i wanted to make
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
sure that i understand division of
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
homeland security and emergency
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
management is the state agency not the
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal so that was mm-hmm
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
is it catherine
 
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
is it catherine
okay

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:26.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
just a second i'll be with you one of
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the things that jen explained
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.150 align:start position:0%
is that
fema

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
fema
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
let's say you replace a culvert okay and
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
you complete that work
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
fema will pay you for that work
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
next month
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
i know another caller then they will pay
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
the community could then apply
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
for money for the first culvert
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay once it's completed once fema's
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
gives you the money
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then you could apply for the second
 
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
and then you could apply for the second
culvert

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
culvert
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
but we would you know or it could be
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
five years from now
 
00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
five years from now
when

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
culvert that you had to replace
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
gets replaced
 
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
gets replaced
and

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
fema is all reimbursement correct
 
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.629 align:start position:0%
fema is all reimbursement correct
so

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the town has to put out the money
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
complete the project and then fema will
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
reimburse the town
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
and they can get the money through 409
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
as a loan
 
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
as a loan
right

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
so the way this is reading
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
i don't see that there's a potential for
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
duplication of effort
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
so we don't need is that the way am i
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
reading it correctly that way because
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's how i read it so we don't need
 
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
that's how i read it so we don't need
15.50

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
15.50
 
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
15.50
because

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
that would be my
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.870 align:start position:0%
that's correct
okay

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
if i understand
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
i've learned more about fema in the last
 
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.949 align:start position:0%
i've learned more about fema in the last
three

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
i mean you know i knew what the letter
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
but as i understand a fema comes in
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
and identifies the projects that will
 
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
and identifies the projects that will
qualify

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
up front
 
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
up front
okay

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
okay and so the towns know
 
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.230 align:start position:0%
okay and so the towns know
which

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
projects are going to be approved
 
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.389 align:start position:0%
projects are going to be approved
now

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
if you decide you want to put
 
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
if you decide you want to put
butterflies

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
butterflies
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
on the culvert
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
then fema may not pay for the
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
butterflies on the culvert
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
but they will pay for
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
you have to follow the fema public
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
assistance guidance right
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for reimbursement of disaster
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
projects what i'm saying is that may not
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
always be
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
you may not always be able to do that in
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
the middle of an emergency and you're
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
trying to get going
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
yeah remember
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
this is not
emergency

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know the emergency is
 
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.550 align:start position:0%
you know the emergency is
that

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
loan that you ask
 
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
loan that you ask
for

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
for
emergency

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.069 align:start position:0%
emergency
right

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
whatever time period right and fema
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
defines emergency work and the
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
definition of emergency work and it's a
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
category of reimbursement
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then you go on to
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
developing your projects for
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to you know
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
replace this whole road and it's not
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
emergency work it's
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the term is what's
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
what's the turnaround time for you know
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
the point of a disaster and when fema
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
comes in for the emergency work it seems
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
like it's quite short
 
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
like it's quite short
so

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about
 
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.630 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about
gesture

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
gesture
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
we need that threshold requested
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
presidential disaster declaration get
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that and then go back to
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
all those towns that had disasters and
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
start working through their projects
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
identifying what roads what bridges what
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
culverts etc
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
that'll take years so
 
00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
that'll take years so
in

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
this case
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're projecting that challenge will
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
save money this summer so that's a year
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
save money this summer so that's a year
later

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the work that they've been doing is
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
developed into a project and we know
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
what's eligible they followed all their
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
procurement they followed up guidelines
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
etc cetera and you know we'll take a
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
look at all their receipts et cetera et
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
the case of that or
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have we didn't see
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
month after everything happened and some
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the repairs
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
temporary repairs had already been done
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
because we had gut roads
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
and some of those projects where they've
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
already done it we just call it a day
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
have a nice day
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
fast track those so that they can get
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
paid for those projects that are already
 
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.269 align:start position:0%
paid for those projects that are already
completed

00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
and then work on developing the larger
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
culverts bridges
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
how likely is it that a town would go
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
off and do something that would not be
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
approved by fema like you know the
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
butterflies it seems like you're talking
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
about a lot of money you're talking
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
about a lot of safety
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
seems to me the towns would be highly
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
part of it is education of communities
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
of disasters so like cheshire selling
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
counties hadn't seen a disaster for a
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
years so
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the towns
 
00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:06.629 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the towns
know

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
the process etc is
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
extremely important
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
and they may not because of turnover i
 
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
mean we could have gone out and done
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
training however many years ago and
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
they've turned over their entire staff
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
so part of our responsibility at the
 
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:24.949 align:start position:0%
so part of our responsibility at the
state

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that communities
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
understand the fema public assistance
 
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
understand the fema public assistance
program

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
which changes on a
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.550 align:start position:0%

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of there were a lot of questions
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think we need to get those
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
well those are the kinds of things that
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to uh
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know the i guess the problem is if
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
it comes in by individual name then what
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
is doe gonna do to
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
cleanse the names
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%

so

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna do the exact session
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah nine on tuesday
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'll probably have to do
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
and i'll schedule the exact exact
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
session for like
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about division two
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
getting through
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
all of their bills um division one had
 
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.269 align:start position:0%
all of their bills um division one had
three

00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh maybe they've got a few more than
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
this was 10 extra ones
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
