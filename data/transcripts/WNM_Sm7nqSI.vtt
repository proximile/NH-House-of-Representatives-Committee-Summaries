under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%

thank you everyone
 
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 align:start position:0%
the first bill for us to hear about this
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
morning uh first bill for consideration
 
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 262 and I'd like to
 
00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor of this bill
 
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I'm
 
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31.
 
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.210 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31.
um

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 align:start position:0%
the bill HB 262 that I'm bringing to you
 
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
today is a bill that makes good on a
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
promise that I made two years ago two
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
years ago uh I I had a bill I think
 
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bill Marsh may have
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it with me I know he had
 
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
the prior term so it took us two terms
 
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
to to get it into place it is now
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
section 151 colon 12-c I can submit the
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
current statute around if that's helpful
 
00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 align:start position:0%
but but what this statute does
 
00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
essentially is it allow allows an
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
individual to go and order their own lab
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
testing without having a licensed
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner issue an order
 
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
so it was just a little surprising to me
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
to to have the the neuropath Community
 
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 align:start position:0%
come to me naturopath excuse me
 
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
naturopath Community come to me and say
 
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to be added to this
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
bill under where we refer to licensed
 
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners and so so all this
 
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh is and it's a small bill I assure you
 
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 align:start position:0%
uh Dr Murphy it's this very small little
 
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 align:start position:0%
Bill all it does is it is it adds
 
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors to that first list
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
so that they join advanced practice
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
registered nurses and physician
 
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.830 align:start position:0%
registered nurses and physician
assistants

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.270 align:start position:0%
assistants
so

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I I honestly don't really know what
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
the scope practice is on a natural path
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
and how it's distinct from those other
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
providers and so I asked the uh that
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
Community uh to come in and and sort of
 
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
represent themselves in this bill and uh
 
00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 align:start position:0%
because uh I'm I'm do I'm doing this
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
because I said I would not because I
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
know anything on the subject
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
do you have questions for me any
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions something Dr representative
 
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.689 align:start position:0%
questions something Dr representative
Nagel

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
Nagel
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
that or taking my question
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question about the
 
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
setting in which this is located it's
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
not referring to lab testing in the
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
general Community it's listing lab
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
testing and residential care and health
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
care facilities
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
um is that a place that you may not know
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
the answer but is that the place where
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
naturopaths actually practice care now
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious why it's that
 
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.510 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious why it's that
specific

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Nagel you may you may
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
be seeing something I'm not in the in
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
the current legislation chapter 151
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
colon 12-c it it it it says a person may
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
obtain any Laboratory test from a
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
Clinical Laboratory licensed pursuant to
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
151 colon 12 IC and and so the the devil
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
of what the detail is on how a Clinical
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratory is defined is is is buried in
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
in that part of the statute and and I'm
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'm I I didn't dig into that again today
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
because it's already in statute the
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
issue today is a narrow one
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
does this committee wish to add natural
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
paths to the list of light of licensed
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners specified in the
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
opening to the statute
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and I I I frankly not qualified to
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
know if that's a good idea or not and I
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
know that there's so many people here
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
with some substantial clinical knowledge
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
that I'm really comfortable uh deferring
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that judgment to y'all
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
Edwards um just a question
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear that when you
 
00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.390 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear that when you
add

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh naturopaths to licensed medical
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner it is only under this
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
section and does not you know
 
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.490 align:start position:0%
section and does not you know
um

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
also allow or potentially involve other
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
statutes that would be doing other
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
orderings such as you know MRIs x-rays
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
or other studies that they would order
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
would this extend to the ability to
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
order other types of tests elsewhere in
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
the medical system no sir this statute
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
is limited strictly to a self-referral
 
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
on a Diagnostic lab result okay thank
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
you and and and
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
the extent to which they can do more
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
than that is already in law under RSA
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
328-e and and I I don't know what's in
 
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
that statute thank you Miss half from
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
the naturopath is here she can answer
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.029 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
Edwards

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
Edwards um in my understanding of this
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
this is adding it to the section
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
Laboratory Testing without a licensed
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner's order and the
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
licensed medical practitioners
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
explicitly not required for this so this
 
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
is simply adding naturopaths to the list
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
of people who are not required for a
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
prescription is that understanding
 
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
prescription is that understanding
correct

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
hmm I I I I find it odd to say yes
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right this is adding
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
them to a list saying they're irrelevant
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation I don't get it but but
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
I don't need to because they're here to
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
explain why they think that's important
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
but but your assessment is accurate
 
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Edwards
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay I see none so so thank you I don't
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
in my lighthearted way to discuss this
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
bill to be frank with you all to uh I I
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
may have made light of the naturopath
 
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.449 align:start position:0%
may have made light of the naturopath
profession

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:40.459 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
inadvertently I I'm really just making
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
fun of my own ignorance on the subject
 
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
so there's a little self-deprecating
 
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay I also signed up to testify this
 
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
morning and I'm hoping I'd pronounce the
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
gentleman's last name correctly Dr Eric
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
Liu from the New Hampshire Medical
 
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
Liu from the New Hampshire Medical
Society

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
is this on now okay thank you very much
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
for having me here uh my name is Eric
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
Liu I'm an associate professor of
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
pathology at Dartmouth Hitchcock but I'm
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
here testifying on behalf of the New
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society and also the
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Society of Pathologists
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so this piece of legislation are uh
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
would amend RSA 151 colon 12-c to
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
include naturopathic practitioners among
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
those other licensed medical
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
practitioners who would be able to order
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests uh without having
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
approval from a licensed uh physician
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
now there are a few things about this
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
legislation that that we have concerns
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
about that we would like to raise to the
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee's attention and and uh
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully answer questions if you have
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
any uh the first is that the RSA 151
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
12-c pertains to Licensing in the
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
 
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.250 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
setting

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
um as Dr Nagel had uh brought up and now
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's unclear why this legislation is
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
necessary as naturopathic practitioners
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
typically do not work in the inpatient
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
setting um hospitals subject Health Care
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
Providers to credentialing and
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
privileging process to ensure that
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
Personnel working at any given Health
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
Care Facility are qualified and
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
competent to provide that care and that
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
their practice doesn't fall outside of
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
their scope of practice now at this
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
present time the New Hampshire hospitals
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't recognize naturopathic training or
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
licensure for credentialing purposes now
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
we understand that the level of scrutiny
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
for credentialing is typically not as
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
rigorous in skilled nursing facilities
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
and we're uncertain if the naturopathic
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners offer services in that
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
particular setting a concern that we
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
have about that though is that elderly
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
or infirm patients that are admitted to
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
these long-term care facilities might
 
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.449 align:start position:0%
these long-term care facilities might
have

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
um you know impairments that could
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
reduce their ability to self-advocate
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and these patients might be limited in
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
their faculty to determine whether or
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
not certain non-evidence-based workup in
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
therapy is appropriate or desirable in
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
their situation
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire has deemed it
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
appropriate to offer State licensure to
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
naturopathic practitioners but licensure
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
really should not be treated as an
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
indication of scientific legitimacy now
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
according to the uh
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
aansmc the accrediting agency for
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medical colleges there are
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
seven accredited naturopathic schools in
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
North America and I went online to
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
peruse their website and it reveals
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
significant heterogeneity uh in their
 
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.910 align:start position:0%
significant heterogeneity uh in their
curriculums

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
curriculums
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
um and but one thing that's uniform
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
between all of them is that they impart
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
core classes in non-evidence-based
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
curricula centropathic Research
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
Institute and other like-minded
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
organizations have proposed that
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
standard of care treatments as defined
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
by the aanp shall not shall not be
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
construed as synonymous with
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatments rather
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
naturopathic Physicians shall have the
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
broadest latitude for treatment options
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is recognized that advances in
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
medicine shall come from ideas and
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
observations from the astute physician
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and are then validated by the scientific
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.370 align:start position:0%
and are then validated by the scientific
method

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and and so
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
that this there doesn't seem to be a
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
good standard of care for treatment
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
um in in the naturopathic Community for
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
any given disease now furthermore the
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
curricular exposure to basic sciences
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
and other clinical courses which could
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
have grounding in evidence are
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
significantly lacking when compared to
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
other traditionally trained medical
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
practitioners Laboratory test
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
utilization is one of several areas in
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
which there's a very stark contrast
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
between alternative and traditionally
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
based medical practitioners there was a
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
2018 study that was performed that did a
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
review of ordering practices by
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
complementary on alternative medicine
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the United States UK
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
and Australia and they found that
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
consumers were being exposed to poorly
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
regulated diagnostic tests and devices
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
that are being used to make incorrect or
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
misleading Medical diagnoses in many
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
cases leading to inappropriate or
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
harmful treatments and that regulatory
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
oversight of complementary and
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
alternative medicine Laboratory Testing
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
is currently inadequate in all of these
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions including the United
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
States you could start wrapping up
 
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.670 align:start position:0%
States you could start wrapping up
certainly

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
um extensive test utilization and
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary testing ordered by
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
naturopathic practitioners have been a
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
significant problem for a CLIA
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
accredited clinical laboratories in our
 
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
accredited clinical laboratories in our
state

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
um I you the committee should have
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
received another testimony from Dr Mark
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
cervinsky a toxicologist and director
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
for The Clinical Laboratory at Dartmouth
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock that kind of outlies some of
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
those examples so I won't belabor the
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
point but there are a lot of wasteful
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
and often expensive ordering practices
 
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
that are deemed medically unnecessary
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
denied by insurers Laboratories and
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
their Associated facilities are
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
typically left to shoulder the cost so
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
we recognize although there's been a
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
movement for non-discrimination among
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
Health Care Specialists in our country
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
but managing things that are
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different with different
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
approaches such as the coverage of
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
proven therapies but not disproven or
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
unproven therapies is not discriminatory
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
we think that it's sensible and we you
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
know think the committee for listening
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
to my concerns okay thank you very much
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
question so yes representative Weber
 
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.329 align:start position:0%
question so yes representative Weber
foreign

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:40.339 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman welcome
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question my
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
question is simply because we have heard
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
of concern of over use of these
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
laboratory tests
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
if naturopaths can already overuse the
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
testing what is the point
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
of including them here when they're
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
already able to access the testing
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
um that that's a good question I'm not
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
really sure what this purpose is we know
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
that naturopathic practitioners in
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Vermont have been able to order tests
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our orders that we receive
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock come from that
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
area in terms of over over utilization
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
the sheer volume of testing ordered by
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
naturopathic practitioners is is Head
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
and Shoulders above what is typically
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
ordered by a traditional medical
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
practitioner and oftentimes repeated
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
testing like a test that doesn't
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a clinical utility that's
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
based in evidence might be ordered
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
multiple times whereas it might be
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
ordered once by a traditional
 
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.629 align:start position:0%
ordered once by a traditional
practitioner

00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald thank you
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
for being here today
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
um what is what what skin is it off the
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
back of the Laboratories to have to do
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
more tests right I mean somebody's
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
paying for that right they shouldn't I
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
mean are you saying that the naturopaths
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
when they order tests that somehow
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's coming that's money coming
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
out of the pockets of somebody else I
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
mean who's at the end of the day if
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
you're a laboratory you like doing tests
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
like that's what your job is so if
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
somebody's asking you do more tests me
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
that should be like Yay more business
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
what's the skin off their back thank you
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
the laboratory typically eats the cost
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
of the test so in general
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
if an if the naturopathic provider is
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
ordering it through the patient asking a
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
physician to order the test for them if
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
the laboratory doesn't realize this the
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
laboratory Will Bill the test to the
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
insurance company the insurance company
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
will then turn around and say that this
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
test was medically unnecessary and
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
refuse payment in that case we would end
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
up balance billing the patient the
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
patient has been protected from balance
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
billing in the United States and so it
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
will you know they're forced to
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
um you know we're forced to take the the
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
in-network median rate at this current
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
juncture however the patient may or may
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
not have the wherewithal to
 
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
actually pay for themselves or they
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
might not be have the financial means to
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
pay for it there's a lot of testing
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's ordered that might be genetic
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
based that's you know can be thousands
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
of dollars
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
um in in total which you know the
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
patient wouldn't be able to cover by
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
themselves and the laboratory just eats
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
the cost in those situations in the case
 
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
the cost in those situations in the case
where

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
um you know the patient might be a
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid patient the
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
building you know the laboratory would
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
again would not know that and just build
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
to Medicare Medicaid uh and and we would
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
just not get reimbursed
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you doctor for
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
um I understand that this bill is a
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing are you aware that
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
this is adding natural paths to a
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
section that allows individuals to order
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
their own tests without any involvement
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
of any practitioner and explicitly
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
prohibits billing to any third-party
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
payer and also that it does not require
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
the lab to to conduct the test but they
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
may conduct the test are you aware of
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
those points certainly and and the the
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
issue that I have is that the types of
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
testing that are being requested by
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
naturopathic practitioners are really
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
quite different than what a typical
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
individual in the community might order
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
on themselves you know a typical
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
Community person you know just wants to
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
know OG is my cholesterol high or
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
something they might order a couple of
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
tests on themselves
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
um you know which which could be
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
interesting but if you look at the
 
00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
ordering practices that the scientific
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
Community or the clinical laboratories
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
are receiving from naturopathic
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners they run the gamut of of
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
really expensive esoteric molecular
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
testing to to look at you know potential
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
nutritional deficits in patients and and
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
other things like adrenal adrenal stress
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
and insufficiency and other things that
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
don't really have a scientific basis but
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and and
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
um as I'm reading the existing
 
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.289 align:start position:0%
um as I'm reading the existing
statute

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
it refers to the individual
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
May obtain a Laboratory test from any
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
Clinical Laboratory that offers the test
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
to the public on a direct access basis
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
so am I correct in thinking that that
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
way the laboratory's liability liability
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
to have to eat costs is limited by their
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
choice whether to offer direct access or
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
not and if we simply
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
include naturopaths in the definition of
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
people who are medical providers who may
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
order the test we are then obligating
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
the laboratory to provide the test
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
whether they are guaranteed payment or
 
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.510 align:start position:0%
whether they are guaranteed payment or
not

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a lot to unpack
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh so your your question was if well
 
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.669 align:start position:0%
uh so your your question was if well
sorry

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to determine is whether
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
this is actually exactly like the thing
 
00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:14.299 align:start position:0%
that we passed the last time which was
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
putting the onus for payment directly on
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
the person asking for the test
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
so presumably in those cases although I
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
don't know how it's worked out in
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
practice and I don't actually see the
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
direct the the payment language in the
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
statute but I may be missing it
 
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.690 align:start position:0%
statute but I may be missing it
but

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
in that case the laboratory has to First
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
decide that they will offer Direct
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
lab testing which they can decline
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then they get to figure out whether
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
the person can pay for the services
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
and in this case I'm asking is that
 
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.450 align:start position:0%
and in this case I'm asking is that
different

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
from this case does including the
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
naturopaths in the medical practitioner
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
part of the statute create an obligation
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the laboratory
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
to perform the tests
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
because the practitioner has the right
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
to order them
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
independent of whether the laboratory
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
will actually get paid by somebody from
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
doing the tests possibly I'm not
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
entirely sure okay I'm sorry if you're
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
not the right person to ask I'll save
 
00:21:29.649 --> 00:21:29.659 align:start position:0%
that for somebody else thank you
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
in response though it the billing
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
process is incredibly complex for the
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
laboratory and we receive thousands of
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
tests a day I did reach out to our
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
Billings specialist at Dartmouth
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock for the laboratory and asked
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
them about how how it's handled how
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
we're able to differentiate
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners and who
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
um who the bill goes to and they weren't
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
able to tell me off off the top of their
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
head and it's been a few days and they
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
hadn't been able to respond to me yet
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
either so I'm not really sure
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
um you know how that is determined at
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh actually this King yes we have two
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
um my question actually is probably more
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
slanted towards your testimony than it
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
is towards the bill but it's one that
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I think needs clarification based on
 
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:24.020 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
and it's just simply uh
 
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
I have plenty of data points where
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
naturopaths are helpful and I have
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
friends and I and people that I know
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
what's it going to take for the medical
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
community to work hand in hand with the
 
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.730 align:start position:0%
community to work hand in hand with the
naturopaths

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad question I it
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
depends on the scope of practice that is
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
being asked for and whether or not the
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
traditional medical community believes
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
that the scope of practice that they're
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
asking for is within their
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
um you know capability and and you know
 
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
ability to practice safely without
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
harming patients I think that's the the
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
main point
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not really sure if I can
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer broadly
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay I I appreciate your your candid
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
answer and I and I apologize too that as
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
I started this I didn't thank the
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to ask this
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking the
 
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking the
question

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
thank you again another representative
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you again Mr chair
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
um another question you made some good
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
answers before and I thank you for that
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
um and I understand that quite frankly
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
um there's definitely
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
um a negative opinion towards
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
naturopaths within quote-unquote
 
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:46.340 align:start position:0%
mainstream medicine however natural
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
naturopaths do exist and there's a lot
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
of people that really like that
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and you mentioned that hey there's a
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
lot of their stuff that isn't
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but in doing testing
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
right the goal is to get some evidence
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of like a chicken the
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
egg problem like how can they ever get
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence if they're never allowed to
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
do the testing so my question for you is
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
have some sympathy here and just put
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
yourself in their shoes let's say you
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
you you believe in this field and you
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
want it to go on what do you believe is
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
the solution if they shouldn't be
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to partake in this sort of
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
Laboratory Testing what do you think
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
they should do should they have to like
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
get their own lab like build their own
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
labs and do their own tests like what is
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
the alternative or is it just like nope
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
they're out of luck tough thank you
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
I have a point of order Mr chairman yes
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
if I may sure
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me this is entirely up
 
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
to you but it appears to me that we are
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
straying well away from the what's on
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and well into a philosophical
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
argument or exploration perhaps rather
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
than an argument which although it is
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
fascinating doesn't
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
actually impact
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
what is in this bill and we're already
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
significantly behind time so I wonder if
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
you want to limit
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
our discussion to the bill your point is
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
well taken representative Weber uh may I
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
address that Mr chair sure go ahead the
 
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:18.380 align:start position:0%
reason why I asked this is because
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
ostensibly this looked like a bill that
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
I would favor but he's made some very
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
good points that have made me requestion
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
you know question things and I would
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
just like a little follow-up that's all
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
doctor are you able to answer that
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
question it's kind of again off topic a
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
little bit but the the one of the
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
concerns is that they're ordering tests
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't think that they have the
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
ability to interpret correctly
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
um there for example there's a gene
 
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
called methyl tetrahydrate folate
 
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.610 align:start position:0%
called methyl tetrahydrate folate
um

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:48.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
MTHFR is the kind of the the thing it's
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
a gene that's in the pathway of of
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
folate metabolism
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and it's been identified in the
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
scientific Community like a few decades
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
ago as being related to people that have
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
more prone to hypercoagulability meaning
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
forming blood clots that can you know
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
potentially cause you to have medical
 
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.830 align:start position:0%
potentially cause you to have medical
problems

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't have really any
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
significant bearing on on a person's
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
overall metabolism and nutritional
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
um status I guess
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
um but apparently it's been pretty
 
00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:23.419 align:start position:0%
common practice for
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
naturopaths to order genetic testing of
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
this sort
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
um you know on genes like this to do a
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
general biophysical like nutritional
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
status evaluation and which really
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any utility at all so you'd
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
be asking for a test and interpreting it
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
in a weird way that might you know cause
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
the patient to think that they have a
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
disease that they actually don't
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
that I that that's just one example that
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay other questions more related to the
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill I representative McKay
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a very simple
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
question does the medical society
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:07.789 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
I was advised by our society political
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
advisor to take a neutral stance on this
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
bill on the Society of Pathologists on
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
the other hand as opposed to the bill
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if that is helpful to
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
you or not
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
it's helpful in the sense that you're
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
taking no position yeah
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful okay representative
 
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.070 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful okay representative
Merchant

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
the way I look at this if I understand
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
it correctly a natural path can today in
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
the private office order all the labs
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
they want
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
is that correct am I making a correct
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
statement that I'm unsure of in New
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I'm told that's the case in
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont but it I was only informed that
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
this was happening a few days ago and
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I've been on service and busy and I
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't actually know the answer to that
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
because when I'm trying to make a point
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
of here is that
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is not dealing with their private
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
practice as I understand it this is
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
dealing with them when they go to a
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
patient that's being institutionalized
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
or Residential Care
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
when you in those kind of facilities my
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is in order for you to be
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
a provider within it you have to go
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
through credentialing
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
so therefore if you're going through a
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
credentialing at that point in time with
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
that in itself screen out the people who
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
are sort of abusing as you would call it
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
the system because you have to go
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
through that process in order to be able
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
to practice in that environment
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically I I suppose so
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if if they're not able
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
to practice in that setting at the
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
present time whether this is a move to
 
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
increase scope of practice down the road
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:47.810 align:start position:0%
or not
um

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
but that that's kind of just my take on
 
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.890 align:start position:0%
but that that's kind of just my take on
it

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions okay thank
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Michelle
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
half from NHA ND
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounced your last name
 
00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:13.970 align:start position:0%
hopefully I pronounced your last name
correctly

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the sun here we go
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh hello chairman McDonald and members
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Dr Michelle
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
half I am here on behalf of the New
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of naturopathic
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
doctors we represent roughly 150
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors who are licensed in
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
um and I'm hoping I can clarify a lot of
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
questions this is a very simple bill
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
that just corrects a technical issue of
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
us being left off of the bill as a
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
licensed medical provider that is
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
already authorized to order and
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
interpret labs and have we have been in
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for nearly 30 years so we
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
are quite frankly surprised by the
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
testimony of the medical society who
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
we've been working very well with since
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
we were licensed in 1995 and this bill
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
really has nothing to do with our
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
ordering practices although I'm happy to
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
speak on those if we want to go back to
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
the philosophical argument but I'd
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
rather stay on task here
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
um and of Interest I don't believe there
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
are any naturopathic doctors working in
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
hospitals or Healthcare facilities at
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
this time but historically Concord
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital did have naturopathic doctors
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
um practice
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
um so really what we're just trying to
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
do here like I said is correct a
 
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.140 align:start position:0%
technical issue
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
that makes the bill congruent with the
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
naturopathic health care practice law
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
which was passed in 1995 that is RSA
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
328e which again does allow naturopathic
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
doctors licensed in New Hampshire to
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
order and interpret labs so really what
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address is item three
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
um from section 151 colon 12 I see it's
 
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.450 align:start position:0%
um from section 151 colon 12 I see it's
um

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
I could read it if that's useful it
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
states if a Laboratory test of a person
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
is conducted by or under the supervision
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
of a person's other person other than a
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
licensed medical practitioner and not at
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
the request or authorization of a
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
licensed medical practitioner any report
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
of the test results should be provided
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the person conducting the test to the
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
person who is subject of the test and
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
here's the part the sticking point the
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
report shall state in bold type that it
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
is the responsibility of the person who
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
is tested to a range with a licensed
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner for consultation
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
and interpretation of the test results
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
so what I take this to mean is if
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
someone orders their own labs and then
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
they bring them to me because I am not
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
listed as a licensed medical
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner right now as it stands this
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
law lists Physicians which are MDS and
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
dos nurse practitioners and Physicians
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
assistants not naturopathic doctors
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
right so in theory I have to send
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
someone to one of those people even
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
though I am inter I am authorized by law
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
to interpret Labs so this is redundant
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
so again we're just trying to correct
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the technical issue here
 
00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:13.070 align:start position:0%
the technical issue here
um

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's really it thank you so
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time thank you
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for bringing
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
forth this bill and for all of you for
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today happy to take
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Leon thank
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you very much
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
for being here and helping me understand
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
the point of this sure uh the idea that
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
this would allow naturopaths to consult
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
with people who are in uh who need that
 
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.490 align:start position:0%
with people who are in uh who need that
consultation

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
um seems to make a lot of sense you're
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
aware that um that Memorial Sloan
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
ketterings cancer center and Swedish
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
Medical Center all have those integrated
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
plans with oncology and is this to
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
replicate that same model here in New
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire throughout our Community
 
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire throughout our Community
Hospitals

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hospitals
 
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
Hospitals
um

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about that to be
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
honest yeah I know in many other states
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are naturopaths who work in Cancer
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
Treatment Centers of America and other
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital settings
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
um but I don't believe there's anyone in
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are you speaking of New
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you no um we have patients who
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
do go down to Memorial Sloan Kettering
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a matter of whether or not
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
they'd been Consulting here but that's
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
helpful to know that while it's not
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
doing that model it's to allow that
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
access for people right I mean it's
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
really to to allow patients to who are
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
ordering their own labs to bring them to
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
me and say Here's my interpretation of
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
it which you know is was part of my
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
training in naturopathic medical school
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
we all attend four-year accredited
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medical colleges and take
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
national boards Etc so
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
question

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
so if I understand what you're talking
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
about is the interpretation of the
 
00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.049 align:start position:0%
about is the interpretation of the
results

00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
if we simply go back into the statute
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
where it says you can be a licensed
 
00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
or a natural path would that solve the
 
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.250 align:start position:0%
or a natural path would that solve the
problem

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
well we are a licensed medical
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners so but in this part of the
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
statute they are to say we just refer to
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
it and add
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
instead of getting into nuances between
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
this changing it broadly is getting to
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
allow the natural path to interpret the
 
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.530 align:start position:0%
allow the natural path to interpret the
data

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
by just changing it from medical license
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
practitioner or an actual path I
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
understand we're trying to get to this
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
more of a philosophical argument would
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
that be sufficient to what you're trying
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess it would to me it makes
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
more sense to list us as the licensed
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
because we are licensed maybe I'm
 
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.220 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the question
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I may I'm just trying to find
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
a way to weave a needle through the
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
needle I mean perhaps in the future
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
saying any licensed medical provider
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
authorized to do blah
 
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
you know it's a or it's a common thing
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
where we're left off and so we're we're
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and I know other providers are as
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh yes rep Dr Nagel
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chairman thank
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm concerned
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
that I may be straying into
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
philosophical but I'll try not to
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm a physiatrist I work on
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
Integrative Medicine I work with a lot
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
of folks I really believe in what you do
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
um but in an integrative setting we all
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand our abilities and our
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
inabilities like for example in my
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
setting I would never order an MRI of a
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
shoulder because I don't feel competent
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
to interpret the results of that
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
shoulder by law I can order it I can do
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
whatever I want
 
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
whatever I want
um

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's been testimony already about
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about naturopaths abilities to
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
order some very expensive tests and
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
interpret them and I look at this as
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
kind of a consumer protection thing but
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what your response to
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's been a lot of
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
statements already challenging your
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
ability to order these things
 
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.530 align:start position:0%
ability to order these things
sure

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
so again we've been doing this for 30
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
years Laboratory
 
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.170 align:start position:0%
years Laboratory
um

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:05.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh laboratory ordering and interpreting
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
is a large part of our our both our
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
didactic training and our clinical
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
training and naturopathic medical school
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
as you stated we order a lot of labs we
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
have a lot of exposure to Labs we um we
 
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.690 align:start position:0%
have a lot of exposure to Labs we um we
have

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
um really what this comes down to is a
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
difference in the approach to care we're
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the root cause of the
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
issue and often that entails ordering a
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
lot of labs so we can find out what's
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
wrong with people so that we aren't you
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
know throwing darts at a wall in terms
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
of treatment which in the long run saves
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
money saves people from having to get
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
expensive surgeries and be put on
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
expensive Pharmaceuticals
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.650 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of just a difference
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
is in the approach to care
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
um from a state and perspective we are
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
not authorized to accept Medicaid that
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we don't have Medicaid
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
patients where we order labs for them
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
but they're fewer than most practices
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
and we are also not authorized to
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
to take Medicare so we're not ordering
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
labs for Medicare so the cost you know
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
in this case is goes directly to the the
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
person ordering the labs but you know in
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
in other cases is is generally covered
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
by private insurance
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
and follow up
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
um can you do me a favor I really
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
researched this to try to understand
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
what goes in a naturopathic education
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I really couldn't find that can you
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
not now but could you just at some point
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
just share us what that involves with a
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
naturopath education is the curriculum
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm also concerned about disparity
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
between schools and things like that it
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
might be useful if you could email the
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
committee or something like that sure
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do that okay great thank
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um thank you in
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
advance for trying to answer my question
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm the only one that's confused
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
but I'm really confused because I hear
 
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
people not you but I've heard other
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
people about
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns about an increase in
 
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.329 align:start position:0%
expressing concerns about an increase in
um

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
prescribing tests that are difficult
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
that are expensive and difficult to um
 
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.430 align:start position:0%
that are expensive and difficult to um
interpret

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
interpret
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
but I heard you say this only refer this
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
is in a an area of Statute that is about
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
people ordering their own tests and
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
self-paying for those tests and it's
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
only about including natural paths as
 
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.589 align:start position:0%
only about including natural paths as
um

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
someone who will be
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
a profession that will be listed as um
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
a group that can interpret these tests
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
so does it have to do with ordering
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
tests and might it lead to more ordering
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
of tests or is it only for people who
 
00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.630 align:start position:0%
of tests or is it only for people who
are

00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
independent patients who are
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
independently getting tests on their own
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
in this bill is specifically speaking to
 
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:08.180 align:start position:0%
those people
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
I mean in theory it may lead to
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
additional tests but that's the case
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
with many provider you know if someone
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
orders their own labs and then they go
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
to a provider and they say what does
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
this mean the provider may say these are
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
the wrong Labs or we need to do more
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
testing because this is abnormal so I
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't think it necessarily would involve
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
more tests or frivolous labs
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh just because they would be
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
interpreted by a naturopathic doctor
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
see none
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is our own
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
Committee Member representative Leah
 
00:39:53.339 --> 00:40:06.170 align:start position:0%
Committee Member representative Leah
Cushman

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee um in the interest of
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
time I will keep it very brief there's a
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion on the point of this
 
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.089 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion on the point of this
bill

00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping that I'll just hit those
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
points and clarify some things
 
00:40:21.849 --> 00:40:21.859 align:start position:0%
um so it's in the health facility
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
statute because that's where the
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
licensing for labs is so we already
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
passed this bill that people can order
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
their own Labs that went into effect
 
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:32.900 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2023
 
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
naturopaths they they can order labs
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
they can interpret Labs any practitioner
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
who is given Labs that they don't feel
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable understanding from someone
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
and they didn't order those labs they're
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
not going to interpret them
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
um they're going to be brought to
 
00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
someone who knows how to interpret them
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
and if a practitioner doesn't they'll
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
say I'm sorry I can't I don't feel
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable interpreting these Labs
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
whether they're a naturopath or an MD or
 
00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
a do or NP or what have you
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
um so lay people can order their own
 
00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:04.910 align:start position:0%
um so lay people can order their own
Labs

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
Labs
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and as far as like expensive testings
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
and stuff I don't think
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
um you know regulation necessarily means
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
effective we see that with lime testing
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
the Western blot is constant constantly
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
used for lime testing and we know that
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's very inaccurate I served on a
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
commission last year we determined we
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
worked with the state epidemiologists
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
that the tests are unreliable there are
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
independent non-fda approved Labs that
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
are yielding better results that are
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
um letting people know that they have
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
Lyme when the Western blot was not
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive enough to so um that's a a
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
side point but the point is that this
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
just clarifies that naturopaths
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um they are not obligated to
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
to care for a patient who brings them
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
Labs that they ordered themselves
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and that they have a duty you know a
 
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
number four the duty of care it doesn't
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
include that responsibility
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
um to review or act on if the request or
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
authorization of the lab test didn't
 
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
come from them so it's just put adding
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
the protection and I think it's kind of
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
insulting to tell them that they're not
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
MediCal practitioners so we should just
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
say or and after our paths also because
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
they are licensed medical practitioners
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire statute it's a very
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
simple technical change we just left
 
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:25.820 align:start position:0%
them out
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I hope that clarifies what's going
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
on with the Bill thank you
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman yes
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair it
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
sounds like without this bill there's
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
something that they're not allowed to do
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
and then with this bill there's
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
something they will be allowed to do can
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
you just give me a hypothetical
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
situation where currently right now
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
because this bill isn't in effect
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's something they can't do that
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
when this is passed they will be able to
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
do there's got to be something that they
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
currently can't do because it's not law
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
but once this is law they will be able
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
to do thank you
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think the only thing that they can't
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
do is
 
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
I really don't I really don't think
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
there's anything that they can't do
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
without this besides just it clarifies
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
that they don't have a duty to care for
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that patient just because that patient
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
brings them Labs that they that they had
 
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
brings them Labs that they that they had
ordered

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify is
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
there anyone here who wishes to testify
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 262.
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 262 and
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
open the house of the hearing on House
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
Bill 454 and once again recognize its
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record I'm representative
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards Rockingham District
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
um 31 and uh I I I just want to say Dr
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
Murphy you were right
 
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
Murphy you were right
yeah

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm here today to introduce House
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
Bill 454 relative to the membership and
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
Reporting responsibilities of the
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
Examining Board of Medicine
 
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:49.940 align:start position:0%
so what why did this why did this bill
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh come forward to you well
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
um if you flash back about a year or
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
more you may recall the Boston Globe uh
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
looked at a particular physician who
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
practiced both in Massachusetts and in
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh saw that there was
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
a significant discrepancy in how the
 
00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:17.579 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine provided transparency
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
about the complaints against that
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
particular position and so you know with
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
the hot glare of the Boston media on it
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
um it we we the legislature the
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight in in particular thought
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
to have a subcommittee take a look at
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
what the board of medicines practices
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
were and to determine you know to what
 
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.170 align:start position:0%
were and to determine you know to what
extent

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:47.180 align:start position:0%
extent
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
systemically uh we had a problem or
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
systemically we had an opportunity to
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
solve something or if we were okay so so
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine uh task force of
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
the HHS oversight got together I
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
represented another out of them were you
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
on that no no because I've seen you on
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
others but anyways chairman Mark Pearson
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
chaired that and led us through and and
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically what we came to find out is
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
that you know if the Board of Medicine
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
receives a complaint they'll act on the
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
complaint and then they'll determine
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's appropriate to
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
provide the public transparency around
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
that complaint that they've received
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in New Hampshire law
 
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:40.220 align:start position:0%
that requires an individual hospital
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with an internal discipline
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
issue to then go and make that report to
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and so what we
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
found was that the Board of Medicine was
 
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.309 align:start position:0%
found was that the Board of Medicine was
not

00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
reporting or not considering reporting
 
00:46:59.050 --> 00:46:59.060 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
complaints for which it didn't know
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
existed which is not a surprise you
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
can't you don't know what you don't know
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't know that there were these
 
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
internal complaints
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
and so looking at the law I could not
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
find anywhere in the law we could not
 
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
find anywhere in the law where the
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
legislature had directed The Board of
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
Medicine to keep their eye on individual
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital complaints
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
bring that information in under
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
particular scenarios evaluate it and
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
make it transparent to the public
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
through their their reporting procedures
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
if appropriate we never told them to do
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
that and in the Army you never held
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
anyone accountable for a mission that
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
you never gave them so we never gave the
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine the mission to be
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
aware of what was going on in the
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
internal Hospital complaint process and
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
therefore there there was no pathway
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
there was no review process in order to
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
get the uh those internal reports
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
evaluated determined whether or not they
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
were significant enough to be reported
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
to the to the public not all complaints
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
get reported to the public by the way
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a due diligence process where
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
these the Board of Medicine makes that
 
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.690 align:start position:0%
these the Board of Medicine makes that
determination

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
all right so with that large setup there
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
were a couple of schools of thought on
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
what we might do to resolve this this
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
hole that we identified with the board
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
of medicines reporting
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know one proposal was to take the
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine as is and leave it
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
alone but create a superstructure board
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
above it that would evaluate that boards
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine's Competency and
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
whether or not they were accomplishing
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to accomplish
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and and the Board of Medicine is a
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
voluntary board the superstructure would
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
have been a voluntary board and so I I
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
just don't know how that would work in
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
real practice you know why would you do
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
the hard work of being on the Board of
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
Medicine if you know that somebody else
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking over your
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
shoulder and uh and reviewing you so I
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
just didn't like that approach but but
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
that still left us with the problem
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we had never given the Board of
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
Medicine the mission to take a look at
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
these things and so so my approach to
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
solving this as well as the uh as the
 
00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.069 align:start position:0%
solving this as well as the uh as the
co-sponsors

00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Leon representative
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson was
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
um let's make sure that we tell the our
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine that they are in fact
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh knowing about these
 
00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:51.950 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh knowing about these
cases

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh and to go ahead and in some subset of
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
those cases bring them in for review
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
and in some subset of those that they
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
bring into review make a determination
 
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
that even though it was an internal
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital matter it's still significant
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
enough to get to the to the uh get to
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
the public reporting
 
00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:14.510 align:start position:0%
the public reporting
now

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
um so so my Approach was give give them
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
the mission they have they have three
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
non-clinical providers that sit on the
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
board of medicine that that's meant to
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's some public
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy of this whole process so of
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
those three I I what I suggest in this
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill is is that we take one of the three
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
and say okay you're we're going to give
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
you the title and I think the title is
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
in here something about uh you're going
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be designated as the public
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
transparency Advocate and this person is
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to have some skills on workflow
 
00:50:58.089 --> 00:50:58.099 align:start position:0%
and basic you know Communications design
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
and and and that we would let the Board
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
of Medicine with this Mission new
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
Mission and this new
 
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.750 align:start position:0%
Mission and this new
capability

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead and and do their own assessment
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
on how to to interact with the hospitals
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
to get this additional information and
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
to process it through sort of a a an
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
informed funnel process so that not
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
everything that they bring in gets
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
reported out at the other end but that
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's a discipline method to review
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
evaluate and report as appropriate so so
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
this is uh what I would call a light
 
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
approach relative to the heavy approach
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was being debated I don't think we
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
need another superstructure we don't
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
need to add more government volunteers
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
looking at volunteers because next
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
you're going to need volunteers to look
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
at the volunteers who are volunteering
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
so so let's just take what we have make
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
sure that there's Clarity what their
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
mission is and and deal a little bit
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
with the resourcing of it without adding
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money or or weight to that
 
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.849 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money or or weight to that
board

00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what this does
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
with that I'm uh I'm happy to take
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah hi thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have two quick
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
ones uh I see Bill 322 is coming up
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
which is studying
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and what we should
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
do about it so I'm just wondering if if
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
we should wait for that before doing
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
before doing one thing and then maybe
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
changing it when we've actually after
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
we've reviewed
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
um what the bill 322 leads to which is
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine yeah yes sir and I and
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
I assume that your chairman uh already
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
saw that and foresaw that and agreed
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
because we're hearing these bills again
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know in parallel I'm not a sponsor
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
of the other bill so
 
00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.210 align:start position:0%
of the other bill so
um

00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
the the main question is Vermont has
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
just gone through sort of the same
 
00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:04.910 align:start position:0%
just gone through sort of the same
process

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
um with the same concerns that that the
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine was missing a whole
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff that was happening were not
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
coming out until way later and um so I'm
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
just curious as to whether you were the
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
anybody else's has looked at that as a
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
way to begin to think about this
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to recall which testimony
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
we brought in there I've been on so many
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
of these things uh that I it's hard for
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
me to remember all of it but I I I I I I
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I think representative Pearson's
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
here he may be coming up to talk about
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
this bill and representative Murphy you
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
were on that right right so so I I think
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
that was really great that you were on
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
it because being a practicing physician
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
engaged directly with Board of Medicine
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
issues you provided a lot of insight
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
into that that whole process so I think
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
this committee will benefit from that
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
experience and hopefully this bill will
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
advance the conversation
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative for continuing to engage
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
I seem to recall a long conversation in
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
the context maybe of one of the
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree bills last term
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
here's my concern I understand that you
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
have given somebody you've reorganized
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
the board a bit and given somebody the
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
duty to look into the transparency
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
issues however
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this bill that
 
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.329 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this bill that
creates

00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
creates
 
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:52.940 align:start position:0%
and a Duty or even a permission
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
that relates this person with the
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
hospitals who apparently as far as I can
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
read in this bill are still entirely
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
within their rights not to report that
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
to this board so the can you either
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
tell me how this fixes the problem
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to see the
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
stuff they're supposed to be transparent
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
about as I read it or is there a way of
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
amending this so that they can see the
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
data that they're supposed to be that we
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
seem to be looking for that is not
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
available now and doesn't look to me
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
like it will be available under this
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
either so so thank you for the question
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
I think you were on that subcommittee
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
too right so so I I had described this
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a light approach it I don't
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
view this as the full answer this this
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
this to me is uh basically uh getting
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine engaged with the
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
idea that they do have uh some level of
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what's going on in
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
the complaints in the hospitals
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
themselves and gives them a capability
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
to within the Board of Medicine current
 
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.549 align:start position:0%
to within the Board of Medicine current
powers

00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and come up with their own
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
recommendations because they are they
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
are the Board of Medicine they do a lot
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
of this evaluation and Reporting ask the
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine basically to take a
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
look at this challenge of internal
 
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:29.099 align:start position:0%
Hospital reporting and then within the
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
physician culture and physician
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
community and the Health Care system
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
look to the Board of Medicine to
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
recommend a legislative path forward so
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
so I see this as a first step on what
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
might be a two or three step process but
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
rather than have the legislature
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you know basically reach in and try
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
to fix it for them you know I'm I'm
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
trying to make it so that they're aware
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
that we we perceive a potential problem
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit of resource and
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
kind of expect them to come back with
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
with some legislative fixes should that
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
be appropriate if like a voluntary
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
approach doesn't work so so so this is
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
my light hand way of of moving Us in the
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
right direction keeping in mind that
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
we've had a Board of Medicine For What
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years you know and and
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
they've done a pretty confident job
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
generally you know so so I I don't know
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
that this is such an urgent thing that
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
we should as a legislature try to reach
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
in and fix it for them other than to say
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
hey we think there's a problem go figure
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am other questions
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
I I have my own chair at 10 so I won't
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
be able to stick around for any
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
testimony but if there are questions
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
afterwards I'd be happy to address them
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
I I think it's great you got two smarter
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
people from that task force here anyway
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
they also signed up to speak is
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson who is the
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
and a member of Health and Human
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
Services Alumni Association that's
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
correct yes previous chairman of this
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
committee it gets curiouser and curious
 
00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:35.829 align:start position:0%
committee it gets curiouser and curious
sir

00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards spoke to 454 of
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
which I'm a co-sponsor I hope to speak
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
to 322 of which I am the prime sponsor
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
but then there is 655 it is this thick
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
from Eda uh Edna one bill at a time
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative yes sir
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I would like it to be so and among
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
other things this reorganizes the entire
 
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.849 align:start position:0%
other things this reorganizes the entire
oplc

00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:06.530 align:start position:0%
oplc
including

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine who it is what it
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
does and all of that I have a text from
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Michael padmore director of advocacy
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Medical Society
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
where he has taken the part of the Great
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
Big Bill that is relevant to the Board
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and outlines what Edna
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
wishes to do so we've got the battle of
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
the bills and I personally would hope in
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
the next few days before Edna execs this
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
on Friday or has their work session that
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
there can be some coming together
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
to do what I hope the next bill 322
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
tries to do and that's bring the
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
relevant people together sit down and
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
work it out some legislators
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals the Board of Medicine and so
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
on so I'm just simply saying it is even
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
more complex than representative Edwards
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
just mentioned based on what I found out
 
01:00:07.559 --> 01:00:10.430 align:start position:0%
just mentioned based on what I found out
yesterday

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Pearson
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber just quickly the
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
the number of the bill that's in Edna
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
because 650 655 I haven't ah no wonder I
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it thank you I haven't had
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
the chance to find out exactly where in
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
655 the relevant part is but it's in
 
01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:37.130 align:start position:0%
655 the relevant part is but it's in
there

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I want to get back to a question that
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
was asked before because I want your
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
opinion on this um I think the goal is
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
Honorable and I I'm fully aware that
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
there's issues in terms of reporting
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
within individual institutions the Board
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm struggling to understand how 454
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
addresses that and how that will make a
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
difference in that particular issue
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is what apparently brought this
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill forward so I'm curious
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
does this bill have value your name's on
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
that is the bill that is more
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
particularly driven by representative
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
Edwards I signed on to it because in
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
effect it was kind of a Minority Report
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee I had created and I
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to honor that uh the majority or
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
at least what I hope is is the bill
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Merchant
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman welcome back it's
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
good to see you mark
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
what I want to follow up on what uh
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber talked about before
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
in here talks about a true record of the
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
board's official acts my concern is that
 
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of times many things we're talking
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
about are discussed in non-public which
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
become sealed records
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
so in saying that we're trying to get to
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
the transparency of the medical board
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
and what's happening within the medical
 
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.490 align:start position:0%
and what's happening within the medical
community

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
if we can't have access or somehow some
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
summary coming from the non-public side
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
is that going to impact what you have
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
here as far as the public records
 
01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:21.740 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there are certain
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
judgments that should be public and
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
certain ones that should not be for
 
01:02:26.099 --> 01:02:27.049 align:start position:0%
certain ones that should not be for
example

01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine of Massachusetts
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
reported 20 malpractice settlements
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
against the Manchester surgeon in
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
question that's too much information or
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
not enough information how many of those
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements were because of
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
egregious medical misconduct with a huge
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
seven-figure payout and how many of
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
those were the kind of thing most
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
professionals including my wife dread
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
somebody sues for thirty thousand
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
dollars and your insurer says it costs
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
us 50 to defend it we'll give them 30 to
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
make them go away I don't know which is
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
which from what Massachusetts uh
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
reported in New Hampshire reported none
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
of that and what my hope in 322 the next
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill is is that as these things are
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
being discussed there will be criteria
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
as to what should be told and what
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
should be buried the former should be
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
told the latter should be buried
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so this bill the
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
way it's written really doesn't address
 
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
way it's written really doesn't address
that

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
you would wish to speak to
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'm affirming his
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
right to file a Minority Report to a
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you welcome
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question I want to hug the
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
baby very soon okay
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
um do you think it's just generally a
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
good idea to ensure that one of the
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
public members
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
um On The Board of Medicine
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
um should be a transparency Advocate
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
regardless of what's been going on with
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine right now don't
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
you think do you believe that it's just
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
generally a good idea to have that
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
position on the board I think the entire
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
board should adopt good rules of
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
transparency that protect the innocent
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thank you
 
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:50.210 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thank you

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak today is Shane
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
Goulet an attorney for the New Hampshire
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Representatives my name is
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
Shane Goulet I'm an attorney for the
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
certification I'm here today in a very
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
specific capacity as board Council for
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine I'd just like to
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
say at the outright the Board of
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
Medicine takes no position on this they
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted me to come to speak to the
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee to highlight some potential
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
concerns and I think representative
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
Merchant kind of took the win right out
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
of my sales with part of it as it
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
relates to the fact that I'm going to go
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
to the italics here and we're at one of
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
the public members shall be designated
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
as the public transparency Advocate the
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
public transparency Advocate shall be a
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
person who through background or
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
training and without conflicts of
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
interest is capable of exercising
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
systems analysis and providing
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations to improve public
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
transparency of the board
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities under subparagraphs to
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
B and C those two sub paragraphs deal
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
with the complaints and investigatory
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
process the board of medicine its main
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
obligation is public protection they
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously but they also
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
are within the confines of 91a3 which
 
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:15.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna go we have 91a3
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
subsection 2C matters which if discussed
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
in public would likely affect adversely
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
the reputation of any person
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
complaints are discussed in non-public
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
because they are in the complaint
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
process 329 illustrates that further
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
during the complaint process that
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
information is not to be disclosed to
 
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:37.220 align:start position:0%
the public pursuant to their own statute
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
so while taking no position they just
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight and express to the
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
committee that that is a barrier as it
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
relates to what if anything could the
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
public transparency individual stay
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
during these meetings outside it would
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
be basically related to process and
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
procedure which are Illustrated in the
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
rules and the statute of the Board of
 
01:07:00.539 --> 01:07:02.029 align:start position:0%
rules and the statute of the Board of
Medicine

01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say thank you thank
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
you uh questions yes Dr uh
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking this
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
question can you help me understand how
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
having a transparency Advocate with the
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
capability of exercising CIS CIS systems
 
01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:22.849 align:start position:0%
capability of exercising CIS CIS systems
analysis

01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
how that person with that skill would
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
make more information from the hospitals
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
transparent which the hospitals are not
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
giving to the board
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that that necessarily
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
would be the case I think that it would
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
be have to be a value on an individual
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know situation the concern of the
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine was not related to
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
that piece necessarily but to how much
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
Insight the public transparency member
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
could provide from the internal meetings
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
of the Board of Medicine that occurred
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
in non-public not necessarily that piece
 
01:07:58.319 --> 01:07:59.390 align:start position:0%
in non-public not necessarily that piece
representative

01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Merchant
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
oh representative representative Leon
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
um I as you've looked at 93 sorry 91a3
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've seen that there are
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
certain expectations around police
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
officers when sometimes it rise Rises to
 
01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:23.339 align:start position:0%
the level of public concern something
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
that could impact their reputations uh I
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
I see the potential of this of this
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
Advocate as identifying where there may
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
be legislation in the future in order to
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
know where that dividing line is between
 
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:38.420 align:start position:0%
privacy and patient protection
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
do you have any insight as to whether
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's a correct or incorrect
 
01:08:42.299 --> 01:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
that's a correct or incorrect
interpretation

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
well I think without getting into a
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
legal analysis here I'm I'm authored in
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
a very limited scope here today I will
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
say as far as because I've heard it
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
discussed and I hope this addresses your
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
question somewhat
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
um that there is emergent circumstances
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
which necessitate the emergency
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
suspension of a license pursuant to 91a
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
the board is authorized to have
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
emergency meetings and they will
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
emergently suspend an individual's
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
license when there's a determination
 
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
under 541a 29 3 I believe that there is
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
imminent danger to Public Health and
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
life that suspension occurs and that is
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
a public document okay and that
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
individual is then that's done in the
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
next part type ex parte basis that
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
individual then has that opportunity to
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
be heard in 10 days but as soon as that
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
order is made the emerging suspension
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
that is post and that's public document
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
because at that time there was a
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable basis for the board to
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
believe that there was an imminent
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
danger to Public Health in life so I I
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
know that kind of was part of it but I
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
didn't I couldn't do the whole question
 
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative thank you Mr
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you that gets almost
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
all of it um the other question is if
 
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
the that public transparency Advocate
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
um aware of those in issues that may
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
Simply Be residing at the hospital level
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and not coming to the board or if that
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
requires a larger effort to change that
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
would not be seen by that public
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
transparency advocate
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
well I think as far as the hospital
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
piece the board is you know a
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial entity uh making you know
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
judicial determinations on whether or
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
not somebody's license should be
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
suspended and I think five you know 329
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
illustrates a process and procedure that
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
kind of separates the Board of Medicine
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
from that investigatory process to some
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
extent so they can remain neutral
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
Arbiters when it comes to the point if
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
it comes to the point that they need to
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
find misconduct or Institute discipline
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
your presented a merchant thank you Mr
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
having served on the Board of Pharmacy
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
for 10 years they can still understand
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about again
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
non-public versus public
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
I would also say that this issue is not
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
just remained to the Board of Medicine
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's also dealing with where the
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
practitioner practices which is the
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
hospital side there's nothing in here
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
talking about holding the hospital
 
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.570 align:start position:0%
talking about holding the hospital
accountable

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
for the practitioner as well strictly
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine so why are we only
 
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the Board of Medicine and not
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that I have the ability
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
the board took a limited vote as to what
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
my testimony could be I could bring that
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
back to the Board of Medicine
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um we meet every month the first
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of every month and try to
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
ascertain their position on on what
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
their take on requiring a hospital to
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
report would be
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
um I know that they're they're in favor
 
01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:45.140 align:start position:0%
of transparency in general
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
so and which is why they're taking no
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
position but just wanted to speak I'm
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I couldn't answer that that's fine
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
in totality mail the committee that
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
would be great okay if you're able to do
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you other questions
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
I see no other questions I'm sorry yes
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm obviously a very big fan of
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
transparency or why I've signed on as
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor in the next bill 322.
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
um but I'm trying to think about
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
mechanically in a hospital
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
how a transparency Advocate would be
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
able to get access to complaints which
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
are usually internally you know
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
generated in dealt with in a hospital
 
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
generated in dealt with in a hospital
setting

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Pearson said that you
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
know this is not available to the Board
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
of Medicine suspensions and you know
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
privilege revocations are you know are
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
reported to the Board of Medicine but
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
complaints are not for an obvious reason
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand or maybe you
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
could explain me how an advocate could
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
actually penetrate to get the complaints
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
and have them somehow aired from within
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
the hospital to this advocacy person
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
um necessarily how to answer that
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
question because they're you know the
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine has authority over
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
very specific things
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
um as Illustrated within 329 most of
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
which relates to the licensure
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
qualifications the investigatory process
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
and discipline their authority to
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
enforce anything over third parties for
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with their own
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
obligations under the statute is
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited and I'm speaking in a
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
general colloquial sense because that
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
there are only certain specific
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
individuals who are obligated to report
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
whether it be insurance companies
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
malpractice claims the court system for
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
civil uh litigation that's been filed
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
for medical malpractice claims there are
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
obligations on those individuals as
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
currently constructed under 329 but the
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
enforceability of the Board of Medicine
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
well first of all whether or not there
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
is information that they know exist and
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
isn't getting
 
01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:03.739 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't know that and if they did
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
have that information the authority to
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
do anything about that I don't see
 
01:14:09.719 --> 01:14:11.390 align:start position:0%
do anything about that I don't see
currently

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
um within their statute necessarily that
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that kind of answers the best I
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
can they kind of authorize me to talk
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
within the constructs of 329 in their
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
specific position on this bill so I'm
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
sorry that I couldn't give you
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
everything no thank you somewhat of a
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question but thank you okay
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%

for the following boat were the exact
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
same but I would like to testify if
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
there was any further follow-up as to
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
that bill as well okay if you want to
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
pull out a pink card you can just find
 
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much thank you
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh who wishes to testify I
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
have no other people signed up
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 454. okay
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I am gonna
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry yes sir
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
sponsors and co-sponsors can get up and
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
testify however under certain chairman
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it has been that sponsors and
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors cannot question
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
the person testifying and uh and some
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
have not so I thought since I'm a
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and not somebody else I'm is
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
there it's the question is what what is
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
your that's why I think I should I can
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
answer that representative Weber uh we
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
had an amendment to house rules that was
 
01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
voted on so it's now not up to the
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
chairs it is in-house rules and the
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
sponsors and co-sponsors may choose if
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
they are going to speak in which case
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
they may not question or not speak in
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
which case they may question that is
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
different from our practice before but
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's up to them they can do one or the
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
other but they can't double dip thank
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
so needless to say I've talked at Great
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
length with my pcps especially and the
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
motto I've adopted now over several
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
months is I want to protect the innocent
 
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
who are accused and expose the guilty
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
tooth those are two things which are
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
very important to me I'm going to skip a
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Jeffrey soloway who for
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
six years was a member of this committee
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
and for I think two years at least was a
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
member of DHHS oversight with me was the
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
one that got the ball rolling on all of
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
this about transparency and why does
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts report certain things on
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
their Board of Medicine website that New
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not especially when
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
persons in question are from New
 
01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.930 align:start position:0%
persons in question are from New
Hampshire

01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
we met as a subcommittee on the fly on
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
October 3rd 17th and 31st knowing that
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
submit legislation we've got to do it
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
we came to a couple of conclusions in
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
we were told that investigations of
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
complaints received by the Board of
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
Medicine were given to a part-time
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer retired physician while
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
commending him for his service and
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
having no evidence that he was not doing
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
his job well we wondered if the
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
investigative arm of Board of Medicine
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
needed additional Staffing and
 
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
compensation for time and expense
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
this question is being addressed by
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
House Bill 445 that will give to oplc
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to keep some of its funds
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
presently the funds are lapsing when
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
they receive monies from people renewing
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
licenses and I know because I've signed
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
the checks not all of that money is
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
expensed by the boards in other words
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
they make a profit that money goes back
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the general fund 445 asks the
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
question wouldn't it be good for oplc to
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
keep some money so that when something
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
arises quickly we don't have to wait for
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
the whole budget process we could hire
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
we could have hired an investigator a
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago if that was
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
necessary so we saw the funding as one
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the issues and then we looked at the
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
question of the rules
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
what are the rules for what should be
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
reported to the public we can be told
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
well the law says this and that with the
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislature we can change those laws
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
what needs to be reported Massachusetts
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
obviously has a different way of doing
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
it in their Board of Medicine than we do
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
is there way better is our way better
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
could we examine the way could we
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
examine has there been breaches of the
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
rules that are good have there have been
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
occasions where we think the rules need
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
to be tweaked that second conclusion has
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
led to the bill before you 322 the bill
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
would take that short-lived
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
temporary subcommittee
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
that looked at these questions under the
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
auspices of DHHS oversight and turn it
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
into a study committee that would look
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
at all of these things bringing relevant
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
people together
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
and ask the question other rules what
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
they should be what should be disclosed
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
to the public what shouldn't be and I
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
gave an example in response to
 
01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as I the LSR as I turned it in
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
didn't quite
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
get reflected in the bill as it came out
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
so there is an amendment 386 I'll give
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
you all copies of this because you're
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to exec this pretty soon it makes
 
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
a few very brief changes to the bill
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
that you do have before you number one
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
it lowers the number of senators from
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
three to two there's only 24 of them and
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
bazillions of positions they have to
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
fill on committees and a lot of times
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
they just can't be in three places at
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
once it lowers it to two the Senators
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
have thanked me for that also it does
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
something that we do in oversight and
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
that is it also names a few house
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
members as alternates and I see some
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
alternates or past alternates to
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
oversight here this means the alternate
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
comes can participate can do whatever
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
and be raised to the level of a regular
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
member if somebody's absent that's
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
hopeful to get wisdom that's also
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
helpful to make a quorum
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
thirdly I suggested that the committee
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
report to oversight semi-annually and
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
not quarterly there'll be a lot of
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
oversight I mean excuse me overlap
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
between oversight and this committee
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
should it be established
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
fourthly the committee will sunset on
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
June 30th of 2026. this is important I
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
think for a lot of folks that things
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes will sunset and not just be a
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee that is there in his dad
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
uh if you read through the uh people who
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
will be on the committee you will notice
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
something different
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
we passed
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
a law that said
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
on committees like this commissions like
 
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
on committees like this commissions like
this

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
the majority had to be legislators
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
and if we wanted all of these other
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
folks from stakeholder groups to be on
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote we would have to
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
put on a lot more legislators so I
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
worked with OLS and we came up with this
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
thought what if we said we would really
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
encourage somebody from the hospital
 
01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
Association to be there as a regular
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
participant what if we had somebody from
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
and there's the list as non-voting
 
01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
and there's the list as non-voting
people

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
as people however who would come and
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
participate greatly in the process that
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
seemed to pass muster so if you wondered
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
why are these people non-voting that's
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
having

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
just discovered the big uh oplc
 
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
redo bill that Edna has come up with one
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the things I hope to do today and
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is talk with Eda to see
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
what they have in their bill and what we
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
have or I haven't you have and this bill
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh there can be some melding uh I just
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
don't want two things to pass that
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
contradict each other
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
um that's why I'm more winging the
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
testimony is because this is late
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
breaking news
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
I've got a copy for everybody of my
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
original testimony which is not wrong
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
but it just has a lot of stuff in here
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
you don't need to have me say and I also
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
have a copy of for everyone of that
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that I would ask Mr chairman
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
you ask somebody to introduce when you
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
exact with your permission sir may these
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
be passed around absolutely okay go
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
ahead and also representative piercing
 
01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
knife could you make sure you complete a
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um for
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question welcome back again
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
and again and again
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
this seems like uh to me like a little
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a hybrid between a commission and
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
a and a study committee given that it's
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
got other regular uh members but they're
 
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
not voting members and um I like this
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
idea very much
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and I was a little concerned when you
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
said it was sunset in 2026 is your
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
expectation that there will be
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
um concrete ideas for
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
um legislation that might solve some of
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
the problems that people
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
saw when the you know when the specific
 
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
Spotlight article came out and I think
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
it was pretty alarming so
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
can you say what your expectation is
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
about when there'll be some solutions
 
01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.250 align:start position:0%
about when there'll be some solutions
offered

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
offered
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of good work has been done already
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
I've had good conversations with Dr
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
Emily Baker from the Board of Medicine
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
and the hospital Association and all
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
these people you're mentioning here or
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
the bill mentions here as adjunct
 
01:25:59.639 --> 01:26:01.490 align:start position:0%
the bill mentions here as adjunct
members

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
um we're very much part of this process
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
already this is just getting the band
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
back together and frankly before this
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
actually kicks in should this pass and
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
be signed into law over the summer well
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
before then one of the things I hope to
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
do as
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
re-elected chairman of oversight is to
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
get another subcommittee going that
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
replicates this what this bill is doing
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
is giving an official status in law to
 
01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:31.010 align:start position:0%
is giving an official status in law to
that

01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
but a subcommittee can certainly do a
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the prep work and hand things on
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
to whatever committee is signed into law
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
as for 2026 I probably will be chairman
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
of fish and game at that point and uh
 
01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.689 align:start position:0%
of fish and game at that point and uh
um

01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
if we're done we're done if we're not a
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I have a hearing
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
loss Dr Palmer if you could be a little
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic thank you sir so thank
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
one of the pieces that I would love to
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
see incorporated into this and I wonder
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
if you have thought of this is the whole
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
issue of the hospital peer review piece
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm on a hospital peer review committee
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
that happens to be in Vermont and we've
 
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
just gone through a lot of this whole
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
issue about that that the tension
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
between hospitals releasing stuff to the
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and you know at one
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
point it was very heavy-handed they
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanted everything the Board of Medicine
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
which was not going to be practical but
 
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
also would would would quell
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
people reporting things within the
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
hospital which is extremely important
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
because you want to be able to not just
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
out the guilty but also figure out what
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
systems in the hospital aren't working
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
properly so I just wonder if that's
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing specific about a peer
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
review person being on this committee
 
01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.350 align:start position:0%
review person being on this committee
but

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm asking if that would be
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
something that might make sense
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
Dr Palmer when I was reestablished the
 
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:16.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would you like to come
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean you I think a lot of you
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
know that I'm a middle bowl of porridge
 
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
kind of guy and you know I really like
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
to find that sweet spot in the middle
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
when possible and that's what I hope to
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
do here uh no we do not want the names
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
of people outed prematurely if it's a
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
system problem let's fix the system
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
good folks sincerely acting sometimes we
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
need to change the the rules a little
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
bit and good folks will want that people
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
unjustly accused we don't need to know
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
about that the public doesn't need to
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
know about that that needs to be very
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
quietly buried after it was investigated
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
and proven to be a non-issue we're
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
talking about the outrage of people who
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
telephone me maybe some of you when the
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
globe Spotlight or articles came out a
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
few of them in the union leader but a
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
lot of them in the globe when that came
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
out I get phone calls from people who
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
knew the individual in question and by
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the way this individual in question is
 
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:26.540 align:start position:0%
not the only individual whose
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements were not
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
reported in New Hampshire but were
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
reported elsewhere this is not the only
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
one I get a lot of outrage I got a lot
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
of outrage from Physicians remember my
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
wife is a family practice physician I go
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
to their parties they talk to me they
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
say do something and that's what I want
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
this to do is protect the innocent fix
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
the systems and when necessary find out
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
who's doing something
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
egregiously wrong and make it known so
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
the public has better confidence in the
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
medical establishment
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
do I understand correctly that where are
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
you trying to head
 
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
is to the authority of the oversight
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee to form committees and to as
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
part of the responsibility and am I
 
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:26.780 align:start position:0%
correct and that's where you're heading
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
and I should tell you that I have a
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee that I want to bring over as
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
well you're always welcome
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you what I hope to do is have 322
 
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
as amended past so it can be in law
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
that says something that says As A
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature We Care
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
if this sails through and the governor
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
signs it I have a feeling the committee
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
will not start meeting until late summer
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
early fall
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
I want to get going now so I want to get
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
the ad hoc subcommittee back and running
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
to do what this bill asks and probably
 
01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:13.219 align:start position:0%
with most of the people this bill names
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
so that a lot of the work is already
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
done so when this bill is signed into
 
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
done so when this bill is signed into
law

01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work has been accomplished
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
already but I see this two-prong
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
approach the subcommittee is immediacy
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is officialdom this is good stuff
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
I asked OLS because I've used the term
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
committee and commission interchangeably
 
01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:43.460 align:start position:0%
apparently now
 
01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:48.260 align:start position:0%
committee is legislators
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee and non-committee but as
 
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
that clears up my interchangeability
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
problem of terms thank you
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
um does the scope of this bill as just
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
as currently written covered
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
um does it allow the committee to look
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
at conflicts of interest within the
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and if not should it
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
we're looking at rules we're looking at
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
how things are done how things are
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
received how things are evaluated and
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
how things are reported I would see this
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
would have some broad scope
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
and as uh the late excuse me I I just
 
01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:40.699 align:start position:0%
killed him I didn't mean that the great
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
if we dealt with every conflict of
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
interest in New Hampshire half the work
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get done anymore
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
this conflict of interest in this
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest into my back pocket
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
with large denominated money I think
 
01:32:59.159 --> 01:33:01.010 align:start position:0%
with large denominated money I think
sometimes

01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
people who have an interest in an issue
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
can bring things to the table the
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
question is at what level is conflict of
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh thank you chairman
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you it's not really a question
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
I just noticed that we're hearing uh
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
Bill 323 but your amendment is numbered
 
01:33:29.639 --> 01:33:32.390 align:start position:0%
Bill 323 but your amendment is numbered
322.

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
322.
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so that might need to be corrected
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
oh okay 323 is it wonderful I withdraw
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%

my name is David cuzzy with Prospect
 
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
Hill strategies here in town uh this
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
morning before you as the chairman said
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire Society
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
of physician assistants I did send in a
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
letter by email from the from the PAs to
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
everyone uh we're supportive of the bill
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
with uh some what we think are some very
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
simple changes uh we noted that Pas were
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
left out entirely from this bill even
 
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
though its Physicians and PAs are the
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
ones regulated by the Board of Medicine
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh we also noted with some level of
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
curiosity that that nurses were included
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill even though of course
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
nurses are not regulated by the Board of
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
Medicine they have their own
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory structure uh so we would
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
and this is nothing against the nurses
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
um but we would respectfully suggest
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are three places within the bill
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
that have nurses that we would kind of
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh Delete and and add Pas very
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
specifically on page one of the bill
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
line four
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh it currently reads a member of the
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Nurses Association excuse
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
me I'm sorry I got ahead of myself on
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
line 15 uh it it says uh after Medical
 
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
Association the association of nurses uh
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully suggest that that
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
say the New Hampshire Society of
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
physician assistance instead of the
 
01:35:59.930 --> 01:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
association of nurses
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
on line 27 page one uh at the very end
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
of that line it says reports of lapses
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
in physician we would add uh and
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
physician assistance physician assistant
 
01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.129 align:start position:0%
physician assistance physician assistant
practice

01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
I was scribbling while you I'm sorry I
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
started the second one so could you tell
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
us of course my apologies I got line 15.
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
you got line 15 line 27. okay thank you
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
I beg your pardon right at the end where
 
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
it says it it would go uh from line 27
 
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
to 28 it says lapses in physician
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
practice we would say physician and
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
physician assistant practice or
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
physician assistants practice how
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
grammar would be they don't they didn't
 
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:49.940 align:start position:0%
pay me to be an English teacher
 
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:52.940 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
with your Indulgence Mr chairman on page
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%
two line four
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh where it's as a member of the New
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nurses Association we would
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that that be
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
changed from The Nurses Association to
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Society of physician
 
01:37:07.199 --> 01:37:08.990 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Society of physician
assistance

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
if there's a desire to keep nurses
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
involved that's obviously a policy
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
decision I think what's most important
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the Pas is that they're included as
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
a regulated entity by the Board of
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
Medicine and that's all I have Mr
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
chairman of course I'm happy to take any
 
01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.090 align:start position:0%

earlier this morning we talked about
 
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.330 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning we talked about
another

01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%

interpretation of blood work
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
those individuals were naturopaths
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
should they be part of this
 
01:38:23.699 --> 01:38:24.709 align:start position:0%
should they be part of this
I

01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have a
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other I don't I
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't know uh I'm not intimately
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
familiar with who regulates them and
 
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.810 align:start position:0%
familiar with who regulates them and
whatnot

01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'd I'd defer to others on that
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
one uh thank you for the question by the
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
way representative I defer uh this but
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
would defer on that I think I heard the
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
answer uh there's it's a different board
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
so I think that's that's what I thought
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%

01:39:06.729 --> 01:39:06.739 align:start position:0%
we have had a long-standing tradition
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes not observed under our past
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
chair here
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
that people only get one bite at the
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
Apple and that responses may be made
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
afterwards in any way that people think
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate but
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
only you testify once and then you're
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
done and we don't do a back and forth
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I think it very inadvisable to get
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
into the back and forth because that way
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
even when it's the sponsor of the bill
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
is is unfair to other people all of whom
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
want to also respond so
 
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
I would advise against it but it's up to
 
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.530 align:start position:0%
I would advise against it but it's up to
you

01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
thank you and again
 
01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you and again
um

01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you have a long um
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
tradition and a great deal more
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
experience than I do
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and other there are other people who
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
have signed up to testify so
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I don't know what
 
01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:06.179 align:start position:0%
your schedule is this morning but you're
 
01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:08.219 align:start position:0%
welcome to stay and perhaps at the end
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you're able uh you can address that's
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
concern and perhaps any other concerns
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so any other questions for Mr Cousy
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm seeing none so thank you
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay I also signed up to testify uh is
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Dr Eric Liu from the New Hampshire
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
again I'm here on behalf of the medical
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
society and thank you for having me
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
um if uh we really want to thank
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for heading that
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
committee uh from the last fall uh over
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
looking over the board of medicine's
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process and governing
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
statutes as the committee did find the
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine really
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
needs to seek additional funding through
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
the state's budget project uh process
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
and that more study is really needed to
 
01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
understand if changes are made to the
 
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
board's disciplinary process
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
um we we really thank representative
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
Pearson for all of the hard work that
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
he's done in for introducing HB 322 we
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
also agree with Mr Cousy in that it
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be a good uh process to include
 
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.669 align:start position:0%
would be a good uh process to include
PAs

01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
PAs
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
to provide input into the process and we
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
strongly urge the committee to pass HB
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
322 so we can continue the work that was
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.770 align:start position:0%
322 so we can continue the work that was
started

01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
oh that was great short and sweet
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Paula menahan
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%

Association representing all our
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are in support of three of
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
House Bill 322 and we appreciate all the
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
work that representative Pearson has
 
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:40.100 align:start position:0%
done to date on this um important issue
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
the issues that the study committee
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
shall explore are complex and important
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
to ensure the proper balance of
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
proceedings of the board of Med medicine
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
and safeguarding the safety of patients
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
being treated by physicians this is why
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
we do support this committee and we urge
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
you to pass house bill 322.
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's it oh wow that was quick any
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none so thank you very much
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Shane
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
Goulet from the New Hampshire Board of
 
01:43:19.619 --> 01:43:21.109 align:start position:0%
Goulet from the New Hampshire Board of
Medicine

01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
01:43:30.250 --> 01:43:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Representatives
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
um I'll be short on this one as I think
 
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
that the board again takes no position
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
um the concerns they have are their
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions as far as 9183 were
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
concerned uh outside of that you know
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
it's the primary responsibility of the
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
board of medicine to protect the public
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
they're in favor of transparency within
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
the confines of the legal structure as
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's currently exists with that being
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
said open up for questions
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead representative palazzov
 
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chen thank you for taking
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
my question do you have any position on
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment to replace gnosis
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
with bpas Association oh as far as the
 
01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.209 align:start position:0%
with bpas Association oh as far as the
Pas

01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
Pas
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
um because I don't have a authority to
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the Board of Medicine
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
as it relates to that I the Board of
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
Medicine can't take a position through
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
me I will say that the Board of Medicine
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
does have the authority over Pas
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
um as they you know 329 is currently
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
constructed there is a PA member of the
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine I don't know if that's
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
 
01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:00.770 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
much

01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay no one else has signed up to speak
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson would you like to
 
01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman having thought about it I am
 
01:45:12.609 --> 01:45:12.619 align:start position:0%
going to strenuously object to giving
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor a Last Licks after
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
everybody else is testified it has not
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
been our practice or our custom and I
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
really think it's very unfair to
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
everybody else who testifies on the bill
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I say that with the greatest of
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
respect and also kind friendship for
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson whose remarks are
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
often very helpful
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
see um again I'm I'm new to this job I I
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
have to admit that but at the same time
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Weber it hasn't happened
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
before and it sounds like he has
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
information that might answer some of
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
the questions that were raised and Mr
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
chairman your predecessor was a lot
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
sloppier on this
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
no anyway which doesn't mean it's a good
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
or a bad idea but my new best friend Mr
 
01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:02.219 align:start position:0%
cuzzy and I went out in the hall and
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm going down to
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
OLS and redo the amendments to add the
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
PA Association however not at the
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
expense of the nurses because this is
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
inputting this is not about who we're
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
regulating there's people who are going
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
to show up to help us understand that
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
will not eventually be regulated per se
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
but they have a stake in it okay so
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's all it's new information my new
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
best friend and I have come to a
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
wonderful agreement and I'm going to
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
give you a new amendment when you exact
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
the bill okay so so the mat has been
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
addressed and it sounds like we're well
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay I know no one else signed up to
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
testify uh does anyone in the audience
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
wish to testify who has not uh yet
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%

public hearing on House Bill 322 and

House Bill 299 and in doing so I am

going to recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:31.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:33.169 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you members of
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
the committee for inviting me here to
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
introduce my bill HB 299 for the record
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike Belcher representative
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
from Carroll County District 4 out of
 
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
from Carroll County District 4 out of
Wakefield

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
Wakefield
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
the first thing I would like to say
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to anti-discrimination
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
is that there was nothing removed from
 
01:47:58.450 --> 01:47:58.460 align:start position:0%
current law so all existing
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination stands what I have
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
done is I have sought to add
 
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
certain specific protections that have
 
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
been necessitated by some fairly recent
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
developments within the field of
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
medicine and how it's practiced how it's
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
what you will see here is that there is
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
a new trend in medicine there's various
 
01:48:27.530 --> 01:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
names for it sometimes it can be
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
referred to as Health Equity
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could be referred to as
 
01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.430 align:start position:0%
sometimes it could be referred to as
Justice

01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be referred to as
 
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be referred to as
anti-racism

01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
anti-racism
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and they all kind of they don't
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're not exactly the same definition
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
for each of those words but they have an
 
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
area of overlap that covers what I'm
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
trying to get to in this bill now
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing or rather when a
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider is dealing with a
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
patient they have an individual sitting
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
in front of them it's a person
 
01:49:04.850 --> 01:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's not an avatar of some combination
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
of groups
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's a person with specific needs for
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
their specific health condition at the
 
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
their specific health condition at the
time

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
therefore they should not be treated as
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
merely an avatar of their race or their
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
sex or whatever else now that doesn't
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
mean you can't take these things into
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
consideration because obviously there is
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
importance in the administration of
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
Health Care that a man and a woman are
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
going to have different needs
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
even sometimes people of different races
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
may have different needs depending on
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
the way conditions affect them and
 
01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's all fine there's nothing wrong
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
with that however
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
you will see along the things that I
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
have passed out a very important quote
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
that really gets to the heart of what
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with in some of this new
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
ideological push within Healthcare
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
um Dr Ibrahim X kindy author of the book
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
how to be an anti-racist he's coined the
 
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:02.930 align:start position:0%
how to be an anti-racist he's coined the
term

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
he is the head of the Institute of
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
anti-racism at Boston University they
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
promulgate a lot of this sort of policy
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
his quote says and this this really
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
encapsulate what anti-racism and Health
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
Equity means at its core
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
the only remedy to pass discrimination
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
is present discrimination
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
the only remedy to present
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
um honorable members of the committee I
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
do not think we want to set up a system
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
where we have a Perpetual cycle of
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
punishment and retribution
 
01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
as a part of our system
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
and that is why I have added
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
the specific language in this bill
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
that makes it
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
it prohibits
 
01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.709 align:start position:0%
it prohibits
the

01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:02.450 align:start position:0%
the
consideration

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
of alleged
 
01:51:04.619 --> 01:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
of alleged
historical

01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
injustices that could be very real
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
against any group
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the current
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
administration of Medicine
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
to a real person who is standing in
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
front of a healthcare provider
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what I'm trying to do
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
here I I just I don't want to see this
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination happening and it is it's
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
here it's come here
 
01:51:32.209 --> 01:51:32.219 align:start position:0%
you'll see an article here from the New
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
York Post written by a ex-lutenant
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
governor talking about how these um
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
ideas have been promulgated at the
 
01:51:44.689 --> 01:51:44.699 align:start position:0%
federal level and down
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
you'll see you may note that within this
 
01:51:47.699 --> 01:51:48.790 align:start position:0%
you'll see you may note that within this
state

01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
both the covid vaccinations initially
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
when they were a very rare commodity as
 
01:51:57.709 --> 01:51:57.719 align:start position:0%
well as monoclonal antibodies
 
01:51:57.719 --> 01:51:59.930 align:start position:0%
well as monoclonal antibodies
word

01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
um were rationed in exactly this manner
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it was wholly inappropriate to do so
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
in fact there were civil rights
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
complaints filed with the state because
 
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the way that was handled
 
01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.689 align:start position:0%
of the way that was handled
um

01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for you I'd be happy
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this bill to
 
01:52:23.159 --> 01:52:24.050 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this bill to
us

01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I I recognize that some of this is
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
coming from current events but do you
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
think that if we were able to take this
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
back in time to the Tuskegee experiments
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
if this would have prevented the
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the denial of care of people infected
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
with syphilis in the black community
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
there in order to watch the spread and
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
if that would remedy if this would have
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
been a remedy back then and would
 
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
prevent any future racism in any
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
direction well clearly yes that is that
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
is that is part of what this is designed
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
to prevent now people break the law so
 
01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
would it have actually prevented it if
 
01:52:59.570 --> 01:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
people wanted to do a horrible thing I
 
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
can't be 100 sure but this is designed
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
yes it would in theory at least prevent
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
something like that from happening
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you chairman
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for being here today
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
and taking questions
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
if I a biological male
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
went to a gynecologist and that
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
gynecologist told me to get out of his
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
office or her office would that
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
um would that doctor open themselves up
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
to legal problems because of your
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you
 
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and that is
 
01:53:38.209 --> 01:53:38.219 align:start position:0%
a question that I think is answered in
 
01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
existing statute because the portion of
 
01:53:41.219 --> 01:53:42.109 align:start position:0%
existing statute because the portion of
this

01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
um statute that would address that
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
particular concern is already law
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is not something that has been
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
changed whatsoever so I think the answer
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
is no they would not be opening
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative whoever did you have your
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
I did but I think I'm gonna withdraw
 
01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
that because
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I can ask a question
 
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
and not have a debate so thank you Mr
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
is representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
question representative uh I'm wondering
 
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
how is this going to be enforced
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and an
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
01:54:34.609 --> 01:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
um there is not a specific state
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism however it does
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
create a private cause of action for
 
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
people who have been aggrieved and
 
01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and have been
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's wholly necessary
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
considering the the fact that this is a
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
a well-funded
 
01:54:55.739 --> 01:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
a well-funded
um

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:00.500 align:start position:0%
effort to place this in medicine
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I actually have a
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
question of the chair which is is this
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh Bill going to either
 
01:55:10.609 --> 01:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
um is is this bill going to go to uh the
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee after this or is
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
this just a plain it's my understanding
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
it will only be the one committee bill I
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
from what I understand representative
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other representative
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:32.820 align:start position:0%
um you said that this kind of
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination excuse me this kind of
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination has indeed occurred in
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can you give a more
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
specific details about that yes despite
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
being prescribed I was denied monoclonal
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
antibody treatment
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
it was uh promulgated the guidelines
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
were promulgated at the federal level
 
01:55:55.450 --> 01:55:55.460 align:start position:0%
and pushed down the way that they ranked
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
people in order to receive the scarce
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
resource of monoclonal antibodies for
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
covid-19 infection was by a scoring
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
system in which they they only placed a
 
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:07.729 align:start position:0%
system in which they they only placed a
minor

01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
um emphasis on prehisto a pre-existing
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and other and other
 
01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:17.219 align:start position:0%
truly medical problems but they praised
 
01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that there are any
 
01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
circumstances which under which
 
01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.370 align:start position:0%
circumstances which under which
underserved

01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.189 align:start position:0%
underserved
communities

01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
should be given some kind of priority to
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are served
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
I believe that all communities should
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
have equal access to the system I
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
believe that they should be served
 
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.490 align:start position:0%
believe that they should be served
um

01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
not at the expense of other people but
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
given the same opportunities
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.209 --> 01:57:04.219 align:start position:0%
do you have any documentation that the
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
preferences that were established
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
that included
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
race if that happened because I don't
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
know but I'm taking this on face value
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
were not as a result of past
 
01:57:20.699 --> 01:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
were not as a result of past
discrimination

01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
but as a result of the current medical
 
01:57:26.719 --> 01:57:28.450 align:start position:0%
but as a result of the current medical
evidence

01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:28.460 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
that certain
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
segments of the population
 
01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:38.900 align:start position:0%
experienced higher and far more severe
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
consequences than did other segments of
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
the population can you discount that
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I would I
 
01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
would offer two different tracks on that
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
question which is first because the
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
because the guidelines that were
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
promulgated at the federal level
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
placed I believe a seven times higher
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
emphasis on Race than pre-existing
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
medical conditions I would say that
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
alone is enough to seriously question
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
the premise
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
um also and I I I suspect I could find
 
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
them I believe there was
 
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:18.950 align:start position:0%
them I believe there was
um

01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
press notes from the White House Press
 
01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
Secretary that outlined the reason for
 
01:58:26.209 --> 01:58:26.219 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
the promulgation of these standards to
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
I see a hand up over here yes go ahead
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't have the current RSA
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
that this repeals in front of me I'd
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
can you imagine
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
up a scenario where perhaps let's just
 
01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:56.540 align:start position:0%
say there's a pandemic that
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
disproportionately let's just say
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
hypothetically speaking
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affects men more than
 
01:59:04.729 --> 01:59:04.739 align:start position:0%
women and we've got scarce resources per
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
se and a doctor takes those scarce
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
resources and triages their patients and
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
says hey I want to give this to men not
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
women because men could very well die
 
01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
and the women it's like it's like the
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
sniffles for them so so what they could
 
01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
be doing is taking scarce resources and
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to give it to the group
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
of people whether it's based on you know
 
01:59:28.129 --> 01:59:28.139 align:start position:0%
sex or race or whatever that is you know
 
01:59:31.729 --> 01:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected by some
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
illness and I'm going to give it to them
 
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
even though there's others who are also
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
affected but they're not anywhere near
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
as affected so I don't know to me it
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
just seems like
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
I can imagine in my mind's eye that
 
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
there would be a time where it makes
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
sense to discriminate based on some of
 
01:59:50.689 --> 01:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
these aspects and to have a blanket it
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
never ever under any circumstances could
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually lead to Greater death and
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
suffering have you thought about that
 
01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
and if so what are your thoughts thank
 
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
you yes absolutely and it was wholly my
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
intent to craft a bill that would accept
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
those circumstances where it is the
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
medical evidence before you
 
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
um rather than
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
looking at it looking at an individual
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
rather than as a group Avatar
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
that the individual requires that
 
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
treatment regardless of whether it's
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
linked to sex or race or anything else
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
but they're receiving it because it's
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate care not because of their
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.810 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not really sure how to take your
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony relative to uh the practice of
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
medicine in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh and I say that because my experience
 
02:00:54.169 --> 02:00:54.179 align:start position:0%
is that we do not discriminate based on
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
any of the characteristics that you
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
described here and in fact
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
in general we have oftentimes very
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
limited resources to take care of a
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
large number of people
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
um as a result
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians Pas nurses every health care
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
provider needs to prioritize
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
where their time is spent and what
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
resources they use to take care of
 
02:01:17.099 --> 02:01:18.169 align:start position:0%
resources they use to take care of
patients

02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
in your case you mentioned about not
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
getting antiviral
 
02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps it was because some of the
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations in medical you know
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
environment is if you don't have an
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised host if you're not
 
02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
over the age of 65 if you're otherwise
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
healthy you don't get it and you get the
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
sniffles versus getting you know very
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
sick with some illness like coveted so
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
my question is rather than
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
have this I'm just trying to look for
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
specific examples that you may have
 
02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:48.709 align:start position:0%
specific examples that you may have
where

02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
care that was appropriately prioritized
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
for individuals in the state was not
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
given to them that I would give you as a
 
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
problem but if people in healthcare were
 
02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
providing prioritized resources in their
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
time for patients
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
based on good science evidence-based
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
science then that's not a problem so my
 
02:02:11.689 --> 02:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
question is do you have the data
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
available that says there's a subset of
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
people that met the medical
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications for treatment in the
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but were denied
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
it because of any of these reasons thank
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
you for your question I think I can
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
answer this question on three different
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
levels the first level will be anecdotal
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
in my particular case I do happen to be
 
02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised and I have a
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
significant complicated health history
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
but I was nonetheless refused on the
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
next level would be the guidelines
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
promulgated from the federal government
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
for covid-19 vaccination early on when
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
this was still
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
when there truly were a limited resource
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
there was a significant subset of that
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
put aside just for certain populations
 
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
that was not
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
so it was basically the the whole of the
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
available vaccines were taken and broken
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
into two subsets one would be given out
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
based on need and medical criteria the
 
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
other one was was really just
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
considering race
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
and there were civil rights complaints
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
filed in this state based on that and I
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe it led to the end of that
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
particular process the third way I would
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
answer that question is that this is a
 
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
newer phenomena it's not something
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for decades it's
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
really recently uh only in recent years
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
which brings me to the third handout I
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
gave you uh titled ideological
 
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
intensification which is a study put out
 
02:03:38.089 --> 02:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
by the National Association of Scholars
 
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
which studies the incidence of these
 
02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:44.060 align:start position:0%
particular terms such as equity
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
anti-racism and such and how they have
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
increased in an exponential manner in
 
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
academic literature in stem fields in
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so these these guidelines are newer
 
02:03:57.649 --> 02:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
and they're being promulgated at a very
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none okay thank you thank you
 
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 299.
 
02:04:24.169 --> 02:04:24.179 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 299 and
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
open the house of the public hearing on
 
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 614 and recognize the prime
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.179 --> 02:04:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman McDonald Vice
 
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
chair Leon and honorable did you fill
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
out a pink card representative I did
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's good okay thank you very much sure
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
um my name is Nancy Murphy and I
 
02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsborough County District
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
12 the town of Merrimack I'm happy to be
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
here again to reintroduce
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment was submitted to the
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee at the January 25th public
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
as background for this bill it's
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
important to know that Merrimack is the
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%
site of the largest industrial
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
environmental disaster in the state's
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
history in 2016 our public drinking
 
02:05:40.250 --> 02:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
water was discovered to have been
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pfoa which New Hampshire
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
Des attributed to air emissions from the
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
Sanko Bain performance plastic plant in
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
Merrimack it should be noted that in
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
addition to pfoa there were 190 other
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
pfests also found in Saint Cobain's air
 
02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.370 align:start position:0%
pfests also found in Saint Cobain's air
emissions

02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
my community has the dubious honor of
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
being referred to as New Hampshire's
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
Ground Zero for known widespread
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
long-term and ongoing pfas contamination
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
though scientific research has made us
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
aware of a number of negative human
 
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
health impacts known to be associated
 
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
with environmental exposure to these
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
toxic chemicals and though many of those
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
very same concerning Health outcomes are
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
self-reported by citizens
 
02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%

02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
on January 13 2023 at the behest of
 
02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
citizens and the HB 737 pfas Commission
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
DHHS presented an updated cancer
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
incident report which identified an
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
increase of excess cases of kidney
 
02:06:54.169 --> 02:06:54.179 align:start position:0%
cancer in Merrimack
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
this trend up from 2018 is very
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
concerning to the people of Merrimack
 
02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
and surrounding communities we are
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket for well filtration
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
to protect our drinking water from the
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
dangers of pfas and many believe we are
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
also paying with our health
 
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
according to the National Institute of
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%

02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
genetics higher kidney cancer incidents
 
02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
and mortality have been observed among

Community with contaminated drinking
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
water and now with more cases of kidney
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
cancer than would be expected
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
the DHHS cancer report stated that in
 
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
response to the increase in kidney
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
cancer cases the next appropriate step
 
02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
would be to convey conduct an
 
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
investigation protocol phase 3
 
02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:54.179 align:start position:0%
feasibility study just as it had
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
recommended the DHHS create a repository
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
for data collection relative to adverse
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes known to be associated
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
with pfas exposure
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
the pfas Visa the feasibility study we
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
are discussing today was also supported
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and recommended for legislation and the
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
November 2022 HB 737 pfas commission
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
annual report to the governor HB 16 614
 
02:08:21.490 --> 02:08:21.500 align:start position:0%
as amended has been brought forward
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
after significant collaboration with
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
DHHS and its Passage would provide the
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
department with resources necessary to
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
move forward with this important Health
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
investigation study this work has the
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
potential to benefit not only Merrimack
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
residents but all those living in New
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities where
 
02:08:40.070 --> 02:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Testing has indicated the
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
presence of pfas
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
this study and a full epidemiological
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
study that might follow if determined to
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
be necessary could have positive impacts
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
on early detection cancer prevention and
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for pfas exposed
 
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:55.310 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for pfas exposed
communities

02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study relative to kidney
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
cancers as proposed in this amendment
 
02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
is essentially foundational work for the
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
data collection sought for health
 
02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
outcomes repository and can identify
 
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate cancers and health outcomes
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
for inclusion in a potential phase for
 
02:09:13.729 --> 02:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
epidemiological study
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
so to wrap it up given the statistically
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
significant excess in the number of
 
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
cases of kidney cancer in Merrimack the
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
known exposure of this community to
 
02:09:24.290 --> 02:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants like pfas
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
that have been associated with kidney
 
02:09:26.159 --> 02:09:27.350 align:start position:0%
that have been associated with kidney
cancer

02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
an increase in the number of those
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis over time and the
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation of New Hampshire's DHHS
 
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
that a feasibility study as determined
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire cancer concern
 
02:09:40.129 --> 02:09:40.139 align:start position:0%
investigation protocol phase three be
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
conducted to further investigate this
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
very concerning negative Health outcome
 
02:09:48.530 --> 02:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
HB 614 is amended is meant to authorize
 
02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to fund this cancer
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
investigation protocol as despite its
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
many phenomenal employees DHHS does not
 
02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
have the expertise in-house no the
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
resources to complete the study on its
 
02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:00.649 align:start position:0%
resources to complete the study on its
own

02:10:00.649 --> 02:10:00.659 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
this work would be done through a
 
02:10:04.609 --> 02:10:04.619 align:start position:0%
contract with an academic or research
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
organization and would inform next steps
 
02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the investigation
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
this feasibility study would identify
 
02:10:12.770 --> 02:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate Cancers and health outcomes
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
to be included in an epidemiological
 
02:10:17.089 --> 02:10:17.099 align:start position:0%
study if that is determined to be
 
02:10:19.070 --> 02:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
warranted as well as any other next
 
02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:20.689 align:start position:0%
warranted as well as any other next
steps

02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
steps
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
additionally hb614 is amended will allow
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
DHHS to identify potential exposures
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
that may contribute to this excess of
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer incidence and Aid in
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
understanding how those exposures May
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
contribute to the excess of kidney
 
02:10:36.609 --> 02:10:36.619 align:start position:0%
cancer cases in Merrimack
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
representatives from DHHS who are far
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer specific
 
02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
questions relative to the the
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
feasibility study are here to to do that
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
and provide any further information that
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a community greatly and
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
disproportionately negatively impacted
 
02:10:57.649 --> 02:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
by a life-altering cancer diagnosis one
 
02:10:59.450 --> 02:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
known to be associated with the pfas
 
02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
contamination we have had long-term and
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing exposure to I ask that you
 
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
please vote OTP on HB 614 as amended
 
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention
 
02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative Leon
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative for coming back for this
 
02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:18.589 align:start position:0%
representative for coming back for this
um

02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'll ask some of my questions I
 
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
thought this was a study and not money
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
to design a study but do you know the
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
average amount of time that somebody
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
with with these kidney cancer cases has
 
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
lived in Merrimack versus those that
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
haven't and what that that time of
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
living in Merrimack is
 
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't know
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
and I think that's part of of the
 
02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
purpose of of the feasibility study I do
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
know just anecdotally that kidney cancer
 
02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
has a very long latency period so we've
 
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
we've been probably exposed since the
 
02:11:53.450 --> 02:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
1980s and sometimes it can be many 30
 
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
years you know it depends upon the
 
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
cancer and this is just one cancer
 
02:12:00.050 --> 02:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
that's known to be Associated the only
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
one that's shown up and for the for the
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cancer registry thank you
 
02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that the
 
02:12:17.950 --> 02:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of the amendment
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
is to focus solely on a feasibility
 
02:12:23.219 --> 02:12:24.410 align:start position:0%
is to focus solely on a feasibility
study

02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
at a much smaller expense than a
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
complete epidemiological study
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can determine whether the
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
larger expenditure is in fact
 
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
useful and helpful or unnecessary and
 
02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:40.370 align:start position:0%
useful and helpful or unnecessary and
wasteful

02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
wasteful
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your question exactly
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
um it the uh a phase four study is much
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
more extensive and much more expensive
 
02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.330 align:start position:0%
more extensive and much more expensive
and

02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:51.649 --> 02:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
um Federal funding is sometimes
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
available for those things but this part
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
has to be done first so it's a first
 
02:13:00.609 --> 02:13:00.619 align:start position:0%
step and and it is the focus is smaller
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
based on the actual data that we have we
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
probably think there are a number of
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
um that we're experienced in the
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
community but this is the one we
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you chairman
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you for taking questions
 
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'd never heard of pfas before just like
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
and now it seems like everybody's
 
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
talking about it is there any way that
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
we can I'm sure that New Hampshire would
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
not be the only state that would be
 
02:13:31.609 --> 02:13:31.619 align:start position:0%
doing these kinds of studies is there
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
any way we could just save us a bunch of
 
02:13:35.089 --> 02:13:35.099 align:start position:0%
money and piggyback off some other state
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
that does this or is there something
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
that's strictly specific for New
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information that we just can't
 
02:13:43.609 --> 02:13:43.619 align:start position:0%
get from anywhere else thank you sure
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I would probably defer to DHHS to
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
answer the specifics about the
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
feasibility study it's itself but I
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
would imagine that because it's specific
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
to a complete Community Based on the
 
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
exposure that we've had our community is
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
about 33 miles square miles I think and
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
the exposure is about 65 square miles so
 
02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
we have had the the abundance of the
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
concentrated exposure through air our
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
water and our soil so I don't know if
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
another area in the country would have
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
similar exposures we we have more than
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
your average pfas exposure
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.189 --> 02:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions

testified the last time but she's an
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
exact session and she gave me some
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
testimony she asked if I could read it
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
into the record or should I just hand it
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%

provide a copy to the committee as well
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
it is the position of the department
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the proposed amendment is more
 
02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
aligned with the Department's
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations regarding next steps in
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
exploring potential exposures that could
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
have contributed to excess number of
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer cases observed in

Merrimack
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the department has worked in
 
02:17:25.730 --> 02:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
collaboration with representative Murphy
 
02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
regarding the proposed amendment which
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
would provide necessary funds to support
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
the Department's recommendation to to
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
move to phase three in accordance with
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire cancer concern
 
02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
investigation protocol which does
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
include conducting a feasibility study
 
02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:44.099 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study would be completed
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
through a contract with an academic or
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
research organization and would inform
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
next steps in the investigation
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
the goal of the feasibility study is to
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
gather additional information to help
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
determine what an epidemiological study
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry weather and epidemiological
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
study is warranted and would also
 
02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
identify the appropriate Cancers and
 
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
health outcomes for inclusion in such a
 
02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
health outcomes for inclusion in such a
study

02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
the state cancer registry does not
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
include important information about
 
02:18:14.889 --> 02:18:14.899 align:start position:0%
residential history
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
environmental exposures and kidney
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
cancer related risk factors such as
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
smoking a scientific literature review
 
02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
which is one step in the feasibility
 
02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
study would provide a better
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
understanding of the risk factors and
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
environmental exposures associated with
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
in addition the study would identify
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
relevant data and determine the
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
plausibility that cases and contaminants
 
02:18:43.129 --> 02:18:43.139 align:start position:0%
could potentially be Associated through
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
review of known contaminants and
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
potential exposure Pathways review of
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
historical records and Gathering of
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
residential occupational and exposure
 
02:18:53.519 --> 02:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
residential occupational and exposure
histories

02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
histories
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
the study would also evaluate the
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
willingness and the ability of
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
identified cases to participate in this
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
data Gathering phase and would gather
 
02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:07.139 align:start position:0%
input from community members about what
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
they need and want with regard to the
 
02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
investigation and set expectations
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
around the process and potential
 
02:19:14.399 --> 02:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
around the process and potential
outcomes

02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
the feasibility I'm sorry the
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
feasibility study would also include
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
developing a study hypothesis and
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
protocol obtain approval from an
 
02:19:27.049 --> 02:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
Institutional review board to implement
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
the study analyze the data develop a
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
report and share the study results and
 
02:19:32.099 --> 02:19:33.230 align:start position:0%
report and share the study results and
findings

02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
findings
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
the results of the feasibility study
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
will inform next steps in the
 
02:19:39.549 --> 02:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
investigation including whether an
 
02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:42.599 align:start position:0%
epidemiological or phase four for study
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
is warranted and if such study could be
 
02:19:45.359 --> 02:19:47.509 align:start position:0%
is warranted and if such study could be
funded

02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
the proposed 500 000 appropriation to be
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
provided to the New Hampshire Department
 
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services would
 
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
support this study
 
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today and we
 
02:19:59.810 --> 02:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
that you may have
 
02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
being here this is definitely a
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
complicated topic and I'm so glad to
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
have your expertise if I could ask a
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
couple questions within there the first
 
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
is regarding the funding have you
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
pursued any federal grants or looking at
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
the possibility of one of these
 
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
institutions charging a post-doc with
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
this in order to look into this in order
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
to build their own research as part of
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
their current academic path as opposed
 
02:20:34.250 --> 02:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
to a taxpayer expense
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
and yes I'll follow up after that
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
no we have not uh pursued any federal
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
funding for this um this was a
 
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh Murphy came to us and
 
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
talked about sort of next steps so
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where we are we just
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
delivered uh the report on January 13th
 
02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I would add in so we do work closely
 
02:21:05.929 --> 02:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh The Entity that actually operates our
 
02:21:07.849 --> 02:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cancer registry is
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and we do have a close
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
relationship with them in terms of you
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
know trying to explore opportunities to
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
collaborate on Federal grant
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
applications the feedback typically from
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
them has been that they need what they
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
call preliminary data or the data that
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to collect through or that
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
is proposed to be collected through this
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
feasibility study to actually submit a
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
fundable application for research
 
02:21:36.170 --> 02:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you um and for follow-up
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
um it sounded like there was no
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
residency information was there any
 
02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
information collected on how long these
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
people that have these incidents of
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer have lived in Merrimack or
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
is that just that they're currently a
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
resident of Merrimack so the cancer
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
registry we follow the guidelines that
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
CDC gives us in terms of the data and
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
how it's collected and that is done
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
um in so it's based on the time at
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so that we don't get any
 
02:22:05.210 --> 02:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
residential history and in fact people
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
could live elsewhere when they're
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and we wouldn't we wouldn't
 
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
get that information either so it's only
 
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
the time it diagnosis with kidney cancer
 
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's captured
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay and then as my last follow-up do
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
you expect that this will be completed
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
within two years or will this need to go
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
into the following biennial budget
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
I would expect it could be completed
 
02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
within two years
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cannon
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
along the same line uh question have you
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
approached unh
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's an organization that might be
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
interested in in doing a lot of this
 
02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:46.969 align:start position:0%
interested in in doing a lot of this
work

02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
so I've served on the hb7 37 since its
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
Inception and one of the members of that
 
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
commission is Amy Costello from UNH
 
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health policy and practice
 
02:22:56.809 --> 02:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
so they too are an active member in this
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
area of research but I think they would
 
02:23:00.290 --> 02:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
share similar sentiments to Dartmouth
 
02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
that preliminary data is really
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to write a
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
see no other questions representative
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
land thank you for letting me triple dip
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
here my other question is what kind of
 
02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
actual study do you intend to fund
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
within this is there actually going to
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
be a collection of data or is this just
 
02:23:27.050 --> 02:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
designing a study in order to put in
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
that Grant application either to the
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
state or to another body
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
so this would involve designing a study
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
to collect additional data from
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who and again the case
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
definition would be part of what this
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
entity would figure out but it would be
 
02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
at least inclusive of people who were
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
residents in Merrimack at the time they
 
02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
were diagnosed with kidney cancer and
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
the data Gathering that would be funded
 
02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
through this would include information
 
02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:56.060 align:start position:0%
about things like residential history
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
things like once the literature review
 
02:24:00.650 --> 02:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
was complete and we had an understanding
 
02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
of all the different known risk factors
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
for kidney cancer we would be capturing
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
that sort of you know information as
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
well so things like smoking history and
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
then that all would ultimately be used
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
to develop some kind of a potential
 
02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
study hypothesis and you know inform a
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
sorry and my one last question is do you
 
02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
expect that this will be designed so
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
that there may be a signal that says
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
that there's no information here to be
 
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
found and we've terminated this at this
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
point without going on to phase four
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's the potential for
 
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.770 align:start position:0%
yes I think there's the potential for
that

02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
is that defined
 
02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
can you say that again is that defined
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
within the program or just a a
 
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:45.969 align:start position:0%
within the program or just a a
possibility

02:24:45.969 --> 02:24:45.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll follow it the protocol allows
 
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
for that to be a decision at the end of
 
02:24:53.809 --> 02:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
phase three of a feasibility study that
 
02:24:56.450 --> 02:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
we may not be able to gather enough data
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
to detect a statistically significant
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
relationship but I would like to make
 
02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
the point that that doesn't mean that
 
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
there's not risk factors in the region
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
that may be contributing to excess
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer simply because we can't
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
detect a signal
 
02:25:12.170 --> 02:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
um I hope that answers your question it
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.650 --> 02:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
and taking my question
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering how familiar your
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
department is with uh the Biden
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
administration's plan that was recently
 
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
launched to combat pfas pollution and to
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
study the problem I'm seeing 15 million
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
dollars being put into this program and
 
02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
is this premature in doing this
 
02:25:42.770 --> 02:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
feasibility study until that program has
 
02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
been implemented and releases some
 
02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
conclusions and we know the scope of it
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to be enacted in the
 
02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:55.510 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to be enacted in the
state

02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
I would say that the scientific field of
 
02:26:00.410 --> 02:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
pfas and health effects is an evolving
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
field and so the work done here in
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
Merrimack will contribute to any
 
02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
national work being done I don't think
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's premature to do this and we work
 
02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
closely with Partners at CDC and atsdr
 
02:26:12.050 --> 02:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
probably the entities who would be
 
02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
pursuing this work under the Biden
 
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
Administration so I think that this work
 
02:26:17.929 --> 02:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
would be collaborative and supportive of
 
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
any other National initiatives
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I would actually add in that part of
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
the goal of this phase is to come up
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
with a study hypothesis and again
 
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
knowing that kidney cancer has other
 
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
known risk factors we're not necessarily
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
at a place where we are testing a
 
02:26:37.969 --> 02:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
hypothesis between pfas and kidney
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
cancer so this might actually set us up
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
to be in a better place when funding
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
specific to pfas becomes available from
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.479 --> 02:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:52.610 --> 02:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
Nick signed up to speak is Dr Michael
 
02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:12.469 align:start position:0%
Nick signed up to speak is Dr Michael
Leon

02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.309 --> 02:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
Tom thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee full disclosure I am related
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
by marriage to uh the vice chairman of
 
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
this committee so you've probably
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
already told you you have three minutes
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
right yes I usually have less at home
 
02:27:30.479 --> 02:27:31.550 align:start position:0%
right yes I usually have less at home
um

02:27:31.550 --> 02:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
so briefly
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
um my background I'm 52 I've been
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
involved with biomedical research since
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
I've been 17 years old I've focused most
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
of my life on oncology or cancer
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
research solid cancer including kidney
 
02:27:46.130 --> 02:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
cancer as well as benign and malignant
 
02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
cancer as well as benign and malignant
hematology

02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
hematology
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
I had the honor of doing my training at
 
02:27:52.969 --> 02:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
doctoral training at Dartmouth since
 
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
then I've worked for companies both
 
02:27:56.809 --> 02:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
large and small I've been involved in
 
02:27:59.690 --> 02:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
biomedical research from very rare
 
02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
diseases where the number of subjects is
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
under 100 significantly under 100 to
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
those in the several thousand
 
02:28:10.010 --> 02:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
in designing a study
 
02:28:12.889 --> 02:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
the thought of five hundred thousand
 
02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
dollar price tag if this happened in
 
02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:15.889 align:start position:0%
dollar price tag if this happened in
industry

02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
there better be an Ethics investigation
 
02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
by the office of the Inspector General
 
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely an absurd amount of
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
money to design a study not to conduct a
 
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
study one of the more recent studies
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
that I designed at the NIH is actually
 
02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
funding the total cost for operating the
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
study was a hundred and fifty thousand
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars there are studies that cost
 
02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that is true but to
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
go on a fishing expedition in a very
 
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
very small focused area with the
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
assumption that you're going to find
 
02:28:45.889 --> 02:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
something related to pfas and kidney
 
02:28:47.929 --> 02:28:47.939 align:start position:0%
cancer you need to look at the state
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
data there's less than 300 cases on
 
02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
average in New Hampshire of kidney
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
cancer we are below the national average
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
we are increasing ever so slightly
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
if you look at Merrimack yes one year
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's spiked up to attribute that to pfas
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
you need to have solid data over several
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
years The Five-Year moving average is
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
not showing that in fact only two
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
counties neither of which are mentioned
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
are increasing in New Hampshire
 
02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
I highly encourage this study to be
 
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
pursued this can be done by Academia to
 
02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
pursue either registry or come up with a
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
study design and come back and there are
 
02:29:25.730 --> 02:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
certainly funding if one looks on the
 
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
CDC website today the NIH to fund such a
 
02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:31.010 align:start position:0%
CDC website today the NIH to fund such a
study

02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:44.280 align:start position:0%

02:29:58.250 --> 02:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
environmental and health effects of pfas
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
how'd I do with the name
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
oh wow
 
02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:04.429 align:start position:0%
oh wow
okay

push the button for the microphone
please

02:30:06.889 --> 02:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee better better thank you all
 
02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:11.090 align:start position:0%
committee better better thank you all
um

02:30:11.090 --> 02:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
my perspective is somewhat unique but
 
02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
I've been a member of the HB 737
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
commission for the last three years and
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the new chair and I've been the
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the environmental subcommittee
 
02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
for all three years that we have issued
 
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
reports and I do thank representative
 
02:30:28.610 --> 02:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
Murphy and the other sponsors of this
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill for bringing this matter forward
 
02:30:35.929 --> 02:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
my own involvement began long before the
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
HB 737 commission is a member of a
 
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
governing body in the neighboring town
 
02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
of Bedford that is served by part of it
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
served by MVD Wells that had a high
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
level of contamination for the area of
 
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
Bedford that is served by MVD as well as
 
02:30:56.290 --> 02:30:56.300 align:start position:0%
the Upland area of Merrimack that being
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
Wells four and five that were taken
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
offline uh very quickly in 2016 but at
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
that time those Wells had a very high
 
02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:06.710 align:start position:0%
that time those Wells had a very high
level

02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
of pfas contamination and probably did
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
for a very long period into into the
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
past and so Merrimack which is
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
predominantly served by uh public water
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
presents a very good opportunity for
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
academic study and research and the
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal not to lose sight of it is
 
02:31:29.929 --> 02:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
proper screening of patients early
 
02:31:33.170 --> 02:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
identification of potential cancers And
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
Timely treatment of patients and that
 
02:31:38.210 --> 02:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
benefits Public Health not just in
 
02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
Merrimack but all over the state where
 
02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination sites exist from near
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
the Canadian border in Pittsburgh down
 
02:31:49.969 --> 02:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
to Swansea and all the way out to
 
02:31:52.429 --> 02:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hampton so it's a problem that exists
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
across the state there is probably no
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
better system to study than the
 
02:32:01.849 --> 02:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
Merrimack system because of that local
 
02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
contamination and concentration in Wells
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
four and five
 
02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
with those Wells being brought offline
 
02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:12.110 align:start position:0%
in 2016
um

02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:17.330 --> 02:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
population as you know disperses and uh
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
other risk factors intrude and so as
 
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
time goes by the quality of data
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
degrades and
 
02:32:29.389 --> 02:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
um this is something that is a timely
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
piece of research and it should be
 
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
pursued in my opinion as well as the
 
02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
opinions of my colleagues on the HB 737
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission as I stated earlier this
 
02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
journey became began a long time ago
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
when it came to light to the public in
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
2016. the governor in August of 2018
 
02:32:53.050 --> 02:32:53.060 align:start position:0%
convened a round table
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
meeting with agency Commissioners and
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
agency staff as well as people like
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
myself who are representing the
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
governing bodies of the affected towns
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I was very pleased to learn at that
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
time that state epidemiologist Dr Chan
 
02:33:12.770 --> 02:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
had requested a health consultation from
 
02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
the CDC already in June of 2016. so only
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
four months after this came to light and
 
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
so uh and I quickly received an
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
education on some of some of the issues
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
that have been raised here which is why
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't this be done from an academic
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
research institution with NIH funding
 
02:33:35.570 --> 02:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps and that goes back to my roots
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
in a different occupation at a different
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
time but I quickly learned about the
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
limitations that are available
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of getting research done in the
 
02:33:45.969 --> 02:33:45.979 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:33:51.410 --> 02:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
that phase two I was completed and I
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm taking up too much time
 
02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm taking up too much time
uh

02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you could start wrapping up please
 
02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:01.460 align:start position:0%
okay uh phase two that was presented by
 
02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
DHHS staff uh to the Commission in
 
02:34:07.130 --> 02:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
January I would say was a very
 
02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
um well-conceived well-executed
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
well-presented study we are very well
 
02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
served by our DHHS staff and scientists
 
02:34:18.889 --> 02:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
I feel privileged and proud to work with
 
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
them every single month that the
 
02:34:23.090 --> 02:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
commission has been in session in the
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire should be as
 
02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:26.690 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire should be as
well

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:30.110 --> 02:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
this is the next bridge to the ultimate
 
02:34:33.050 --> 02:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
objective of being able to screen
 
02:34:35.090 --> 02:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire properly
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
early diagnosed cancers or rule out
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that should be ruled out and
 
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
ultimately with the objective of
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
improving public health and reducing
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
mortality so the commissioner fully
 
02:34:54.410 --> 02:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
supports this effort and would ask for
 
02:34:59.330 --> 02:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
any questions I see no questions okay
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
I have no other uh I have no one else

and um we have the prime sponsor here
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson somebody we
 
04:05:28.250 --> 04:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
have seen once or twice already today
 
04:05:30.650 --> 04:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's you Mr representative
 
04:05:35.210 --> 04:05:35.220 align:start position:0%

04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
in advance that this is only one page
 
04:06:26.760 --> 04:06:28.429 align:start position:0%
in advance that this is only one page
long

04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
late uh last term the late and much
 
04:06:33.050 --> 04:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
beloved representative Catherine Rogers
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
submitted proposed legislation under
 
04:06:38.050 --> 04:06:38.060 align:start position:0%
Bill number HB 1290 entitled
 
04:06:40.610 --> 04:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
establishing a task force on Precision
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
medicine and biomarker testing it was
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
assigned to this committee then
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
Committee Member Dr Jeffrey soloway
 
04:06:51.170 --> 04:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
suggested we vote the bill interim study
 
04:06:54.170 --> 04:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
and that the chairman of DHHS oversight
 
04:06:56.570 --> 04:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
would appoint a special subcommittee to
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
work on the bill immediately this
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee voted interim study 20-0 and I
 
04:07:04.370 --> 04:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
as chairman of oversight appointed
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Solway as chairman of
 
04:07:08.689 --> 04:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
that special subcommittee the
 
04:07:10.490 --> 04:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee made its report back to
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
oversight and several of us prepared the
 
04:07:17.050 --> 04:07:17.060 align:start position:0%
bill that you have before us the concern
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
regarding emerging medical Technologies
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
is twofold first the state must assess
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
its role in facilitating new
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
preventative and Curative Technologies
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
secondly the state must provide
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
oversight to determine where something
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
new may prove to be harmful
 
04:07:40.130 --> 04:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a committee to
 
04:07:42.110 --> 04:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
keep abreast of such emerging
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies and facilitate them when
 
04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
warranted and sound an alarm when
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessary you will notice not
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
surprisingly the language similar to the
 
04:07:54.410 --> 04:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
bill on the Board of Medicine which I
 
04:07:56.750 --> 04:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
will not discuss you heard in committee
 
04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
this morning specifically in these ways
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
naming of alternative members who can
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
step in when needed during hearings
 
04:08:06.110 --> 04:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
while their presence we hope at every
 
04:08:08.150 --> 04:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
meeting will augment the wisdom of the
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
regular members their absence will not
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
work against the necessary quota for
 
04:08:12.660 --> 04:08:13.610 align:start position:0%
work against the necessary quota for
voting

04:08:13.610 --> 04:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
voting
 
04:08:15.769 --> 04:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
secondly because of a Bill signed into
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
law last year mandating a majority of
 
04:08:19.969 --> 04:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
voting members of a study committee be
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
legislators yet acknowledging how
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
important the regular presence of
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is to the work of the
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee provision is made in the bill
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
to ask various organizations to send
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
individuals as regular participants and
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
not the occasional Observers three there
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
is a sunset provision of October 1st
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
2028 with the house now having a special
 
04:08:46.130 --> 04:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
committee on committees perhaps to weed
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
out unnecessary and dormant ones Sunset
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
Provisions may be wise and they are
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly popular if a
 
04:08:55.849 --> 04:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
committee has done its work it needs to
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
disappear if not it can be reauthorized
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
these three items may become the new
 
04:09:03.050 --> 04:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
normal in crafting bills establishing
 
04:09:05.450 --> 04:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
committees and I end by saying thank you
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
to representative Rogers first of all
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
for her life work here but secondly on
 
04:09:13.130 --> 04:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
this specific issue and thank you to
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative soloway for walking this
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
through a subcommittee to write the bill
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
04:09:27.540 --> 04:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
yes

04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for taking my
 
04:09:34.130 --> 04:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:09:37.309 --> 04:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
um the this new committee
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
is is its intention to be studying
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies and and to
 
04:09:47.689 --> 04:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
do what with that information exactly
 
04:09:47.699 --> 04:09:49.250 align:start position:0%
do what with that information exactly
to

04:09:49.250 --> 04:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
be in regular touch with Scientists with
 
04:09:56.650 --> 04:09:56.660 align:start position:0%
medical leaders in the state
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
this will be a a forum whereby those
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
people can be brought together to study
 
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
what is considered emerging medical
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
Technologies and then to make
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
so would part of the purpose of this
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee be to recommend any enabling
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
legislation that might be necessary
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
in light of emerging Technologies
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily fit into our current
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme to make sure that we
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
are keeping abreast just as we have done
 
04:10:46.090 --> 04:10:46.100 align:start position:0%
for example in the issue of Telehealth
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
that new technologies are not only being
 
04:10:52.570 --> 04:10:52.580 align:start position:0%
used appropriately being promoted
 
04:10:56.050 --> 04:10:56.060 align:start position:0%
appropriately when whence that's due
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
I would say yes that is correct this is
 
04:11:01.370 --> 04:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
not to say that any medical schools in
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
New England aren't doing this or any
 
04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
other groups aren't doing this this just
 
04:11:10.150 --> 04:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
makes sure that there is a group
 
04:11:13.969 --> 04:11:13.979 align:start position:0%
in part of legislators so that that
 
04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
connection between science and
 
04:11:20.809 --> 04:11:20.819 align:start position:0%
legislation will be in place
 
04:11:23.090 --> 04:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for taking my
 
04:11:27.359 --> 04:11:28.189 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for taking my
question

04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:11:28.199 --> 04:11:30.590 align:start position:0%
question
historically

04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
historically
 
04:11:32.689 --> 04:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies have a tendency to be
 
04:11:32.699 --> 04:11:33.889 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies have a tendency to be
reactionary

04:11:33.889 --> 04:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
reactionary
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
and we try to catch up with what's going
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
on in the market
 
04:11:40.130 --> 04:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as a way to be more
 
04:11:40.140 --> 04:11:41.330 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as a way to be more
proactive

04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
04:11:43.729 --> 04:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
to have people coming to the legislative
 
04:11:43.739 --> 04:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
to have people coming to the legislative
body

04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
to follow representative Weber said to
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
be able to enable legislation to take
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
care of what's emerging is that a fair
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
statement or should I say would you
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe well I was ready to say I do
 
04:11:59.809 --> 04:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
believe that even before that but yeah
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that is a fair statement thank you
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:12:06.239 --> 04:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
Pearson

04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I have a little bit of past
 
04:12:12.170 --> 04:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
experience in this area I'm curious if
 
04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
you would be looking for this commission
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
to this committee to look early in the
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
pre-clinical development when it's
 
04:12:19.370 --> 04:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
starting to move out of the lab into
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
human when it's moving around to after
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
the FDA approval process after that
 
04:12:26.450 --> 04:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
prior to reimbursement or after the
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement scheme is there I know
 
04:12:29.330 --> 04:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
there's a large spectrum and I'm curious
 
04:12:31.370 --> 04:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
where the focus would be it will be
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
curious to see how it plays out as they
 
04:12:35.090 --> 04:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
come together what they see their
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
initial focus and the number of focal
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
points would become
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.010 --> 04:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:12:49.490 --> 04:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:12:49.500 --> 04:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
Pearson

04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
04:12:51.120 --> 04:12:52.370 align:start position:0%
Pearson
um

04:12:52.370 --> 04:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:54.889 --> 04:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'm struck by
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
something I tried to understand better
 
04:12:58.849 --> 04:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
last night specifically what was the
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
definition of an emerging technology and
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
the reason why I asked the question has
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
to do with um
 
04:13:07.330 --> 04:13:07.340 align:start position:0%
line 21 of the bill when it talks
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
examining the barriers the reason why I
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
was thinking this is we heard about
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
naturopathy earlier today
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
I can think of a lot of very old
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
modalities that are frankly totally
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
lacking at evidence-based that over time
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're seeing evidence-based develop that
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
may say that yes there is uses that are
 
04:13:28.729 --> 04:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
reasonable and should be paid for
 
04:13:28.739 --> 04:13:29.929 align:start position:0%
reasonable and should be paid for
whatever

04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:13:33.290 --> 04:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
do you see this at all in looking at Old
 
04:13:35.630 --> 04:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
modalities that don't have evidence that
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
now do or constantly re-examining the
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
evidence based on those things once
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
again I think the scope will be
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
determined by the group that's put
 
04:13:47.769 --> 04:13:47.779 align:start position:0%
together while the initial
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
attention was given to new things I
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily say that this new
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
group would not look at old things that
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps have not gained wider acceptance
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that to them
 
04:14:04.560 --> 04:14:09.969 align:start position:0%
but I'll leave that to them
okay

04:14:09.969 --> 04:14:09.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's an unrelated question
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
am I okay to ask it okay
 
04:14:16.020 --> 04:14:16.849 align:start position:0%
am I okay to ask it okay
um

04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
I'm curious also we're fortunate to have
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
an expert on stem cell therapies here
 
04:14:24.530 --> 04:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
um stem cell therapies
 
04:14:27.290 --> 04:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
um have potential Great Value they also
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
have a fair amount of charlatanism too
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
do you see this group as a way of
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
consumer advocacy protecting people from
 
04:14:37.010 --> 04:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
the Charlton charlatanism aspect of
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
those things
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
this is a question that came up
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday at children and family law in
 
04:14:43.370 --> 04:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
a different way
 
04:14:44.929 --> 04:14:44.939 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people out there
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of gurus with gimmicks
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
as well as Dr snow at the pump handle in
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
SoHo who alone
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
found out where cholera came from so
 
04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
just because it's new just because it's
 
04:15:01.010 --> 04:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
unpopular doesn't mean it's wrong but
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
just because it's new and it's in the
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
news doesn't mean it's right I would say
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
that yes I hope that there would be a
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
judicious cautioning to the public of
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
something that is gaining some traction
 
04:15:17.090 --> 04:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:15:19.199 --> 04:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
04:15:27.050 --> 04:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering as I was reading
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
this I'm thinking
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
should a bill like this in a committee
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
of this nature which is obviously look
 
04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
into the future for a lot of stuff
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
should we even Sundown it in the first
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
place should we what Sundown and should
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
we uh repeal it
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
um October of 28. I'm just I was
 
04:15:45.790 --> 04:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
just we will have emerging Technologies
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
going forward indefinitely in
 
04:15:53.330 --> 04:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
um do we need to repeal it or would we
 
04:15:54.830 --> 04:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
want to just basically leave it
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
open-ended I didn't write the bill but I
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
can sniff the wind and right now there's
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
a kill attitude towards lots of
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
commissions that have not met so to
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
placate anyone and each and several uh
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
when this language was given to me
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I didn't try to strike it out if it's
 
04:16:18.910 --> 04:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
doing a good job it can be re-upped
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree with that I was just
 
04:16:23.150 --> 04:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
the previous ones that we did sun down I
 
04:16:24.290 --> 04:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
understood because they have a time
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
limit to it to me my opinion would be
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
that this may be an ongoing you know
 
04:16:31.250 --> 04:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
evolutionary type of committee as time
 
04:16:33.290 --> 04:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
goes by it was mostly a thought not a
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
criticism of the bill obviously well in
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
2018 2028 for my position as chairman of
 
04:16:39.769 --> 04:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game I may be back to ask for a
 
04:16:39.779 --> 04:16:43.070 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game I may be back to ask for a
re-up

04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative land
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:16:48.479 --> 04:16:50.030 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:16:50.030 --> 04:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:53.210 --> 04:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the um basically the
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
advisory members of this the there all
 
04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be appointed members of the
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
medical society pharmacists Association
 
04:17:06.530 --> 04:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
um Etc and I'm sure there will be you
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
know general public uh opportunity for
 
04:17:12.410 --> 04:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
the general public to come and speak but
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I'm just concerned if we're we're
 
04:17:17.689 --> 04:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at
 
04:17:17.699 --> 04:17:18.410 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at
um

04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know how do I say this okay
 
04:17:24.290 --> 04:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
um concern that all of these
 
04:17:27.050 --> 04:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
organizations are kind of gonna have a
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
similar Viewpoint and maybe just the
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
um a registered nurse period or a
 
04:17:36.050 --> 04:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
registered nurse not a member of the New
 
04:17:38.150 --> 04:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nurses Association you see
 
04:17:39.769 --> 04:17:39.779 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying like it would be nice to
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
get a Viewpoint from a professional who
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
may not be a part of these professional
 
04:17:45.769 --> 04:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
organizations and therefore may have a
 
04:17:45.779 --> 04:17:46.510 align:start position:0%
organizations and therefore may have a
different

04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is coming out
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
I would agree and given what we passed
 
04:17:56.889 --> 04:17:56.899 align:start position:0%
and the governor signed Last Summer
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
the only members are the legislative
 
04:18:01.370 --> 04:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
members and these others are people we
 
04:18:03.050 --> 04:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
would really like to see on a regular
 
04:18:06.170 --> 04:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
basis I saw that language as inclusive
 
04:18:08.450 --> 04:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
not exclusive that if anybody wants to
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
show up including but not limited to
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
physician assistance they have a right
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
to send somebody and a nurse who is not
 
04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
appointed by the nursing association can
 
04:18:21.610 --> 04:18:21.620 align:start position:0%
show up what I would encourage is
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
regularity if you're going to be part of
 
04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
the process we need they they I'm not
 
04:18:27.410 --> 04:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to be on this but they would need
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
to see such a person or such persons
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
regularly so
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to see the lone voice
 
04:18:38.809 --> 04:18:38.819 align:start position:0%
crying Against The Establishment if that
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
person comes prepared and comes
 
04:18:40.920 --> 04:18:44.570 align:start position:0%
person comes prepared and comes
regularly

04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.050 --> 04:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
um what would your opinion be to include
 
04:18:49.729 --> 04:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
um patient advocacy organizations in New
 
04:18:53.330 --> 04:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like Health Freedom New
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and appointee from their
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
organization as well if the committee
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
concludes that broadening the list of
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
those specified to be invited
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um fine I do not believe that the author
 
04:19:11.330 --> 04:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:19:11.340 --> 04:19:11.929 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:13.610 --> 04:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
and I certainly don't believe myself
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
this would be a bad thing
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
um Bring It On thank you
 
04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon
 
04:19:24.410 --> 04:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly we we uncovered
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
that there were numerous conferences on
 
04:19:33.290 --> 04:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
this topic all by itself as far as the
 
04:19:36.410 --> 04:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
variety of medical opportunities there
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
were and I and I
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where a lot of we
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
uncovered the number of people that we
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
would include would would be from
 
04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
different perspectives that might have
 
04:19:50.450 --> 04:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
some input from those conferences and
 
04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
information is that correct
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
04:20:00.960 --> 04:20:01.910 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you again representative
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
Pearson for taking the question
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
in I do concur with what representative
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
Murphy was saying in regards to
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
sunsetting this
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
instead of it being decided by the
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body since it's part of the
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of DHHS
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate place to make the
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
determination whether to extend it or
 
04:20:22.920 --> 04:20:24.110 align:start position:0%
determination whether to extend it or
not

04:20:24.110 --> 04:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:20:27.530 --> 04:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
be there in a legislative body
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
can't do it that way
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
I would be happy however this came into
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
being and if this committee wishes to
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
send it over to oversight again that's
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
where this it started here went over to
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
oversight has come back here and if we
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
want to do this for a while we can do
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
that and I wouldn't mind overseeing it
 
04:20:48.290 --> 04:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
since I'd share that body
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to you folks wherever it best
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
lands is good with me
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:20:56.150 --> 04:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
Pearson we've spoken to some of the
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
opportunities but you also spoke to
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
identifying risk when I was on Wall
 
04:21:03.769 --> 04:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
Street we dealt with the late strength
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
thrombosis people were getting blood
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
clots after they got this great new
 
04:21:08.689 --> 04:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
technology and it wasn't saving lives
 
04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
what do how do you see the role of this
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee evaluating new emerging
 
04:21:17.450 --> 04:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
threats possibly ahead of the FDA and do
 
04:21:19.010 --> 04:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
you think that this would have any role
 
04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
in people's concerns over the coveted
 
04:21:22.610 --> 04:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
vaccine and potential harm and increased
 
04:21:24.290 --> 04:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
various cases
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
I hope that they would follow the
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
research that is being done various
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
places follow the literature but also to
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
the degree that they are able and
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
willing to do it Blaze the trail
 
04:21:36.239 --> 04:21:37.550 align:start position:0%
willing to do it Blaze the trail
themselves

04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:21:40.849 --> 04:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
so I would like them to be part of the
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
process but perhaps on some occasions
 
04:21:45.530 --> 04:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
even lead the process
 
04:21:47.210 --> 04:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and just if I can have one
 
04:21:49.610 --> 04:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
other follow-up with my experience I
 
04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
worked with some of the cell and tissue
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
regeneration that was just in in
 
04:21:55.250 --> 04:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
Academia before and now is in Manchester
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
at army I was curious because that is
 
04:22:00.170 --> 04:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
truly emerging Technologies and growing
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
organs I was wondering if that has any
 
04:22:06.410 --> 04:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible to ask
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers that question but
 
04:22:14.990 --> 04:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
those of you who know her very well may
 
04:22:17.689 --> 04:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
have had a conversation with her about
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
this this bill was presented I remember
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
when she did it before us and I don't
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
remember that maybe some of you who were
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
there might so I don't know it's
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
expanded greatly since then yeah that
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
was that was biomarkers so there's been
 
04:22:36.050 --> 04:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
no conversation with army about the
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
benefits for that
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge thank you but
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
remember I'm the liberal arts kid I
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't know these things
 
04:22:47.330 --> 04:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman if I may I have my
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
one-page testimony sure everyone sure
 
04:23:03.969 --> 04:23:03.979 align:start position:0%
I have no other people oh okay
 
04:23:08.330 --> 04:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
apparently we have another pink card
 
04:23:08.340 --> 04:23:15.910 align:start position:0%
apparently we have another pink card
foreign

04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:21.889 --> 04:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
committee um it's a privilege to sit up
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
here again I think this bill is
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
incredibly well intentioned
 
04:23:33.889 --> 04:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
I am uh scratching my head trying to
 
04:23:35.330 --> 04:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
figure out what this body actually
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
thinks they're going to accomplish with
 
04:23:38.090 --> 04:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:23:39.650 --> 04:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
um of all the companies I've worked for
 
04:23:40.849 --> 04:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
I worked for one of the largest
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
biotechnology companies and I learned
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
two things when I was there I was told
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
by the head of a very large department
 
04:23:49.490 --> 04:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
at MGH I'm not going to throw his name
 
04:23:49.500 --> 04:23:50.450 align:start position:0%
at MGH I'm not going to throw his name
out

04:23:50.450 --> 04:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
the company I work for was a great legal
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
organization with a small biotech
 
04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
attached to it
 
04:23:56.929 --> 04:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
the biggest office this company had
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
which I think everyone here would
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognize was in Washington D.C
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
when I saw the amount of money that the
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
company spends on lobbying not only in
 
04:24:06.530 --> 04:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
DC but in each and every state level
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
ahead of approvals my head spun
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
how this body is going to stay up on
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies baffles me
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a member of the American Society of
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
hematology the American Society of
 
04:24:21.769 --> 04:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
clinical oncology and the American
 
04:24:24.110 --> 04:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
Association of cancer research I spent
 
04:24:26.050 --> 04:24:26.060 align:start position:0%
about a week at each of those
 
04:24:28.849 --> 04:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
organizations every year trying to keep
 
04:24:31.010 --> 04:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
up on just that narrow focus of those
 
04:24:31.020 --> 04:24:32.150 align:start position:0%
up on just that narrow focus of those
areas

04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and when you go to that there's 20 000
 
04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
people at each of those you don't keep
 
04:24:37.610 --> 04:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
up on the entire field if you go ask
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
hematologists go to Dartmouth go down to
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
MGH go to the Farber they have
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
Specialists who specialize in one
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
disease they spend all day looking into
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
the newest Technologies companies are
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
lining up to see these people how are
 
04:24:51.050 --> 04:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
you going to stay on top of emerging
 
04:24:53.929 --> 04:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
Technologies and if you do do they
 
04:24:55.969 --> 04:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
present equal risks to the people of New
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is if people see take
 
04:25:00.530 --> 04:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
smoking for example that used to be
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
recommended by physicians to pregnant
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
women to relax them we know that that's
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
not a good thing we know that it leads
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
to several types of cancer including
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer which we just chatted
 
04:25:10.080 --> 04:25:10.910 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer which we just chatted
about

04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:25:12.889 --> 04:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
I've seen people walking into this
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
building at outside the building smoking
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
cigarettes today do they not know
 
04:25:16.920 --> 04:25:18.170 align:start position:0%
cigarettes today do they not know
they're

04:25:18.170 --> 04:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:25:20.210 --> 04:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
whatever information this body could
 
04:25:21.889 --> 04:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
make people aware of they were aware of
 
04:25:24.530 --> 04:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
and most unfortunately the late
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
honorable representative Rogers was well
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
aware of two biomarkers she had that
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
directly led to her death that she was
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
aware of in 2012. I told her in
 
04:25:33.540 --> 04:25:34.969 align:start position:0%
aware of in 2012. I told her in
committee

04:25:34.969 --> 04:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you're hoping to
 
04:25:38.330 --> 04:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
accomplish there are a lot of people out
 
04:25:40.689 --> 04:25:40.699 align:start position:0%
there working on emerging Technologies
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
less than 10 percent that get into
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
humans actually make it to Market and
 
04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
long before they get to Market I
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee you companies are spending a
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
lot of money to send lobbyists to come
 
04:25:52.250 --> 04:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
find all of you
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
without question and with that I'd be
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.969 --> 04:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes
 
04:26:07.250 --> 04:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
other are there other states that that
 
04:26:14.330 --> 04:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
have bodies like this and do you know
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
what kind of output they've had
 
04:26:19.010 --> 04:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
with respect to Pharma companies and
 
04:26:20.809 --> 04:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
biotech I have not had that such
 
04:26:23.210 --> 04:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
encounters at all I believe most
 
04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
companies hire lobbyists specifically at
 
04:26:28.250 --> 04:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
the state level and at the federal level
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
they have both lobbyists and Incredibly
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
large law offices
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
for taking this question is your is your
 
04:26:42.130 --> 04:26:42.140 align:start position:0%
concern specifically that we are
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
creating a target for lobbyists not not
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
at all I I think you're taking on far
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
too big a uh bite if you will
 
04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
to be able to stay where are you going
 
04:26:55.729 --> 04:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
to focus is it going to be on cancer is
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
it going to be on inflammation the two
 
04:26:59.889 --> 04:26:59.899 align:start position:0%
are actually related it you know it
 
04:27:01.969 --> 04:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
Endocrinology is it going to be surgery
 
04:27:03.769 --> 04:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
is it going to be medical devices and
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
medical devices how many different
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
subtypes are there
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow up so and in regard to the your
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
comments about lobbyists
 
04:27:15.769 --> 04:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
I I I'm assuming that you're thinking
 
04:27:17.570 --> 04:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
that those lobbyists will come whether
 
04:27:20.570 --> 04:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
there's this kind of committee or not a
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
hundred a hundred percent and I think
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably the most relevant one that
 
04:27:25.370 --> 04:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
would be very easy for anyone to spend
 
04:27:26.929 --> 04:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
30 seconds online and find is
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
immunotherapy and cancer
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
when the therapies first came out I have
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
an aunt whose life was extended by seven
 
04:27:34.610 --> 04:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
years she was diagnosed within three
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
weeks of approval of the first
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
immunotherapy drug approved
 
04:27:39.889 --> 04:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
they come with horrible side effects
 
04:27:42.050 --> 04:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
companies were doing everything they
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
could to get in front of every
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislative body every reimbursement
 
04:27:48.050 --> 04:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
organization they could ahead of this
 
04:27:49.729 --> 04:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
not to mention trying to educate
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
Physicians nurses pharmacists Etc what
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
needed to happen to make these drugs
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
available to patients along with the
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
potential risks which included death and
 
04:28:02.450 --> 04:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
long-term sequelae of how to manage them
 
04:28:04.130 --> 04:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is very well
 
04:28:06.530 --> 04:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
intentioned I think it's uh it's too big
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
a bite for for any single body to bite
 
04:28:09.180 --> 04:28:09.950 align:start position:0%
a bite for for any single body to bite
off

04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Palmer
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
so but in a way you're arguing for this
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise this people in the state and
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislators are going to hear primarily
 
04:28:26.090 --> 04:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
from the lobbyists and not from a body
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's maybe been able to do some
 
04:28:29.809 --> 04:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
research as an individual I'll never be
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
able to keep up this committee at least
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
would have a shot at keeping up is that
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
not true
 
04:28:38.090 --> 04:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
when I left graduate school at Dartmouth
 
04:28:40.490 --> 04:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
in 2004 there was an article in Journal
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
of American Medical Association if a
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
physician and his or her specialty read
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
two papers a day by the end of the year
 
04:28:50.330 --> 04:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
they'd be several hundred papers behind
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's very Noble to try and take
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
this on where you're going to focus how
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
are you going to know this and things
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
that get propelled from phase one that
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
go to a registration study right there's
 
04:29:02.450 --> 04:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
phase one two and three these can take
 
04:29:04.490 --> 04:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
several years there are some that are so
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly convincing they get
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly accelerated are you going to
 
04:29:11.210 --> 04:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
miss those will you pick them all up
 
04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a very big bite that the
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh Noble but a very big bike the
 
04:29:21.610 --> 04:29:21.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.689 --> 04:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
04:29:25.849 --> 04:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:29:25.859 --> 04:29:26.809 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't have any FN to it
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's not going to cost taxpayers
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
anything and
 
04:29:33.479 --> 04:29:34.370 align:start position:0%
anything and
um

04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:36.649 --> 04:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
everybody who would be a member of this
 
04:29:38.450 --> 04:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
committee my understanding is that it
 
04:29:39.950 --> 04:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
would be volunteer based right so
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
nobody's being forced to join this
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee and it does seem like yes it
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
could be a big waste of time on their
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
part but that's a big cost if they want
 
04:29:50.809 --> 04:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
to do that well but that's if they want
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
to do that so I'm just curious what do
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
you think is the worst case scenario
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
this committee gets you know built
 
04:29:57.649 --> 04:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
what's the worst thing that could happen
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
from it other than a bunch of people get
 
04:30:00.410 --> 04:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
together and they just waste their time
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's probably the worst
 
04:30:04.189 --> 04:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen and you have a
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
lot of important work to do
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
and have been doing a lot of important
 
04:30:07.739 --> 04:30:09.710 align:start position:0%
and have been doing a lot of important
work

04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:30:11.570 --> 04:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
is this body going to produce something
 
04:30:13.729 --> 04:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
of value for the people of New Hampshire
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
for the residents of New Hampshire with
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:22.969 --> 04:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
hi oh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious because I totally
 
04:30:31.130 --> 04:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:30:33.410 --> 04:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious though would there
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
be any value in this being react and I'm
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
going to get back to the stem cell thing
 
04:30:37.319 --> 04:30:38.090 align:start position:0%
going to get back to the stem cell thing
again

04:30:38.090 --> 04:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
any value that's being reactive as
 
04:30:42.410 --> 04:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to proactive because proactive
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be Beyond Comprehension
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
whereas reactive there's issues that the
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
state faces on a regular basis that it
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have a bunch of
 
04:30:51.479 --> 04:30:52.750 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have a bunch of
experts

04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
experts
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
100 100 on that if you're then you could
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
look at specific cases
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and if I can go out on a Ledge I've
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Merchant
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
before with one company I used to work
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
with the biggest line items for CMS that
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
literally the biggest line item for CMS
 
04:31:12.050 --> 04:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately in retrospect I think
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of commercial influence
 
04:31:18.110 --> 04:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
that that emanated from at least a
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
couple companies that pushed out
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
it still benefited some patients to have
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
a body be able to focus just on those
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
particular drugs where they can be used
 
04:31:28.800 --> 04:31:29.710 align:start position:0%
particular drugs where they can be used
um

04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think there could absolutely be value
 
04:31:34.010 --> 04:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
in that and especially when there are
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
drugs that exist out right now that may
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
have been purposed for one disease and I
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
think this was brought up brought up by
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
a representative Pearson in his
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
testimony if you have a
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
drug that has been used for one disease
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
and may be repurposed in another disease
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think of something I
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
haven't touched
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccine or
 
04:31:56.210 --> 04:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
that was almost instantly repurposed
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
with high efficacy for monkeypox
 
04:31:58.500 --> 04:31:59.750 align:start position:0%
with high efficacy for monkeypox
that's

04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
would be terrific for this committee to
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
be able to put together ad hoc a small
 
04:32:06.410 --> 04:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee and focus on just that maybe
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's something else that's coming out
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
and I think with the number of
 
04:32:11.330 --> 04:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers on this committee
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
with Healthcare experience you would
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
probably stay much more abreast of
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
not up and coming Technologies but
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
technologies that are either already
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
approved or so incredibly close to
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
approval you know they've been on the
 
04:32:24.420 --> 04:32:26.929 align:start position:0%
approval you know they've been on the
news

04:32:26.929 --> 04:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.490 --> 04:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's
 
04:32:30.769 --> 04:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
04:32:36.170 --> 04:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
with the committee being there part of
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
it what I would say is
 
04:32:44.450 --> 04:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
it allows the community to hear emerging
 
04:32:46.849 --> 04:32:46.859 align:start position:0%
Technologies in the barriers that we
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
have legislatively
 
04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
versus trying to figure out which one's
 
04:32:52.370 --> 04:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
to support but trying to understand from
 
04:32:54.769 --> 04:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
the industry what's emerging and what we
 
04:32:56.570 --> 04:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
can do to try to Foster it to understand
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
it with the scientists involved
 
04:33:00.410 --> 04:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I see it headed
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
versus trying to look at the whole Apple
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
like you said it's a huge Universe out
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
there but I would turn around say would
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
you be okay with the people coming to
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
this committee saying these are concerns
 
04:33:12.769 --> 04:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
we have legislatively that are barriers
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
to us bringing this technology to Market
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I think being able to work with
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
companies who are the ones developing
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
drugs that could absolutely work
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
especially if the committee were to set
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
the interface not as a lobbyist who's
 
04:33:29.090 --> 04:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
paid but you have a medical director you
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
have a global development the people who
 
04:33:33.289 --> 04:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
are in charge of development that from
 
04:33:35.209 --> 04:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
the scientists who who is either
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the pathway the
 
04:33:40.131 --> 04:33:40.141 align:start position:0%
medical technology Etc the people most
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
closely associated with it and on the
 
04:33:44.449 --> 04:33:44.459 align:start position:0%
commercial side how how do you pay for
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
it what are what are going to be the
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
barriers and as far as nurses how do you
 
04:33:48.061 --> 04:33:49.189 align:start position:0%
barriers and as far as nurses how do you
navigate

04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
patient a walks in the door
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
what's going to change from standard
 
04:33:54.131 --> 04:33:54.141 align:start position:0%
medical practice
 
04:33:56.631 --> 04:33:56.641 align:start position:0%
what can the state do to support that by
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
all means
 
04:34:00.170 --> 04:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
I did want to make a comment I want to
 
04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
say thank you spending the time which
 
04:34:04.849 --> 04:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to you help educate me
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
on many things and I think it was that
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
education which has helped me within the
 
04:34:10.730 --> 04:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
medical center to try to understand how
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
to make it work within the medical
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
center so I want to say thank you
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you kindly other questions
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
seeing any other questions
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.090 --> 04:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards who's a
 
04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and the committee
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm representative Jess Edwards
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
representing uh Rock Rockingham District
 
04:34:48.890 --> 04:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
31. uh I didn't intend to speak today uh
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
but I I thought some of what I might
 
04:34:52.730 --> 04:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
have to say could be useful to you as
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
you decide how you want to dispose of
 
04:34:58.250 --> 04:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I yeah I'm recommending
 
04:35:03.890 --> 04:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
OTP uh I I think much of the concerns uh
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
and opportunities have been sort of
 
04:35:08.689 --> 04:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
suggested by committee members but I I
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh drive into a couple
 
04:35:16.970 --> 04:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
specific points on page two line 15 the
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
committee shall well the committee shall
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you start to read those bullets it's
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
basically about having the legislature
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
improve awareness understanding and uh
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and understand emerging medical
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
Technologies initially where this all
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
got its momentum was in the biomarker
 
04:35:40.849 --> 04:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
bill and as we started to try to figure
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
out what to do with the biomarker bill
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
we realized that you know that issue
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't right but that the field of
 
04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
emerging medical technology is extremely
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
expansive and going in all directions
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
personally my background in this area
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
has been in positron a mission
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
tomography co-registration a functional
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
and structural Imaging the medical
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
imaging in general telemedicine so those
 
04:36:08.449 --> 04:36:08.459 align:start position:0%
were all at one point emerging medical
 
04:36:11.390 --> 04:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
technologies that I think have become
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
ripe in one way or another for some
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
legislative action this committee would
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
be established so that there would be a
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the legislature to have
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
better awareness of those Trends we're
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
not we're not driving the train you know
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
basically I think our job is to as a
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislature is to lead follow or get the
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
heck out of the way and what this
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
committee would do would be sort of an
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
indication to us on what is the
 
04:36:42.910 --> 04:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate role of the legislator
 
04:36:46.090 --> 04:36:46.100 align:start position:0%
legislature like for example on line 21
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
are there barriers that should be
 
04:36:51.529 --> 04:36:51.539 align:start position:0%
examined to see if the if somehow we've
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
got some archaic legislative structure
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe needs to be addressed
 
04:37:01.490 --> 04:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know when when the Army money uh
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
came to us for the regenerative
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know body parts whatever
 
04:37:07.199 --> 04:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
I don't know body parts whatever
um

04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:10.010 --> 04:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
there weren't a lot of people in the
 
04:37:12.289 --> 04:37:12.299 align:start position:0%
house that understood that issue to
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
begin with so we ended up helping
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
by providing tax breaks or subsidies
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
that were significant so we do get
 
04:37:25.730 --> 04:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
involved in emergency emerging medical
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
Technologies from time to time hopefully
 
04:37:31.730 --> 04:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
this go this committee would would help
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
us with that sort of awareness before
 
04:37:36.609 --> 04:37:36.619 align:start position:0%
somebody asks us to write a check
 
04:37:40.490 --> 04:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
also we get involved with the payer
 
04:37:43.010 --> 04:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
decision making Medicaid specifically
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
spends a lot of money and there's a
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
there was a bill to require that all
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
telemedicine be reimbursed at a rate
 
04:37:55.490 --> 04:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
equal to the clinical inpatient rate
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
that was a legislative decision on
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
evaluating emerging medical technology
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
in its current state and in its future
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
state so we end up getting called into
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
making these decisions and I and I I
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have any organized
 
04:38:16.369 --> 04:38:16.379 align:start position:0%
structure to help us be smart in in that
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
area uh there's a patient privacy aspect
 
04:38:21.529 --> 04:38:21.539 align:start position:0%
to this in all emerging technology we
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
got to worry about uh potential effects
 
04:38:27.289 --> 04:38:27.299 align:start position:0%
of privacy there there's there's not a
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
whole lot of bad that can happen with
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
um we've got a major filter these guys
 
04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
this committee goes and reports through
 
04:38:40.730 --> 04:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight to propose legislation HHS
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
oversight which in itself is not a
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
really a standing policy committee so so
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're building a highly
 
04:38:52.209 --> 04:38:52.219 align:start position:0%
responsive uh system
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
we say it should only meet once a year
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
well why do we say that we say that it
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
can meet more frequently should there be
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
a need but once a year yes sir we would
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
we would take a survey of what's taking
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
place for for General situational
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
awareness and and disband and if this
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
turns out to be a feckless Board of
 
04:39:15.769 --> 04:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
human beings it sunsets itself in just a
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
few years you know so to your to your
 
04:39:20.929 --> 04:39:20.939 align:start position:0%
question why is there a sunset well
 
04:39:22.490 --> 04:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
because this is a this is a grand
 
04:39:25.849 --> 04:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
experiment and if it if if it's a waste
 
04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
then it shuts itself down if it's not
 
04:39:31.369 --> 04:39:31.379 align:start position:0%
then we can keep it going but uh so so
 
04:39:33.769 --> 04:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
so I think I think that should help with
 
04:39:36.410 --> 04:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
a little bit of perspective on why this
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
is proposed you know what if you think
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea or not it's totally up
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
to you I think it's a it's an okay idea
 
04:39:45.410 --> 04:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
 
04:39:48.670 --> 04:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Edwards
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you none thank you very much
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman McDonald
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
 
04:40:01.610 --> 04:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I see government oversight more like
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
the eye of Zaron and when it finds
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
something it generally tends to destroy
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
the good as opposed to get get things
 
04:40:11.208 --> 04:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
that are bad out of the way and I like
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
your testimony that it could potentially
 
04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
find barriers to
 
04:40:18.050 --> 04:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
um something that is needed but there's
 
04:40:19.550 --> 04:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a government barrier that they can
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
get out of the way
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but is that realistic I mean do you
 
04:40:24.830 --> 04:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
really see that a government committee
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
is going to look for ways to get the
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
government out of the way that that's
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
like totally antithetical to what like
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
most government is I just it seems to me
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
like the government and people that are
 
04:40:35.690 --> 04:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
staffed in it they want to create more
 
04:40:37.850 --> 04:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
laws and they oftentimes kill the baby
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the crib so that's my concern
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
so I share your deep cynicism but not
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
your not your choice of fan fiction so
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
but I think I can understand where
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
you're going with that
 
04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I uh I I think we built this in a way
 
04:40:56.930 --> 04:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
in which it can't really do a lot of
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
harm even if the if they wanted to
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
um so uh and I would point out that uh
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
the legislature has in fact played a
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
very significant policy role in uh
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
furthering the acceptance of
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
telemedicine in New Hampshire uh it was
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
not more than six years ago where the
 
04:41:21.770 --> 04:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
commercial carriers were reimbursing for
 
04:41:24.170 --> 04:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and Medicaid really was not
 
04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
and so we as a policy decision I think
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
it went through HHS made the
 
04:41:32.330 --> 04:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
determination that Medicaid would get in
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the game and follow the lead of
 
04:41:37.730 --> 04:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
commercial carriers so that telemedicine
 
04:41:40.070 --> 04:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
could become more accepted we did that
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
at a policy level saying okay if if we
 
04:41:46.010 --> 04:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
get more consistency amongst the payers
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
the providers will then think okay this
 
04:41:51.288 --> 04:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
is a reimbursable service I'm going to
 
04:41:53.690 --> 04:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
go ahead and invest in this emerging
 
04:41:57.010 --> 04:41:57.020 align:start position:0%
technology and so so
 
04:41:59.690 --> 04:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
I would never underestimate the ability
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
of government to do damage but we do
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
have a track record of doing some good
 
04:42:07.730 --> 04:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire as well
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:19.368 --> 04:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to speak on
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
has anyone else wish to speak on House
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 323
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
04:42:30.050 --> 04:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 323
 
04:42:31.730 --> 04:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
we have noticed to go into executive
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
session at 1 30. it is now past 1 30. so
 
04:42:37.128 --> 04:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
I am going to begin and open the
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
note the presence of two substitute
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
members so representative page is here
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
for representative Tellez and
 
04:43:00.250 --> 04:43:00.260 align:start position:0%
representative naughter or
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative colfault thank you and
 
04:43:05.090 --> 04:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
welcome both and and could I also

apologize to the people who were sitting
 
04:43:08.448 --> 04:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
in front of the windows I opened at

lunchtime and thank you for shouting
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
them again actually the one that's still

open but it uh I don't feels kind of
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
good in here so
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
much better than it did last Friday
 
04:43:22.610 --> 04:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
I would have last Friday yes what's that
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
does anyone want the window shot or
 
04:43:26.570 --> 04:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable
 
04:43:28.850 --> 04:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
I guess everybody's comfortable but
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:32.930 --> 04:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
okay again we are now in executive
 
04:43:32.940 --> 04:43:34.490 align:start position:0%
okay again we are now in executive
session

04:43:34.490 --> 04:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:43:37.250 --> 04:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the um we dealt with uh House Bill
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
91- FNA last week so the first bill for
 
04:43:45.890 --> 04:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
us to consider today is HP 587 FN and
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
I'd recognize representative McLean for
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would make a motion
 
04:43:52.850 --> 04:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.170 --> 04:43:59.180 align:start position:0%
representative let me just read the
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
blurb about what bill it is not just the
 
04:44:04.490 --> 04:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
number okay I'm sorry uh and I'm sorry I
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
had to answer relative to a New
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first designation on the donor
 
04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
registry for anatomical gifts
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%

04:44:14.580 --> 04:44:17.208 align:start position:0%
is that is that enough representative or
okay

04:44:17.208 --> 04:44:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%

discussion

04:44:29.150 --> 04:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh McLean would you like
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion uh yes uh thank
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:44:39.890 --> 04:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the management of of
 
04:44:42.170 --> 04:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
organs for donation is something that is
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
done at the federal level so I don't
 
04:44:46.128 --> 04:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
know that this
 
04:44:48.530 --> 04:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
um legislation would would do anything
 
04:44:51.530 --> 04:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh relative to to the issues that the
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
sponsors brought forward
 
04:44:55.490 --> 04:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and also I don't know that we have a
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the relative flow of
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
organs into the state and out of the
 
04:45:03.530 --> 04:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
state so I I really think that we should
 
04:45:06.050 --> 04:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
wait and get more data so that we might
 
04:45:08.448 --> 04:45:08.458 align:start position:0%
understand better how this might impact
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh the the transmission of
 
04:45:13.490 --> 04:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
organs in an organ donation thank you Mr
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative McLean
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
I would say that my my first thought on
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was to an expedient to
 
04:45:27.530 --> 04:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
legislate for any number of reasons that
 
04:45:30.890 --> 04:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
we heard but I have to say that in light
 
04:45:34.368 --> 04:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
of the very conflicting testimony that
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
04:45:38.330 --> 04:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
um if it's the pleasure of the committee
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't see that as a problem
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
but I would love to hear from other
 
04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
people about their thoughts sure
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:45:54.650 --> 04:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
um personally I was very moved by the
 
04:45:57.170 --> 04:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
two people who came to testify who said
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
they had both received
 
04:45:59.400 --> 04:46:00.708 align:start position:0%
they had both received
um

04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
a heart and were here 10 years later and
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
20 years later one with a little baby
 
04:46:09.530 --> 04:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I was and I was very moved by their
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
testimony that had have if New Hampshire
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
passes legislation like this and other
 
04:46:19.010 --> 04:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
states respond by passing similar
 
04:46:19.020 --> 04:46:20.410 align:start position:0%
states respond by passing similar
legislation

04:46:20.410 --> 04:46:20.420 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:46:22.850 --> 04:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
that they might not have had those
 
04:46:26.930 --> 04:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
organs available to them so I came set
 
04:46:31.010 --> 04:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
to vote for itl at the same time I was
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
very moved by a couple of legislators
 
04:46:36.050 --> 04:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
one who I've known while they've gone
 
04:46:37.610 --> 04:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
through the process of getting a new
 
04:46:40.610 --> 04:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
kidney and how impassioned they were
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
about the bill so I would be very
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
amenable to voting to retain the bill
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
and thinking about it more and hearing
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
more about it later on
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to speak any
 
04:46:56.930 --> 04:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I'll ask the clerk
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
to call the wall
 
04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
again the motion is to retain on House
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%

04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we also dealt with House Bill 47 last
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
week which was relative to medical
 
04:49:16.128 --> 04:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:16.138 --> 04:49:29.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:29.288 --> 04:49:29.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes we did yes so next up for our
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
consideration today is the house bill
 
04:49:33.840 --> 04:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
consideration today is the house bill
223

04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
223
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.080 --> 04:49:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:43.730 --> 04:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion representative
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant would you like to make a motion
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
yes I'll make a motion OTP okay is there
 
04:49:50.208 --> 04:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
a second to that motion
 
04:49:52.250 --> 04:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
that representative Leon representative
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant would you like to speak to your
 
04:49:53.400 --> 04:49:55.368 align:start position:0%
Merchant would you like to speak to your
motion

04:49:55.368 --> 04:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:49:57.288 --> 04:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's a simple bill in a sense that we
 
04:50:01.850 --> 04:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
learn that
 
04:50:03.830 --> 04:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
drugs under the Control prescription act
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
is rarely abused as far as being used
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
topically for testosterone in this bill
 
04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
basically provides a patient the
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have it filled four times
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
a year versus 12 times a year it doesn't
 
04:50:21.650 --> 04:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
stop the use of the drug based upon the
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
need for the patient and basically at
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
this point in time as it said in a bill
 
04:50:29.410 --> 04:50:29.420 align:start position:0%
before there's two parts to it one is
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
abuse and the other one's corresponding
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility by having the provider or
 
04:50:36.288 --> 04:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
the prescriber right on the prescription
 
04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
the medical need for it it helps
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
alleviate the concern that the
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacist may have in violation of
 
04:50:44.448 --> 04:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
corresponding responsibility with the
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
DEA so therefore I support the bill
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
okay the discussion
 
04:50:52.250 --> 04:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
I suppose sorry I support the bill
 
04:50:54.350 --> 04:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
because many other prescriptions can be
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
done on a quarterly basis this is just
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
giving an exemption to the controlled
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
Drug Act and uh when you look at the
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
dose dose makes the poison and dose also
 
04:51:03.170 --> 04:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
makes it whether or not it's it's
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
something that can reasonably be abused
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
or not and I don't imagine anybody
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
swimming in tubes of uh these topical
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I support the bill
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
as well um and my only thought that we
 
04:51:21.650 --> 04:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
had talked about that I wanted to
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize is that it perhaps at some
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
point it may be helpful to go through
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
all the schedule three drugs that may
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
by the rest of the week I think Monday I
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
think if we have it in today it may be
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
able to make it to the next time okay so
 
04:53:24.770 --> 04:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
no I'll always assume it about it but
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'll try to make it today but um I don't
 
04:53:39.288 --> 04:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay next up is uh House Bill 397
 
04:53:43.730 --> 04:53:43.740 align:start position:0%

04:53:45.420 --> 04:53:48.650 align:start position:0%
possession of hypodermic needles by
miners

04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
um apparently there's an amendment
 
04:53:51.890 --> 04:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
pending from this on this from what I
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
understand uh so I would like to
 
04:53:55.610 --> 04:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
continue this until tomorrow when we'll
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%

met ad hoc on Monday to try and look at
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
some amending language just to deal with
 
04:54:10.250 --> 04:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the concerns I think
 
04:54:11.448 --> 04:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
we're getting pretty close to that we
 
04:54:13.250 --> 04:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
just needed to have it drafted so um
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to have that
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
drafted for tomorrow we have agreement
 
04:54:18.770 --> 04:54:18.780 align:start position:0%

04:54:35.448 --> 04:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
two we have conflicting schedules here I
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
tried to be organized but I did it in a
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
different order I apologize too many
 
04:54:43.150 --> 04:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:45.530 --> 04:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
well if you've seen my cooking or tasted
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
my cooking you'd know
 
04:54:52.150 --> 04:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.208 --> 04:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
um 6 14 because we just heard that
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that one won't be until
 
04:55:02.760 --> 04:55:06.830 align:start position:0%
amendment that one won't be until
tomorrow

04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:06.840 --> 04:55:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:08.520 --> 04:55:10.670 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to also
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
continuing HB 614 and also be continuing
 
04:55:19.070 --> 04:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
HB 282
 
04:55:22.448 --> 04:55:22.458 align:start position:0%
at 6 14 will be continued until tomorrow
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
and HB 282 will be continued until next
 
04:55:30.830 --> 04:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay now we're going to go out a little
 
04:55:35.448 --> 04:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
bit out of order
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
could we know the reason for the
 
04:55:45.890 --> 04:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
32 we're basically
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
there's still some discussions ongoing
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
with trying to
 
04:55:54.050 --> 04:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
come to some kind of a
 
04:55:56.770 --> 04:55:56.780 align:start position:0%
you know Focus among a number of us
 
04:56:01.628 --> 04:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
that's okay and so
 
04:56:01.638 --> 04:56:03.550 align:start position:0%
that's okay and so
three

04:56:03.550 --> 04:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
Thirty so could you go through the list
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
again of the ones that are going to be
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow just because I didn't catch up
 
04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
as you were saying them sure I'm sorry
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
uh hb614 is going to be tomorrow okay
 
04:56:19.368 --> 04:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
I've got that one and HB 397. okay and
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.050 --> 04:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
okay what was the last one 282
 
04:56:32.690 --> 04:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
is that 15th
 
04:56:35.090 --> 04:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you we're all working off
 
04:56:37.730 --> 04:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
different lists I know I know
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm getting confused a little
 
04:56:41.208 --> 04:56:41.218 align:start position:0%
bit too so
 
04:56:44.170 --> 04:56:44.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
so in regards to 282 of which on the
 
04:56:49.368 --> 04:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
sponsor I'm not sure what you meant by
 
04:56:52.128 --> 04:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
this ongoing discussions but
 
04:56:52.138 --> 04:56:52.788 align:start position:0%
this ongoing discussions but
um

04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:55.010 --> 04:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
if there are ongoing discussions and it
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I would certainly
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
welcome being part of those okay
 
04:56:58.320 --> 04:57:01.368 align:start position:0%
welcome being part of those okay
absolutely

04:57:01.368 --> 04:57:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.470 --> 04:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
04:57:03.480 --> 04:57:06.850 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
foreign

04:57:06.850 --> 04:57:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
so again we're going to go a little bit
 
04:57:11.330 --> 04:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
out of order here and jump over to 590
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
HB 598 relative to funding maternal
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that motion second
 
04:57:34.930 --> 04:57:34.940 align:start position:0%
representative McLean seconds
 
04:57:37.010 --> 04:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer I'm sorry I'll
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
raise the other hand next time
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
I was Bill 598.
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant would you like
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
right yes I would thank you Mr chair
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of the online bill is
 
04:57:53.930 --> 04:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
well intended
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
however to take money out of an existing
 
04:57:57.890 --> 04:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
program and transfer it to another
 
04:57:57.900 --> 04:57:58.910 align:start position:0%
program and transfer it to another
program

04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think is ill-conceived we heard at
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
least I did and testimony of how the
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
other program is working fairly well
 
04:58:09.650 --> 04:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
they rely upon this funding and to take
 
04:58:12.170 --> 04:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
the funding out of that stream
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
you'll have a significant impact on
 
04:58:15.410 --> 04:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
their organization I think domestic
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
violence is extremely important and as
 
04:58:19.850 --> 04:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
the legislative body we need to continue
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
to support it so therefore I'm opposed
 
04:58:25.490 --> 04:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
to the bill as is written
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
and I would like to recommend which I
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
did ideal
 
04:58:33.650 --> 04:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.448 --> 04:58:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:35.458 --> 04:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.530 --> 04:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
you have to be smarter than the plug
 
04:58:47.700 --> 04:58:48.708 align:start position:0%
you have to be smarter than the plug
which

04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:58:48.718 --> 04:58:50.288 align:start position:0%
which
is

04:58:50.288 --> 04:58:50.298 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:58:53.448 --> 04:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
comes Downstream
 
04:58:55.260 --> 04:58:58.448 align:start position:0%
comes Downstream
oh

04:58:58.448 --> 04:58:58.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
yours yours is working it's just the
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
ones Downstream of you that are gone
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it has only one position works
 
04:59:13.440 --> 04:59:16.850 align:start position:0%
because it has only one position works
sure

04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:16.860 --> 04:59:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:17.810 --> 04:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
mine is working all of those are not
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
working because but anyway the point
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
that I was going to make was that
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:37.610 --> 04:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
we were given a fairly robust
 
04:59:37.620 --> 04:59:41.330 align:start position:0%
we were given a fairly robust
discussion

04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
of maternal mortality and
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that given that we have a
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
significant body of uh research already
 
04:59:55.010 --> 04:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
on that in this state
 
04:59:59.410 --> 04:59:59.420 align:start position:0%
uh it's not necessary
 
05:00:02.570 --> 05:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh particularly to divert funding from
 
05:00:02.580 --> 05:00:04.250 align:start position:0%
uh particularly to divert funding from
other

05:00:04.250 --> 05:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:00:08.448 --> 05:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
equally important sources uh
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
particularly as it was pointed out to me
 
05:00:14.930 --> 05:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
the the difference in numbers between
 
05:00:14.940 --> 05:00:15.530 align:start position:0%
the the difference in numbers between
um

05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:18.288 --> 05:00:18.298 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality reviews which is a
 
05:00:21.050 --> 05:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
very important thing to do
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the one hand and the number of
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic and sexual violence
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the course of the state
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
many of whom also are killed so
 
05:00:34.138 --> 05:00:34.970 align:start position:0%
many of whom also are killed so
um

05:00:34.970 --> 05:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:38.208 --> 05:00:38.218 align:start position:0%
I'm that for that reason I am going to
 
05:00:39.708 --> 05:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
vote against the bill and I'm going to
 
05:00:41.448 --> 05:00:41.458 align:start position:0%
try very hard not to unplug anything
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
anymore and I think I thank my colleague
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
for her assistance
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:00:52.610 --> 05:00:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I too would support
 
05:00:56.930 --> 05:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
itl and um I think the intention of
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
making the maternal mortality review
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
more robust or strengthening it is uh is
 
05:01:06.650 --> 05:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
something I would absolutely support and
 
05:01:08.208 --> 05:01:08.218 align:start position:0%
I know we're not supposed to attribute
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
motives but um I would attribute
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
positive motives to the representative
 
05:01:16.368 --> 05:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
who brought the bill I absolutely trust
 
05:01:19.730 --> 05:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
his good intentions in making up for the
 
05:01:23.410 --> 05:01:23.420 align:start position:0%
funding for domestic violence funding
 
05:01:25.970 --> 05:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think that that's the
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
way government should work that we
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
should take a promise from one person
 
05:01:29.280 --> 05:01:30.890 align:start position:0%
should take a promise from one person
and

05:01:30.890 --> 05:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
um make that the reason to do something
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
I think you know had this bill come with
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
text about how each of those programs
 
05:01:40.970 --> 05:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
was going to be funded and that they
 
05:01:42.410 --> 05:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
were going to be funded at an adequate
 
05:01:45.650 --> 05:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
level or the same levels for domestic
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
violence I would vote for this but I
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
just don't think we should run
 
05:01:52.010 --> 05:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
government by taking one person's
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
statement that I'll make this work
 
05:01:58.250 --> 05:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote against the bill
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um one of the
 
05:02:04.610 --> 05:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
strange things that I did when I ran for
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
office was I promised to listen to my
 
05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
constituents and um I was very much
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
impressed with the number of emails that
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
I received in opposition to this and um
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
in in honor of that I'm going to vote to
 
05:02:19.440 --> 05:02:21.368 align:start position:0%
in in honor of that I'm going to vote to
itl

05:02:21.368 --> 05:02:21.378 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:02:23.570 --> 05:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
um I I was actually quite troubled by
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony we heard from the
 
05:02:31.970 --> 05:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
domestic violence group that none of the
 
05:02:34.010 --> 05:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
money was going to salaries and then we
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from one of the
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiary groups that that money did
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
go to salaries I think that there's more
 
05:02:41.090 --> 05:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
to look at within the domestic violence
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
fund but I don't think that this bill is
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily the right way to do that I
 
05:02:46.128 --> 05:02:46.138 align:start position:0%
think that we already have a clear
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
signal of the substance use disorder and
 
05:02:50.690 --> 05:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
I think that perhaps looking looking at
 
05:02:52.730 --> 05:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
making sure that those important
 
05:02:55.368 --> 05:02:55.378 align:start position:0%
domestic violence monies actually go to
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
benefiting these these women and men
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
because men are also victims of domestic
 
05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
violence but to make sure that these
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
people can be empowered and go from
 
05:03:05.930 --> 05:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
being a victim to being a Survivor and I
 
05:03:07.550 --> 05:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
think that that's worthy of future study
 
05:03:10.368 --> 05:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
but um I but because of that I prefer
 
05:03:11.448 --> 05:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
something that's a little bit more clean
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll be building itl
 
05:03:17.448 --> 05:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%

representative McDonald yes vote is 20
 
05:04:27.288 --> 05:04:27.298 align:start position:0%
to zero there's no objection we'll put
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
this on the consent calendar
 
05:04:32.330 --> 05:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay next uh for our consideration is a
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 264
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
relative to amendments and corrections
 
05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
to birth records representative lay on
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a motion uh yes I move to
 
05:04:44.570 --> 05:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 264.
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second uh representative
 
05:04:49.490 --> 05:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
mazur yes second please uh would you
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak to a motion representative
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
Leon uh yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:04:55.128 --> 05:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
um I think that a lot of the spill is
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward because we have other
 
05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
documents that reflect the the sex on
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
the driver's license and passports and
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
it would be retaining a copy within the
 
05:05:07.010 --> 05:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
records my biggest concern here is that
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to make sure that
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state or our schools haven't failed
 
05:05:13.128 --> 05:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
anybody in the process we have a very
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward path a relatively
 
05:05:17.448 --> 05:05:17.458 align:start position:0%
straightforward path in order to change
 
05:05:19.610 --> 05:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
your gender once but if you're returning
 
05:05:21.288 --> 05:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
to your birth gender
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
I I want to have a mechanism of
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
reporting if somebody feels that they
 
05:05:27.650 --> 05:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
were failed by policies that that's
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
heard because it's because it's a
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
challenging it's a challenging landscape
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
and it's one that that
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
presents personal issues it it's very
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
sensitive and I want to make sure that
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
the state is sensitive to it and also in
 
05:05:43.610 --> 05:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
addition we heard that without by
 
05:05:45.170 --> 05:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the court order as a
 
05:05:47.330 --> 05:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
process there may not be the way to have
 
05:05:48.530 --> 05:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
the name change and there's a couple
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
technical issues too so I think that
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
this is something that we can we can get
 
05:05:55.250 --> 05:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
to a good agreement on but I don't think
 
05:05:57.650 --> 05:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
that we're quite here yet and I really
 
05:06:00.530 --> 05:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
really do want to make sure that anybody
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
switching back has their voice fully
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
heard if they have anything to say and I
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that's secure
 
05:06:09.530 --> 05:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
that safety net is there
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion

um representative Cushman do you have a
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
motion yes I move that we
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
recommend HB 574 in expedient to
 
05:08:00.958 --> 05:08:02.810 align:start position:0%
recommend HB 574 in expedient to
legislate

05:08:02.810 --> 05:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:08:02.820 --> 05:08:04.010 align:start position:0%
legislate
second

05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:08:07.250 --> 05:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
discussion uh representative Congressman
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to your motion yes
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
um moving this Ito as we heard in the
 
05:08:19.850 --> 05:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are other programs
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
available to allow food stamps to be
 
05:08:25.730 --> 05:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
used at farmers markets and we heard
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
also in previous years that this program
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
was not re-established because of the
 
05:08:33.170 --> 05:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
low uptake in the the alternative
 
05:08:37.128 --> 05:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
programs in place and there's a sizable
 
05:08:40.490 --> 05:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
um amount of money going into this and a
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
large chunk of that is State funds and I
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
think that this bill should be laid to
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
rest this session
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
I have two separate amendments and I
 
05:09:08.890 --> 05:09:08.900 align:start position:0%
have now gotten my amendments confused
 
05:09:13.970 --> 05:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh this is the one for which we were
 
05:09:17.208 --> 05:09:17.218 align:start position:0%
trying to insert the words or forms that
 
05:09:19.390 --> 05:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
road signed Farm stands
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
and at the request of Representative
 
05:09:24.770 --> 05:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
Leon and I have an amendment that did
 
05:09:27.288 --> 05:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
that and then
 
05:09:27.298 --> 05:09:28.430 align:start position:0%
that and then
um

05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:28.440 --> 05:09:29.770 align:start position:0%
um
at

05:09:29.770 --> 05:09:29.780 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think I have now
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
I still haven't managed to correct the
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
problem with the first amendment that we
 
05:09:41.208 --> 05:09:41.218 align:start position:0%
had uh but I would certainly although I
 
05:09:44.090 --> 05:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
am not prepared to offer the right
 
05:09:46.250 --> 05:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the right bill because I
 
05:09:49.128 --> 05:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
got the wrong Amendment in haste last
 
05:09:49.138 --> 05:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
got the wrong Amendment in haste last
time

05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I would oppose the itl because I
 
05:09:56.208 --> 05:09:56.218 align:start position:0%
think this is a good program I think we
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
ought to get it in place this term this
 
05:10:02.810 --> 05:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
season and as we heard there are
 
05:10:05.270 --> 05:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for dealing with it so I am
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.850 --> 05:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I believe that if we do move
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
forward with this program we do need to
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
include roadside stands but I do think
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the large states spend when we're
 
05:10:23.330 --> 05:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with when we're dealing with
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
larger larger issues in the economy
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
which I know impact food but we also do
 
05:10:31.490 --> 05:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
have other mechanisms to get money at
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
these farmers markets and these roadside
 
05:10:35.330 --> 05:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
stands right now we're flesh and money
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just very very cautious in what we
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
do how we stand it up and the low
 
05:10:41.208 --> 05:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
utilization rates that we had
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
um this is one where when the chips fall
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
on one side or the other I don't think
 
05:10:47.810 --> 05:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is quite this is the right year at
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
this point but if it does move forward I
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
would like to see that roadside stands
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
are included
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Shapiro
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not sure I understand
 
05:11:02.650 --> 05:11:02.660 align:start position:0%
but I remember
 
05:11:05.090 --> 05:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
hearing that the state money
 
05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
appropriation was money that would then
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed by federal money and that
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
actually the cost of the program would
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
be paid for by federal monies I'm not
 
05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not totally clear about that but I
 
05:11:19.250 --> 05:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
wonder if
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
someone in the committee it looks like
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee is ready or
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
someone in the audience can answer that
 
05:11:28.368 --> 05:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:11:29.930 --> 05:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I can answer it for
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure but I did speak to the prime
 
05:11:33.170 --> 05:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor and he thought that it was only
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
Federal money then looking into it and
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
trying to talk to the talking to the
 
05:11:37.080 --> 05:11:38.270 align:start position:0%
trying to talk to the talking to the
department

05:11:38.270 --> 05:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
um there's also State money so that it
 
05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
goes from a ten dollar annual benefit to
 
05:11:44.930 --> 05:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
a 30 annual benefit in order to make it
 
05:11:47.090 --> 05:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
more meaningful so part of the process
 
05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
from last year when it was just the ten
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
dollars was that it was sweetening the
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
pot with some State money so that it'd
 
05:11:55.610 --> 05:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
be a more sizable amount but this is
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
still going to be a one-time field trip
 
05:11:59.868 --> 05:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
to a roadside stand ten dollars or
 
05:12:01.970 --> 05:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars that's the question do we
 
05:12:03.470 --> 05:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
get into where we take out the state
 
05:12:05.570 --> 05:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
money put it into Federal and sunset it
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
or say right now we already have this we
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
have a question about if we're going to
 
05:12:13.490 --> 05:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
require these Farmers to take it it's
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
complex it had a low utilization rate
 
05:12:17.090 --> 05:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
and we have other really important
 
05:12:20.448 --> 05:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
processes to work on as well so there is
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
confusion over whether it's state or
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
federal but my understanding is that 200
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
000 of it is State money in addition
 
05:12:29.690 --> 05:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
addition to seventy thousand to support
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the program on those to support the
 
05:12:32.930 --> 05:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
05:12:32.940 --> 05:12:34.310 align:start position:0%
federal program
approximately

05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh I was just going to make the point
 
05:12:38.760 --> 05:12:39.890 align:start position:0%
uh I was just going to make the point
that

05:12:39.890 --> 05:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
um were the policy committee and where
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
the health policy committee and I am all
 
05:12:49.610 --> 05:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
in favor of anything that gets fresh
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables into anybody's
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
hands under any circumstances and it
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is a an early bill so it will be
 
05:12:59.330 --> 05:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
going to the finance committee after
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
this to live or die in in the pot with
 
05:13:05.930 --> 05:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
all the other good policy that people
 
05:13:09.890 --> 05:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
come up with so I'm very calm I'm very
 
05:13:12.770 --> 05:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable passing it as a matter of
 
05:13:15.830 --> 05:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
Health policy and leaving the funding
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
questions to the place where they really
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
ought to be decided
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative Shapiro
 
05:13:25.250 --> 05:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
vote against itl as well and um I know
 
05:13:30.770 --> 05:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
that we are all guilty once in a while
 
05:13:33.530 --> 05:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
of using Hyperbole and um it's probably
 
05:13:35.570 --> 05:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
hyperbole to say that this is going to
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
change the nutrition will have
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
nutritional habits or the nutritional
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
intake for the people who use this it's
 
05:13:45.368 --> 05:13:45.378 align:start position:0%
it's just thirty dollars one time a year
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so I don't want to make that
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
argument but I would make an argument
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
similar to representative Weber's that
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
 
05:13:59.448 --> 05:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
that supports Farmers it supports the
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
right of people to enjoy fresh fruits
 
05:14:04.128 --> 05:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
and vegetables and
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um to some extent I see it as symbolic
 
05:14:08.530 --> 05:14:08.540 align:start position:0%
or educational
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it's something it's it's a
 
05:14:13.390 --> 05:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
small amount of money
 
05:14:16.010 --> 05:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something we should
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
encourage so I'm going to vote against
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
itl and I hope that we'll get to vote
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.850 --> 05:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um I apologize but
 
05:14:28.128 --> 05:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
one other point I agree we do want to
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
make sure that people get fresh fruits
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
and vegetables there's actually a a
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
program where we're able to get seeds
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Agriculture and
 
05:14:37.610 --> 05:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody on this committee
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
will help share that to families because
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
they can get seed packets so they can
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
grow their own garden in a little window
 
05:14:45.170 --> 05:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
box even if you just repurpose your five
 
05:14:47.650 --> 05:14:47.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar egg carton
 
05:14:50.330 --> 05:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
um because I'm a fan of public libraries
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
and also because my wife works at a
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
public a small Public Library
 
05:14:59.690 --> 05:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I think I I would just like to say
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
that also a lot of libraries are now
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
um providing seeds for people and our
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
local library in Keene is also providing
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
all kinds of tools so you can go garden
 
05:15:11.330 --> 05:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:15:11.340 --> 05:15:12.128 align:start position:0%
and um
and

05:15:12.128 --> 05:15:12.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:15.170 --> 05:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
education as well about gardening so I
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
think those go hand in hand I think we
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
should pass the bill and celebrate that
 
05:15:21.050 --> 05:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
libraries and other people are giving
 
05:15:23.448 --> 05:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
out seeds
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:31.128 --> 05:15:31.138 align:start position:0%
okay I'll ask the clerk to call the roll
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
motion is itl on 574.
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%

no
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't
 
05:16:19.128 --> 05:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.250 --> 05:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham no
 
05:16:24.970 --> 05:16:24.980 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro no
 
05:16:28.490 --> 05:16:28.500 align:start position:0%

representative Palmer no

05:16:44.810 --> 05:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
10 to 10.
 
05:16:46.250 --> 05:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
is there another motion that someone
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
wishes to make representative Weber I
 
05:16:51.170 --> 05:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
move out to pass
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
motion's been made ought to pass is
 
05:16:56.530 --> 05:16:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make the notion the
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
mention that because we don't the word
 
05:17:04.610 --> 05:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
Farm Stand is already included in the
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
def Federal definition of the program so
 
05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
we know they can be done but I
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely take representative Leon's
 
05:17:14.570 --> 05:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
point that it would be better to have
 
05:17:17.930 --> 05:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
the words or Farm stands in the bill so
 
05:17:21.310 --> 05:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
in the event that I am writing a report
 
05:17:23.930 --> 05:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
for a committee that perhaps does not
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would be writing it ought to pass with
 
05:17:30.288 --> 05:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
an amendment to be numbered later which
 
05:17:31.970 --> 05:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
would include the Farm Stand language
 
05:17:34.850 --> 05:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
which makes the beer Bill clearer and I
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure everybody knew
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
that up front that I was not pulling off
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
pulling a fast one my intent is entirely
 
05:17:42.000 --> 05:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
pulling a fast one my intent is entirely
to

05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:17:47.448 --> 05:17:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
05:17:52.730 --> 05:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:17:52.740 --> 05:17:54.288 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

05:17:54.288 --> 05:17:54.298 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:17:56.810 --> 05:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting against the ought to
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
pass motion
 
05:18:01.550 --> 05:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I I can understand the point that
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount of money
 
05:18:03.718 --> 05:18:04.430 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount of money
um

05:18:04.430 --> 05:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:07.010 --> 05:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know and you know it may give some
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
benefit to a small amount of people but
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
I think that the number of people is
 
05:18:13.368 --> 05:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
very small and I think that the
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
utilization is not guaranteed especially
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
if transportation is an issue and these
 
05:18:20.690 --> 05:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
people are getting farm fresh vegetables
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the supermarkets that they go to
 
05:18:24.128 --> 05:18:24.138 align:start position:0%
anyway there are local
 
05:18:26.930 --> 05:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
supermarket Local Foods in our
 
05:18:26.940 --> 05:18:28.330 align:start position:0%
supermarket Local Foods in our
supermarkets

05:18:28.330 --> 05:18:28.340 align:start position:0%
supermarkets
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing is this is all coming
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers and we're going to have a
 
05:18:36.590 --> 05:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget that's you know a lot of money
 
05:18:39.170 --> 05:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
and the the more that we can Whittle
 
05:18:41.690 --> 05:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
that down and reduce the burden on our
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers I think the better I think
 
05:18:46.190 --> 05:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
everyone is suffering right now in this
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
economy and we need to look at the big
 
05:18:50.570 --> 05:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
picture and see is is this really a
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
benefit that's going to actually help
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
enough people I think that all people
 
05:18:57.050 --> 05:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
who are taxpayers in the state can
 
05:18:58.850 --> 05:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
benefit from not paying as much out of
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
their pocket
 
05:19:04.850 --> 05:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.650 --> 05:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
being none I will ask the clerk to
 
05:19:09.410 --> 05:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
follow all motion is ought to pass on
 
05:19:09.420 --> 05:19:11.570 align:start position:0%
follow all motion is ought to pass on
574.

05:19:11.570 --> 05:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
574.

05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:20:02.760 --> 05:20:04.270 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
yes

05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:20:08.448 --> 05:20:08.458 align:start position:0%
representative Gary Merchant yes sorry
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
about that representative Murphy yes
 
05:20:14.448 --> 05:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
05:20:14.458 --> 05:20:15.890 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
yes

05:20:15.890 --> 05:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative page yes
 
05:20:24.050 --> 05:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
and representative McDonald no
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other motions to be
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.550 --> 05:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
I think if I understand the committee
 
05:20:45.288 --> 05:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
and what are all saying the intent is
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
the policy itself we support
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about the
 
05:20:52.490 --> 05:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it
 
05:20:55.010 --> 05:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
I don't like to have more bills retained
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
because it just needs more work for the
 
05:20:58.850 --> 05:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
committee how are they given the fact
 
05:21:01.070 --> 05:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
that nutrition is important
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
to go to youngsters is dealing with WIC
 
05:21:07.490 --> 05:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
women and infants and children
 
05:21:09.948 --> 05:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
I'd like to retain the bill but I'm
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
leery of it because we have enough bills
 
05:21:13.730 --> 05:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
already retained so I'm looking around
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
my committee peers and saying we retain
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
it that also means we have additional
 
05:21:17.940 --> 05:21:22.368 align:start position:0%
it that also means we have additional
workload

05:21:22.368 --> 05:21:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.810 --> 05:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion to retain it
 
05:21:31.550 --> 05:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant moves to retain
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:21:36.250 --> 05:21:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:39.770 --> 05:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
who seconded it or a tie you can call it
 
05:21:42.288 --> 05:21:42.298 align:start position:0%
okay representative McKay we'll we'll
 
05:21:44.330 --> 05:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
let you second it
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
motion representative Merchant more than
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
you have already or
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think I pretty much covered it all
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
the intent is well done I think we have
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
to work through some of the logistics of
 
05:22:00.350 --> 05:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
it so therefore that's why I wanted to
 
05:22:02.330 --> 05:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
05:22:04.250 --> 05:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully other people can see
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
the merits of that as well
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative Weber
 
05:22:11.810 --> 05:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'm very much in two minds about
 
05:22:11.820 --> 05:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
I'm very much in two minds about
retention

05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
retention
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
first of all it loses us an entire
 
05:22:15.958 --> 05:22:17.810 align:start position:0%
first of all it loses us an entire
season

05:22:17.810 --> 05:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
season
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a very small
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
amount of money for a very small amount
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
of people but it makes a very large
 
05:22:29.690 --> 05:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.208 --> 05:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
if I force us into if I vote to force us
 
05:22:35.218 --> 05:22:36.970 align:start position:0%
if I force us into if I vote to force us
into

05:22:36.970 --> 05:22:36.980 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:22:40.550 --> 05:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
voting this term then there is the
 
05:22:42.288 --> 05:22:42.298 align:start position:0%
possibility the bill can't come back
 
05:22:43.490 --> 05:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
next term
 
05:22:43.500 --> 05:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
next term
but

05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:48.110 --> 05:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
I have to say
 
05:22:50.810 --> 05:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'm really leaning towards let's get
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
this out to the house and vote on it one
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
way or another because otherwise we are
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
currently as a committee descending into
 
05:23:01.550 --> 05:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
the never-ending story and if we retain
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
every bill that is going to come 10 to
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
10 in this committee
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh our summer and our fall is going to
 
05:23:13.570 --> 05:23:13.580 align:start position:0%
be very difficult but we're also
 
05:23:18.288 --> 05:23:18.298 align:start position:0%
uh not doing the job the tough job that
 
05:23:20.270 --> 05:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
we were elected to do for our
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
constituents so
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm leaning against
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
retention but could be convinced
 
05:23:33.128 --> 05:23:33.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
I actually have a question so if the
 
05:23:39.530 --> 05:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry thank you Mr
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
chairman so if the bills 10 to 10 it
 
05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
goes to the house for am I correct If It
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately has no recommendation it goes
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
to the house floor without a
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation yeah thank you and and
 
05:23:51.368 --> 05:23:51.378 align:start position:0%
there is a written report
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
on both sides
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative I guess I'd like to see
 
05:24:01.490 --> 05:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.650 --> 05:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
05:24:06.650 --> 05:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
05:24:06.660 --> 05:24:07.550 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
um

05:24:07.550 --> 05:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:10.010 --> 05:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
we grow most of our own food at least in
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
the warm months but every once in a
 
05:24:15.128 --> 05:24:15.138 align:start position:0%
while I'm at the farmers market and I um
 
05:24:19.490 --> 05:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
go egad it is so expensive to show up
 
05:24:21.170 --> 05:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
here I mean
 
05:24:24.050 --> 05:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
and then I think about the people who
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
are selling their food who got up at
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the morning and have
 
05:24:29.628 --> 05:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
been picking that food in the fields and
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
might leave the farmer's market with a
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
lot of their food unsold so I think it's
 
05:24:34.320 --> 05:24:35.390 align:start position:0%
lot of their food unsold so I think it's
um

05:24:35.390 --> 05:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
really difficult to be a small farmer in
 
05:24:40.490 --> 05:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that this bill
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
also supports small farmers once again I
 
05:24:47.330 --> 05:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't want to be hyperbolic so it's not
 
05:24:50.050 --> 05:24:50.060 align:start position:0%
going to be that much of a support
 
05:24:54.410 --> 05:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
but it it is also supporting people who
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
are providing local
 
05:24:59.570 --> 05:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
frequently organic food which is an
 
05:25:01.850 --> 05:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult thing to do so I
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
want to support those people as well and
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
as representative Weber said if we
 
05:25:12.050 --> 05:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
retain it we lose the year of people
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
being able to do this I think we had a
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
similar or same bill last year and we
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
didn't pass it so that we already we
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
already in a sense retained it although
 
05:25:25.730 --> 05:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
we didn't work on it so I would vote
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
against retention sometimes a feel-good
 
05:25:31.610 --> 05:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill is a feel-good bill and it makes
 
05:25:33.590 --> 05:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
you feel good and it does some good and
 
05:25:36.288 --> 05:25:36.298 align:start position:0%
if people don't utilize it
 
05:25:39.410 --> 05:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
then it will it won't be utilized and
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
the money won't be spent
 
05:25:42.120 --> 05:25:44.810 align:start position:0%
the money won't be spent
yes

05:25:44.810 --> 05:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.850 --> 05:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald I'm against
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill I feel like we've
 
05:25:50.930 --> 05:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
already voted on it twice let it go to
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
the the Full House and just be done with
 
05:25:55.070 --> 05:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
it uh retaining it is just kicking the
 
05:25:56.690 --> 05:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
can down the road and I don't think
 
05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
that's fair to anybody thank you
 
05:26:01.730 --> 05:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
another discussion representative Leon
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman this bill was
 
05:26:05.390 --> 05:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
heard in its twin form in the Senate
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
today in Senate Bill 233 so if it
 
05:26:10.010 --> 05:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
survives the Senate we'll be seeing it
 
05:26:11.930 --> 05:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
either way
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just do want to speak to the
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
idea of supporting the small farmers I
 
05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to get fully briefed on it
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
but out in California where all the good
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
strawberries are grown there's a process
 
05:26:24.050 --> 05:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
to get that into it oh yes Babalu
 
05:26:25.330 --> 05:26:25.340 align:start position:0%
they're the best
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's a process of getting that to
 
05:26:29.448 --> 05:26:29.458 align:start position:0%
people that need it and I'd like to see
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
us take more of that path but it's a lot
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
more work than I've been able to
 
05:26:34.850 --> 05:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
undertake so far so I would look for
 
05:26:36.650 --> 05:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
partners on that
 
05:26:38.330 --> 05:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri
 
05:26:40.610 --> 05:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I know we talked about before about
 
05:26:43.368 --> 05:26:43.378 align:start position:0%
even like transportation and a lot of
 
05:26:45.890 --> 05:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
farmers markets are you know more Rural
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our under-resourced
 
05:26:50.810 --> 05:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
families are in urban areas so and with
 
05:26:54.650 --> 05:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
gas prices and increasing is I mean we
 
05:26:56.690 --> 05:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
say thirty dollars but then the cost of
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
getting to these farmers markets and
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
then as it was mentioned the cost of the
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
produce at these farmers markets is
 
05:27:05.040 --> 05:27:06.410 align:start position:0%
produce at these farmers markets is
significant

05:27:06.410 --> 05:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so I I just think there's more
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
involved in it than Farmers providing
 
05:27:14.208 --> 05:27:14.218 align:start position:0%
local farmers providing Goods there's
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
the transportation issues of getting to
 
05:27:19.730 --> 05:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
these places as well that I've heard one
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
a few people mention but like that's a
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
big thing so
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
um and who knows gas prices could even
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
continue to increase and make it almost
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
impossible for our under-resourced
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
families to get there
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative I
 
05:27:37.330 --> 05:27:37.340 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give the big city
 
05:27:40.368 --> 05:27:40.378 align:start position:0%
perspective of Nashua where the farmers
 
05:27:42.288 --> 05:27:42.298 align:start position:0%
markets right downtown and within
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
walking distance of thousands of people
 
05:27:48.530 --> 05:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
I know but anybody on that side before I
 
05:27:49.970 --> 05:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
go back to the site
 
05:27:52.368 --> 05:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nagel I just did a
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
Google um for allowed to do that but
 
05:27:56.288 --> 05:27:56.298 align:start position:0%
there's farmers markets in Manchester
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
Bedford Derry because I have the same
 
05:28:00.410 --> 05:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
concern you had
 
05:28:02.690 --> 05:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
but like when I grew up the farmers went
 
05:28:04.970 --> 05:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
to the city we had a great indoor Polish
 
05:28:08.810 --> 05:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
market in downtown Buffalo and yeah but
 
05:28:10.910 --> 05:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of that that issue seems
 
05:28:12.890 --> 05:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
to be a problem for me
 
05:28:12.900 --> 05:28:14.270 align:start position:0%
to be a problem for me
okay

05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
05:28:19.730 --> 05:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
um motion's been made and seconded to
 
05:28:21.900 --> 05:28:22.970 align:start position:0%
um motion's been made and seconded to
retain

05:28:22.970 --> 05:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
retain
 
05:28:25.010 --> 05:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing conflicting opinions about
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether we should do that but I guess
 
05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
we'll call the roll and see where we end
 
05:28:27.600 --> 05:28:31.368 align:start position:0%
we'll call the roll and see where we end
up

05:28:31.368 --> 05:28:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:33.650 --> 05:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative land
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
sorry were you trying to get recognized
 
05:28:37.850 --> 05:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
or was there a point of order I was
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
after the discussion listening to the
 
05:28:42.170 --> 05:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
committee I was willing to read
 
05:28:44.448 --> 05:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
retract my motion if uh representative
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.240 --> 05:28:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

05:28:49.550 --> 05:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:28:51.730 --> 05:28:51.740 align:start position:0%

representative McKay
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the Motions were drawn
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to send 574 to
 
05:29:01.490 --> 05:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
the floor with no recommendation is that
 
05:29:05.208 --> 05:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee
 
05:29:05.218 --> 05:29:08.770 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee
okay

05:29:08.770 --> 05:29:08.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.780 --> 05:29:10.868 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:14.030 --> 05:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was sending it as
 
05:29:14.040 --> 05:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was sending it as
amended

05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.650 --> 05:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
sorry what what I will write as as the
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I will let the clerk know that I'll
 
05:29:29.208 --> 05:29:29.218 align:start position:0%
write the report on the the statement we
 
05:29:31.010 --> 05:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
call them in favor of
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:29:38.930 --> 05:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
um I I will as I stated write it ought
 
05:29:41.330 --> 05:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
to pass with an amendment which doesn't
 
05:29:44.090 --> 05:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
actually change the meaning of the bill
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
at all it just makes clear that a piece
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the federal legislation
 
05:29:52.550 --> 05:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh which is or Farm stands gets put in
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and that's what the amendment
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
will do and my report will specifically
 
05:29:58.550 --> 05:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
say that that's what the amendment does
 
05:30:01.690 --> 05:30:01.700 align:start position:0%
but we having not
 
05:30:04.550 --> 05:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
achieved a consent none of these things
 
05:30:07.250 --> 05:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
have been adopted I mean itl hasn't been
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
adopted and OTP or otpa hasn't been
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
adopted so it's just a matter of
 
05:30:14.990 --> 05:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
putting two statements in the calendar
 
05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
and letting the House vote
 
05:30:18.060 --> 05:30:19.310 align:start position:0%
and letting the House vote
okay

05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:30:22.730 --> 05:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.490 --> 05:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay uh so this this will go to the
 
05:30:27.530 --> 05:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
floor with no recommendation
 
05:30:29.570 --> 05:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
our next build for us to consider is
 
05:30:33.010 --> 05:30:33.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 565 FNA
 
05:30:35.690 --> 05:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
which is relative to expanding Medicaid
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
to include certain postpartum Healthcare
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
Services representative Leon uh thank
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I move an Expedia to
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 565 FNA
 
05:30:49.390 --> 05:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second oh second
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman seconds
 
05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative land do you want to speak
 
05:30:54.410 --> 05:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you Mr
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
chairman right now we're in very
 
05:30:58.970 --> 05:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
challenging times around Medicaid
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion the expiration of the
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
public health emergency and all of those
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
implications over the next nine months
 
05:31:08.330 --> 05:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
we are going to have tens of thousands
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
of people and notified about the
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
necessity of continuing benefits and
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
there'll be major shocks to the Health
 
05:31:14.890 --> 05:31:14.900 align:start position:0%
Care System
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:31:20.208 --> 05:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
right now it's just a matter of
 
05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the benefits that we have
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
while we're going through such a major
 
05:31:27.470 --> 05:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
change just does not seem wise to me at
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
this point and therefore that's why I
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:37.010 --> 05:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
any other discussion yes representative
 
05:31:40.550 --> 05:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
I oppose an expedient to legislate this
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
is giving
 
05:31:42.000 --> 05:31:43.070 align:start position:0%
is giving
uh

05:31:43.070 --> 05:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:46.550 --> 05:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
women a good start with their babies and
 
05:31:48.770 --> 05:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
it costs us very little money and it's
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
federally matched to extend benefits
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
from two months to 12 months if you want
 
05:31:57.350 --> 05:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
to build a healthy Society if you want
 
05:32:00.410 --> 05:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
to cut down on drug abuse abuse all
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of things you start with building
 
05:32:05.208 --> 05:32:05.218 align:start position:0%
healthy children I'm so in favor of this
 
05:32:05.218 --> 05:32:06.730 align:start position:0%
healthy children I'm so in favor of this
bill

05:32:06.730 --> 05:32:06.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:32:09.590 --> 05:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
05:32:09.600 --> 05:32:10.850 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
chairman

05:32:10.850 --> 05:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:32:10.860 --> 05:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
this bill was defeated the house bill
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
last year was defeated
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and voted against in this committee but
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
there was a Senate bill that an Omnibus
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that included this that was
 
05:32:28.850 --> 05:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
passed and when it went to a committee
 
05:32:30.288 --> 05:32:30.298 align:start position:0%
of conference while people didn't
 
05:32:32.930 --> 05:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
disagree about this part of the bill
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
they did disagree about other things and
 
05:32:36.650 --> 05:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
it never made it through the committee
 
05:32:39.530 --> 05:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
of conference so this just barely didn't
 
05:32:42.288 --> 05:32:42.298 align:start position:0%
pass last year the idea for this bill
 
05:32:44.690 --> 05:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
did not come from the representative who
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
presented it it's not something you know
 
05:32:50.150 --> 05:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't her brainchild this is a bill
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
that is an option that is created by the
 
05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
and it's specifically to deal with the
 
05:33:00.770 --> 05:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
high rates of maternal mortality in this
 
05:33:00.780 --> 05:33:01.930 align:start position:0%
high rates of maternal mortality in this
country

05:33:01.930 --> 05:33:01.940 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
the most recent statistics of the United
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
States are that 17 they're 17.4 deaths
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
per 100 000 live births and that is well
 
05:33:13.080 --> 05:33:14.208 align:start position:0%
per 100 000 live births and that is well
above

05:33:14.208 --> 05:33:14.218 align:start position:0%
above
 
05:33:16.730 --> 05:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
um most of the other wealthy countries
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the um in the world including Poland
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
which has a rate of 1.1
 
05:33:23.458 --> 05:33:24.170 align:start position:0%
which has a rate of 1.1
um

05:33:24.170 --> 05:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:27.770 --> 05:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Czech Republic that is 4.5 so it is
 
05:33:30.410 --> 05:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
a recognized problem that we are trying
 
05:33:32.750 --> 05:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
to solve that the country is trying to
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
solve so we shouldn't think of it as
 
05:33:38.448 --> 05:33:38.458 align:start position:0%
just the New Hampshire solution
 
05:33:38.458 --> 05:33:44.510 align:start position:0%
just the New Hampshire solution
um

05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:46.550 --> 05:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have heard that two months of
 
05:33:49.570 --> 05:33:49.580 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage
 
05:33:52.550 --> 05:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
does not catch a lot of problems that
 
05:33:54.010 --> 05:33:54.020 align:start position:0%
happen Post
 
05:33:56.448 --> 05:33:56.458 align:start position:0%
delivery of a child and that included
 
05:33:59.448 --> 05:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
cardiac problems and it included mental
 
05:34:01.730 --> 05:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
health problems postpartum depression it
 
05:34:04.850 --> 05:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
included the sequelae of substance
 
05:34:08.690 --> 05:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
misuse and because we got a report about
 
05:34:12.050 --> 05:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality related to the other
 
05:34:14.650 --> 05:34:14.660 align:start position:0%
bill on maternal mortality
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
if one looks in there you can see at one
 
05:34:21.170 --> 05:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
point there were maternal mortalities in
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
and um about 40 percent of those
 
05:34:29.690 --> 05:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
maternal mortalities came between
 
05:34:33.948 --> 05:34:33.958 align:start position:0%
I think it was 43 days and one year so a
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the deaths that we have
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
experienced in New Hampshire come Beyond
 
05:34:39.170 --> 05:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
two months
 
05:34:41.330 --> 05:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
the last point that I want to make is
 
05:34:41.340 --> 05:34:45.530 align:start position:0%
the last point that I want to make is
that

05:34:45.530 --> 05:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:45.540 --> 05:34:47.690 align:start position:0%
 
currently

05:34:47.690 --> 05:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
we cut off
 
05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
um postpartum benefits for two months
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
not for everybody who is on Medicaid and
 
05:34:58.490 --> 05:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
gives birth but just for a portion of
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
the people there are a portion of the
 
05:35:04.490 --> 05:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
people who make under under 133 percent
 
05:35:07.610 --> 05:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
of the federal poverty level that come
 
05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
two months after their birth they will
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be um eligible for
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
the granite Advantage Health Care
 
05:35:18.770 --> 05:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
Program expanded Medicaid and they will
 
05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
continue to have Medicaid it's the
 
05:35:25.128 --> 05:35:25.138 align:start position:0%
people who have Medicaid by virtue of
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were pregnant and
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
they have to be under 196 percent of the
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level so it's only a
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
portion of people that will be expanding
 
05:35:36.050 --> 05:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
postpartum benefits for
 
05:35:36.060 --> 05:35:37.310 align:start position:0%
postpartum benefits for
and

05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:37.320 --> 05:35:39.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:41.948 --> 05:35:41.958 align:start position:0%
someone who makes just a little bit over
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
133 percent of the federal poverty level
 
05:35:46.810 --> 05:35:46.820 align:start position:0%
which is 19
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
391 dollars
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
um for two people I don't know if you
 
05:35:52.970 --> 05:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
counted as two people once they have the
 
05:35:52.980 --> 05:35:53.868 align:start position:0%
counted as two people once they have the
baby

05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
baby
 
05:35:56.448 --> 05:35:56.458 align:start position:0%
um it's twenty six thousand dollars so
 
05:35:58.970 --> 05:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
these people who will have their
 
05:36:02.570 --> 05:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid cut off postpartum or people
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
who are working at very low wage jobs
 
05:36:08.510 --> 05:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
very likely to not have any health care
 
05:36:11.208 --> 05:36:11.218 align:start position:0%
benefits so I think we are taking
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
low-income people people who are
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people who are vulnerable to
 
05:36:18.250 --> 05:36:18.260 align:start position:0%
these um
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality and maternal medical
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
problems and we're turning them out in
 
05:36:26.990 --> 05:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
the cold and I think that um I I agree
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the representative who said we're
 
05:36:31.490 --> 05:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of things in terms of
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid a lot of changes and a lot of
 
05:36:33.780 --> 05:36:35.150 align:start position:0%
Medicaid a lot of changes and a lot of
unknowns

05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
unknowns
 
05:36:37.368 --> 05:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
um but I think this is just
 
05:36:37.378 --> 05:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
um but I think this is just
um

05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:40.010 --> 05:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
really good
 
05:36:40.020 --> 05:36:41.570 align:start position:0%
really good
child

05:36:41.570 --> 05:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:36:41.580 --> 05:36:43.010 align:start position:0%
child
family

05:36:43.010 --> 05:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
Health Care policy and that is the job
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
of our committee to increase access to
 
05:36:51.170 --> 05:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
health care I mean at least that's the
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
mission that I see for our committee so
 
05:36:56.288 --> 05:36:56.298 align:start position:0%
this is incremental it's small
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
but it just makes total sense to me and
 
05:37:02.690 --> 05:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
so I would vote against itl and
 
05:37:06.288 --> 05:37:06.298 align:start position:0%
hopefully vote for autopests
 
05:37:08.810 --> 05:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
05:37:08.820 --> 05:37:10.910 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I would disagree with the last
 
05:37:12.480 --> 05:37:13.550 align:start position:0%
um I would disagree with the last
statement

05:37:13.550 --> 05:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
statement
 
05:37:17.208 --> 05:37:17.218 align:start position:0%
um I don't well I agree that we as a
 
05:37:19.250 --> 05:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee can help improve access to
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
health care but
 
05:37:22.810 --> 05:37:22.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that necessarily means
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know subsidizing it with taxpayer
 
05:37:27.650 --> 05:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
money and
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know the broader we make eligibility
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid the more people are on
 
05:37:34.490 --> 05:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eventually everyone will be
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid and then we have
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care and I I think we
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
need to draw a hard line somewhere and
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
right now there's no eligibility
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
requirement to continue this benefit
 
05:37:50.448 --> 05:37:50.458 align:start position:0%
past two months postpartum as the bill
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
is written and someone could be making
 
05:37:55.070 --> 05:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know plenty of money once they go
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
back to work and still taxpayers are
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
footing their medical bills
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
in addition I don't think that there is
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
this extremely high need as we've only
 
05:38:07.270 --> 05:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
had nine
 
05:38:10.368 --> 05:38:10.378 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths as we heard from one of
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
the person people testifying on this
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill and most of those deaths were
 
05:38:19.250 --> 05:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
attributed to drug overdose so it it's I
 
05:38:21.770 --> 05:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this is a wise way to
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
spend taxpayer money just because the
 
05:38:25.368 --> 05:38:25.378 align:start position:0%
federal government is matching doesn't
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
mean that we have to jump in and join
 
05:38:28.798 --> 05:38:29.690 align:start position:0%
mean that we have to jump in and join
um

05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:31.788 --> 05:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:38:34.250 --> 05:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire you know we we are
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible and I think that we
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
should continue that and vote itl on
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:38:44.690 --> 05:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman I just have
 
05:38:48.890 --> 05:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
a question I can't find my notes on this
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill was there uh we had a dollar figure
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.200 --> 05:39:10.128 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:39:10.128 --> 05:39:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
we did not have a dollar amount it says
 
05:39:14.810 --> 05:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
due to time constraints the office of
 
05:39:17.628 --> 05:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
the LBA is unable to provide a fiscal
 
05:39:19.550 --> 05:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
note for this bill is introduced at this
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
time so unless that's changed and we
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
haven't been notified it's it's an
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
unknown representative nabel um do we
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a number of people
 
05:39:31.070 --> 05:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that was involved is that in the bill
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I left my notes somewhere
 
05:39:37.850 --> 05:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
I I believe there was some talk about
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
that from the testimony but I I do not
 
05:39:43.010 --> 05:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
have those figures and I'm not sure that
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's what those Figures were
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative you had your hand up or
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually wanted to make some
 
05:39:51.530 --> 05:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
other points
 
05:39:54.890 --> 05:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I I will rummage through my stuff but
 
05:39:59.150 --> 05:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
I will make the first point is that uh
 
05:40:01.610 --> 05:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
we should be acting on good health
 
05:40:01.620 --> 05:40:02.868 align:start position:0%
we should be acting on good health
policy

05:40:02.868 --> 05:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:40:06.170 --> 05:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
and leaving to the finance committee
 
05:40:08.448 --> 05:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
because this is also an early bill I
 
05:40:08.458 --> 05:40:09.288 align:start position:0%
because this is also an early bill I
believe

05:40:09.288 --> 05:40:09.298 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:40:09.298 --> 05:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
believe
uh

05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes uh the question of whether the funds
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
are available and how they relate to the
 
05:40:21.410 --> 05:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
need of all the other things we have
 
05:40:23.090 --> 05:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
need of
 
05:40:23.100 --> 05:40:24.350 align:start position:0%
need of
um

05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:27.770 --> 05:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
the other points I wanted to make on my
 
05:40:30.530 --> 05:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
own bat were
 
05:40:30.540 --> 05:40:31.190 align:start position:0%
own bat were
um

05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:37.128 --> 05:40:37.138 align:start position:0%
only a few people die
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that's bad enough
 
05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people have as we heard in
 
05:40:43.680 --> 05:40:44.990 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people have as we heard in
testimony

05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:40:49.550 --> 05:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh severe consequences attendant on
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
having given birth that only show up
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
after two months
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
and those problems as we know in many
 
05:41:00.650 --> 05:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
many contexts
 
05:41:04.850 --> 05:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
if left untreated are going to cost a
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
lot more to treat
 
05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
when we get to the point where somebody
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
winds up in an emergency room then they
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
are if they were treated with routine
 
05:41:20.690 --> 05:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
well-mom and well baby care
 
05:41:25.690 --> 05:41:25.700 align:start position:0%
prior to becoming an acute episode so
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
that was my low-lying fruit and I will
 
05:41:30.830 --> 05:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
try and see if I can find the other
 
05:41:34.250 --> 05:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
numbers but I'm drowning in paper here
 
05:41:34.260 --> 05:41:35.448 align:start position:0%
numbers but I'm drowning in paper here
so

05:41:35.448 --> 05:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:35.458 --> 05:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:41:36.470 --> 05:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:39.530 --> 05:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.650 --> 05:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
sort of enforce what representative
 
05:41:47.930 --> 05:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
Weber said I don't think this as so much
 
05:41:50.448 --> 05:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
as an expense as an investment
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
um we have a tendency sometimes be very
 
05:41:52.020 --> 05:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
um we have a tendency sometimes be very
short-sighted

05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
short-sighted
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the consequence comes back to Midas
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
and when you're dealing with children
 
05:41:58.970 --> 05:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
and health
 
05:42:01.250 --> 05:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to spend a dollar on
 
05:42:01.260 --> 05:42:02.448 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to spend a dollar on
prevention

05:42:02.448 --> 05:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
05:42:04.910 --> 05:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
then it's 100 on Curative
 
05:42:06.770 --> 05:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
and this bill basically is trying to
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
identify women as well as infants
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
and get to them early enough to have an
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
intervention to make it as cost
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
effective as possible from a policy
 
05:42:20.330 --> 05:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
point of view it's good health policy as
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
well as a fiscal policy but to
 
05:42:23.930 --> 05:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said it's actually
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
a finance to determine but I see this
 
05:42:28.550 --> 05:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
more as an investment versus an expense
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
number two talking about representative
 
05:42:33.170 --> 05:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
Leon I cannot think of it any better
 
05:42:33.180 --> 05:42:34.310 align:start position:0%
Leon I cannot think of it any better
time

05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
as the Department of Health Human
 
05:42:37.128 --> 05:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
Services is going through eligibility
 
05:42:40.970 --> 05:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
reviews then to put this into the same
 
05:42:43.250 --> 05:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
review process and saying the eligible
 
05:42:44.990 --> 05:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
so we're not adding the workload we're
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
just making it part of the review
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
process they're going through today so I
 
05:42:49.250 --> 05:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be a
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
burdensome to the department because
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to go through this
 
05:42:56.590 --> 05:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon and then
 
05:43:00.170 --> 05:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
um we do look back to some of the things
 
05:43:05.208 --> 05:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
that were discussed last year when a
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
very similar bill came by there was a
 
05:43:08.690 --> 05:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion on that testimony
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
about if New Hampshire could have
 
05:43:12.050 --> 05:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
certain limits like keeping the income
 
05:43:13.970 --> 05:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
limit that allows you to qualify while
 
05:43:16.310 --> 05:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're pregnant during that next private
 
05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but the federal government
 
05:43:21.050 --> 05:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
will not allow us to do that if we sign
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
on I know when I shared my personal
 
05:43:27.050 --> 05:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
experience it became a little bit of uh
 
05:43:29.208 --> 05:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
just one case but we're looking at a lot
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
of these just one case if we can save
 
05:43:32.990 --> 05:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
just one woman
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
or else we also need to look at some of
 
05:43:37.070 --> 05:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
those other consequences that do come
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
from it when I was pregnant with my
 
05:43:41.090 --> 05:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
first child I was laid off because 95 of
 
05:43:42.890 --> 05:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
my company was late my department was
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
laid off because we were acquired so had
 
05:43:47.208 --> 05:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
I been unmarried or if my husband had
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
not been working I would have qualified
 
05:43:51.410 --> 05:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
for benefits and then I went back to
 
05:43:53.448 --> 05:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
work I had another closely spaced
 
05:43:55.490 --> 05:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and it may have made a lot of
 
05:43:59.090 --> 05:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
sense for me to be saving it to space my
 
05:44:01.490 --> 05:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
pregnancies closer in order to save some
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
money I know there's a large cost to
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
raise a child to adulthood but when
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're able to consolidate and keep
 
05:44:08.930 --> 05:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
things closer there are some some
 
05:44:10.970 --> 05:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
economies of scale of Health having
 
05:44:13.010 --> 05:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
children closer however the World Health
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
Organization highly discourages
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancies that are more than two to
 
05:44:18.890 --> 05:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
three years apart so I am also very
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about the health risks of
 
05:44:24.048 --> 05:44:24.058 align:start position:0%
women who are in that margin in between
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
where they can where they're getting or
 
05:44:29.570 --> 05:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
can afford very high quality care and
 
05:44:31.490 --> 05:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
then choosing to make economic choices
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
to tie themselves back in or to get
 
05:44:37.310 --> 05:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant again faster so that they can
 
05:44:38.750 --> 05:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
maintain that Health Care coverage
 
05:44:40.368 --> 05:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
because I know today there are young
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
people that are not going to hire higher
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
employment and better opportunities
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to go off of
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that they got during covid and
 
05:44:50.090 --> 05:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues that's
 
05:44:52.490 --> 05:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
impacting our employment Market I know
 
05:44:53.810 --> 05:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
that people are smart and they follow
 
05:44:56.330 --> 05:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
incentives and I truly do see that as a
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
risk for some of these several hundred
 
05:44:59.930 --> 05:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
women who are here and that has health
 
05:45:02.330 --> 05:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
risks too because tightly spaced
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
pregnancies increase the Opera increase
 
05:45:07.310 --> 05:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
the chance of adverse health effects in
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Weber and then
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'll come over here
 
05:45:15.120 --> 05:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
I'll come over here
um

05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
the memorandum that we got from Ms Dyer
 
05:45:22.310 --> 05:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
the committee researcher uh was based on
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
last year's figures and said that the uh
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
Department had estimated an annual
 
05:45:28.670 --> 05:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
increase in state general funds
 
05:45:31.368 --> 05:45:31.378 align:start position:0%
expenditures between 200
 
05:45:33.470 --> 05:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
000 and a million dollars per year so
 
05:45:33.480 --> 05:45:35.208 align:start position:0%
000 and a million dollars per year so
that's

05:45:35.208 --> 05:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:45:37.368 --> 05:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
I know that's a big number but I think
 
05:45:39.170 --> 05:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
in the course of the grand scheme of
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
things it's a very small number to pay
 
05:45:41.160 --> 05:45:42.190 align:start position:0%
things it's a very small number to pay
for

05:45:42.190 --> 05:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
the infant a good start in life and the
 
05:45:54.590 --> 05:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
mom the good health to go forward in
 
05:45:59.690 --> 05:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
life and I would take exception to the
 
05:46:04.190 --> 05:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
idea that somebody incurs the expense of
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
raising a child for 18 years because
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
they want to stay on Medicaid for
 
05:46:14.810 --> 05:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
another 10 months I just if somebody is
 
05:46:17.170 --> 05:46:17.180 align:start position:0%
making that balance
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a strange credulity in my case so
 
05:46:25.610 --> 05:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh that that was the money issue yes
 
05:46:27.048 --> 05:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
05:46:29.150 --> 05:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
I could talk for a long time on this
 
05:46:33.110 --> 05:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill and because it's so similar to so
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
many other bills I have a philosophical
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
disagreement with this entire idea I
 
05:46:39.650 --> 05:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
won't bore you with that one thing I
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
will say though is that something just
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
one one topic that's not being mentioned
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
here is what kind of care earlier we had
 
05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
somebody come in and talk about
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
naturopathic medicine and the
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
establishment stooge came in here and
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
told us about how terrible naturopathy
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
is and you know what are you if you're
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid are you going to get
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
naturopathic no you're not so so for me
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's like great we're signing them up
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the um the big the big corporate uh
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
grift that's in bed with the government
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
and they're going to get allopathic
 
05:47:10.970 --> 05:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
medicine they're going to get you know
 
05:47:12.410 --> 05:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
an allopathic medicine might be great if
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
you've got a broken leg but you know if
 
05:47:15.770 --> 05:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
you have chronic illness I'm a big fan
 
05:47:17.090 --> 05:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
of naturopathy and they're not going to
 
05:47:18.410 --> 05:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
get this they're not going to get that
 
05:47:20.270 --> 05:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
with this so what we're doing is we're
 
05:47:21.650 --> 05:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
just shoe warning more and more people
 
05:47:24.470 --> 05:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
into an entire medical system that I'm
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
just disgusted with so I don't I don't
 
05:47:27.650 --> 05:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
want more people in that I want to get
 
05:47:29.330 --> 05:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
people off of that thank you
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and I don't
 
05:47:35.690 --> 05:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
want to pile on any more than what has
 
05:47:38.090 --> 05:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
already been said about
 
05:47:40.368 --> 05:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
um the bills pluses and minuses but you
 
05:47:42.770 --> 05:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
know it's it's very clear I think in the
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
literature when you talk about social
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
determinants of health and preventative
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
medicine Etc
 
05:47:49.788 --> 05:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
that this sort of Bill and this sort of
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
investment has a tremendous return on
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
investment the well-being of the mother
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
the well-being of the child
 
05:48:00.170 --> 05:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
um you it's it's an exponential you know
 
05:48:02.510 --> 05:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
benefit that is gained by supporting
 
05:48:04.730 --> 05:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
them and but the point I wanted to make
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
is that this is not Universal Health
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
Care for all
 
05:48:10.490 --> 05:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
this is talking about the additional 10
 
05:48:10.500 --> 05:48:11.750 align:start position:0%
this is talking about the additional 10
months

05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
when the women are most susceptible to
 
05:48:17.930 --> 05:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression cardiac disease
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
all of the morbidity that comes with
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
delivering a child and so we're not
 
05:48:24.890 --> 05:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
talking about an extended period of time
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they're on exorbitant costs that
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
the government the state will will have
 
05:48:32.208 --> 05:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
to support when you think about a third
 
05:48:34.610 --> 05:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
of women's deaths in the postpartum area
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
is related to cardiac disease that could
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
be prevented with good care so we're
 
05:48:41.150 --> 05:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
talking about a very short period of
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
time but the period of time when they
 
05:48:46.128 --> 05:48:46.138 align:start position:0%
need it most so I would support this
 
05:48:46.138 --> 05:48:47.690 align:start position:0%
need it most so I would support this
bill

05:48:47.690 --> 05:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:48:50.270 --> 05:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
05:48:52.128 --> 05:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:48:55.368 --> 05:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair um we had this bill and we
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
had another like it um which had to do
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
with providing uh coverage for uh legal
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
residents and I think from my
 
05:49:06.048 --> 05:49:06.058 align:start position:0%
perspective if I kind of look at those
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
bills in isolation that kind of makes
 
05:49:10.250 --> 05:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
sense because you know they are
 
05:49:12.288 --> 05:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
providing value for some of the for some
 
05:49:14.690 --> 05:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that representative uh
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
Murphy outlined but I think you know to
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
to address the concern raised by
 
05:49:22.850 --> 05:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative weberware is this good
 
05:49:25.850 --> 05:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
health care policy and I think while
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
while the intention is good the idea
 
05:49:31.730 --> 05:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
that we keep moving more and more people
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
into Medicare to to provide this I think
 
05:49:38.270 --> 05:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're just putting everything in in one
 
05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
bucket and I think there may be other
 
05:49:43.970 --> 05:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
ways that um we could be doing this it's
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
interesting that all the bills that we
 
05:49:48.650 --> 05:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
have coming before us have to do with we
 
05:49:50.208 --> 05:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
can put these people into Medicare we
 
05:49:52.490 --> 05:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
can put these people into Medicare and
 
05:49:54.770 --> 05:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
we don't really hear a lot about what
 
05:49:56.448 --> 05:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
about the exchanges and I know from
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
personal experience that I have a lot of
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues of mine who kind of fit in
 
05:50:06.350 --> 05:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
the middle between Medicare and employer
 
05:50:10.010 --> 05:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
insurance and so they're forced on to
 
05:50:11.868 --> 05:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
the exchanges and it's really
 
05:50:14.690 --> 05:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
unaffordable and but I don't really
 
05:50:17.330 --> 05:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
think it's getting any attention and the
 
05:50:18.890 --> 05:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
continued attention just seems to be
 
05:50:20.570 --> 05:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to be putting it into one
 
05:50:23.150 --> 05:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
bucket I think at some point it kind of
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
has to stop and and so I think that is
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
where it gets into is that Sound Health
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
Care policy or not and so I think we
 
05:50:33.048 --> 05:50:33.058 align:start position:0%
could continue to go down this path of
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
adding this and that and everything else
 
05:50:36.590 --> 05:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
just into the Medicare but I think we
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to be exploring other avenues and I
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
I think that we could just be keeping
 
05:50:44.570 --> 05:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
adding into the Medicaid bucket for
 
05:50:46.128 --> 05:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
forever so I'll be opposing the bill
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm hearing mention that that
 
05:50:52.610 --> 05:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
additional pregnancy would only get you
 
05:50:56.030 --> 05:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
10 months if you conceive in that last
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
month that gets you 10 months plus nine
 
05:51:00.288 --> 05:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
months of pregnancy plus another 12
 
05:51:02.690 --> 05:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
months so that's 31 more months of
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
coverage if you conceive again at the
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
end of that that year then that's 52
 
05:51:08.510 --> 05:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
months of coverage that's over four
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
years of Health Care coverage for
 
05:51:12.830 --> 05:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
spacing bursts that would otherwise be
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
desired to be more greatly spaced let's
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
say you want a family with three
 
05:51:16.440 --> 05:51:17.390 align:start position:0%
say you want a family with three
children

05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting longer there is a
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
great incentive to space them closer
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
that increases the chances of postpartum
 
05:51:27.170 --> 05:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
depression it increases the adverse
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
cardiac events for women this is getting
 
05:51:33.530 --> 05:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
incentives misaligned and it also is
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
removing more and more people from the
 
05:51:37.970 --> 05:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
marketplace which has systemic impacts
 
05:51:40.490 --> 05:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
on our Health Care system if you really
 
05:51:43.128 --> 05:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
take out that middle and have it so it's
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
all either government provided or
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
employer provided with no space in
 
05:51:48.770 --> 05:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
between and there's not enough people to
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
keep that sustainable it's going to push
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
one way or the other and that's just
 
05:51:53.448 --> 05:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
going to end up pushing more and more
 
05:51:55.010 --> 05:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
people onto Medicaid so that's why this
 
05:51:56.930 --> 05:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
is a policy issue and not just a
 
05:51:59.810 --> 05:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
spending issue
 
05:52:02.208 --> 05:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
05:52:04.070 --> 05:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
um since we've used movie references
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
earlier I I feel somewhat like Tom
 
05:52:09.288 --> 05:52:09.298 align:start position:0%
Tuttle a Tacoma on this bill I
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
um can see both sides of this very well
 
05:52:14.570 --> 05:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
from my medical perspective I've worked
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
with the Indian Health Service with
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
impoverished people I've seen the
 
05:52:21.170 --> 05:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
positive and the negative effects of
 
05:52:24.190 --> 05:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
such incentivization can do to people
 
05:52:27.048 --> 05:52:27.058 align:start position:0%
when Medicaid was originally created in
 
05:52:30.288 --> 05:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
the 1960s it was never created with the
 
05:52:32.628 --> 05:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
idea of permanent Medicaid it was
 
05:52:34.788 --> 05:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
created with the idea of helping people
 
05:52:36.650 --> 05:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
with a safety net with the idea of
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
giving them incentives to get off and
 
05:52:40.490 --> 05:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
become something more of yourself and I
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
agree with your point that um that we
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
kind of lost that and we need to get
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
that back with that said
 
05:52:47.638 --> 05:52:48.788 align:start position:0%
that back with that said
um

05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:51.410 --> 05:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
pregnancy especially single pregnancies
 
05:52:53.690 --> 05:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
and entire incredibly vulnerable period
 
05:52:55.250 --> 05:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
um my cousin since we're showing
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
personal stories as well my cousin um
 
05:53:04.610 --> 05:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
got pregnant at a young age
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
um had a child funded by Medicaid my
 
05:53:10.490 --> 05:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
cousin's doing really well for herself
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
her then child now daughter is also
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing very well for herself so she's
 
05:53:17.090 --> 05:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
very much a success story
 
05:53:20.208 --> 05:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill was not that
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
my bill was the 12 months and that and I
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
did ask them where does this 12 months
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
number come from because I think
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
because of everything
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
um representative Leon said and I've
 
05:53:33.530 --> 05:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
worked with people that basically get
 
05:53:35.330 --> 05:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
stuck on this system for a lot of
 
05:53:36.890 --> 05:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
different reasons and it's not good for
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
anybody it's not good for them it's not
 
05:53:40.430 --> 05:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
good for us
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
um but I I was struggling with the 12
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
months and I basically seemed to get a
 
05:53:47.810 --> 05:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic answer if I had my way I
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
would rewrite the bill and and change
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
that number to something other than 12.
 
05:53:55.128 --> 05:53:55.138 align:start position:0%
um and I don't have the brains to figure
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
out how to do that but I don't feel very
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the number 12 for a lot
 
05:54:00.830 --> 05:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
of reasons so
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
I basically just said a lot of nothing
 
05:54:05.090 --> 05:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm still waiting for you to help
 
05:54:07.970 --> 05:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
convince me what I should do about this
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.270 --> 05:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
05:54:17.448 --> 05:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:54:20.930 --> 05:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
I suppose many of you wonder uh where I
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
got my white hair from
 
05:54:22.920 --> 05:54:23.868 align:start position:0%
got my white hair from
uh

05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:23.878 --> 05:54:24.670 align:start position:0%
uh
the

05:54:24.670 --> 05:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:27.530 --> 05:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
patients that I've seen over the years
 
05:54:30.288 --> 05:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
with with this condition
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
are some of the most frightening people
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
to work with that I can think about
 
05:54:40.128 --> 05:54:40.138 align:start position:0%
I can think of one person who got onto a
 
05:54:43.310 --> 05:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
motorcycle going 90 miles an hour with
 
05:54:44.628 --> 05:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
05:54:44.638 --> 05:54:46.150 align:start position:0%
the baby
and

05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I was still fairly young then so
 
05:54:52.610 --> 05:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's when it started that that is not
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
only in the other part is that even
 
05:54:58.730 --> 05:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
though people are denying this they're
 
05:55:01.310 --> 05:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
talking more about money than they are
 
05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
Health well with it and that concerns me
 
05:55:07.010 --> 05:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh the dangerousness of
 
05:55:10.080 --> 05:55:11.410 align:start position:0%
uh the dangerousness of
everybody

05:55:11.410 --> 05:55:11.420 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
including the therapist
 
05:55:18.610 --> 05:55:18.620 align:start position:0%
is at stake in this kind of uh work and
 
05:55:24.128 --> 05:55:24.138 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky to be around at my age and
 
05:55:26.690 --> 05:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
contrary to some rumor that's going
 
05:55:30.288 --> 05:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
around I am not the oldest member of the
 
05:55:34.010 --> 05:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
legislature a good friend of mine is uh
 
05:55:38.208 --> 05:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think that
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
issue at all uh but that my feeling is
 
05:55:45.250 --> 05:55:45.260 align:start position:0%
that people in the mental health field
 
05:55:48.610 --> 05:55:48.620 align:start position:0%
are under a tremendous pressure
 
05:55:51.890 --> 05:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
constantly and that this is one of the
 
05:55:54.770 --> 05:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
greatest uh problems
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
to deal with and that anything that we
 
05:56:01.970 --> 05:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
can do to make this world better for
 
05:56:03.590 --> 05:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
05:56:06.048 --> 05:56:06.058 align:start position:0%
all the better thank you
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
05:56:10.010 --> 05:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
I would just say an answer to
 
05:56:14.690 --> 05:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel that I would be
 
05:56:17.930 --> 05:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
delighted to write a compromise but the
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
federal plan is a bureaucratic answer
 
05:56:23.330 --> 05:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
and it's either two months or it's 12
 
05:56:25.368 --> 05:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
months but it's not
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in between is is allowable so
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um it's for that reason and I simply
 
05:56:34.250 --> 05:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
come down on on the opposite side of
 
05:56:35.810 --> 05:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
that dilemma
 
05:56:37.850 --> 05:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative palazzov
 
05:56:42.650 --> 05:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I don't want
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh smart Investments and investments in
 
05:56:50.690 --> 05:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
postpartum health and that's why I will
 
05:56:54.530 --> 05:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
be voting against this bill because if
 
05:56:59.570 --> 05:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
we make Services free it's uh when
 
05:56:59.580 --> 05:57:01.448 align:start position:0%
we make Services free it's uh when
incentives

05:57:01.448 --> 05:57:01.458 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
are not smart and we will see over
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
utilization of some health care services
 
05:57:12.170 --> 05:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
we see we will see longer lines and we
 
05:57:13.070 --> 05:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
are already
 
05:57:16.510 --> 05:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
have shortage of some medical
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
professionals so I want smart
 
05:57:23.150 --> 05:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
Investments and this is not it thank you
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
05:57:27.048 --> 05:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I feel like since
 
05:57:32.208 --> 05:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
everybody else has spoken I need to so
 
05:57:34.490 --> 05:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
I've been advocating for medical care
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the last 20 years and so my one of
 
05:57:39.490 --> 05:57:39.500 align:start position:0%
my primary focuses has been expanding
 
05:57:43.128 --> 05:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
care to people who need it and I think
 
05:57:44.810 --> 05:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things I'm not going to
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
repeat everything everybody said but
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
um in countries that provide totally
 
05:57:50.930 --> 05:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
free care what they find is that people
 
05:57:53.990 --> 05:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't abuse it they
 
05:57:56.690 --> 05:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
um they use what they need in countries
 
05:58:00.110 --> 05:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
that don't provide care we have the huge
 
05:58:01.730 --> 05:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
problems we have which is
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
over utilization of the emergency room
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
and um and the lack of preventative care
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
that ends up costing us a lot more we
 
05:58:10.850 --> 05:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
have the ERS are backed up with
 
05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
psychiatric patients they're backed up
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
with patients who can't get into the
 
05:58:16.250 --> 05:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
hospital right now and part of that is
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
because we under invest and we haven't
 
05:58:22.010 --> 05:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
taking care of the basic problems the
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
psychiatric issues are we don't you know
 
05:58:26.448 --> 05:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
there's no place else for these people
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
to go but the ER so funding programs
 
05:58:31.850 --> 05:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
like this takes one more little piece
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
and and really helps a group of people
 
05:58:37.010 --> 05:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
that need help that prevents long-term
 
05:58:40.490 --> 05:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
problems that leads to lower costs in
 
05:58:42.288 --> 05:58:42.298 align:start position:0%
the long run one of the problems of our
 
05:58:44.810 --> 05:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
Patchwork system is that the cost that's
 
05:58:46.670 --> 05:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
get lowered may not be in the same
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program you may save money
 
05:58:51.530 --> 05:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it may be saving money in
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
that this the child of this mother grows
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
up to be a normal person and ends up
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
with a productive life and contributes a
 
05:59:01.190 --> 05:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
lot to society that might not have
 
05:59:03.830 --> 05:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
happened if their mother had driven them
 
05:59:06.288 --> 05:59:06.298 align:start position:0%
off the cliff and a motorcycle because
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
she was depressed so I really do support
 
05:59:10.010 --> 05:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:59:10.020 --> 05:59:11.330 align:start position:0%
this bill
okay

05:59:11.330 --> 05:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:13.610 --> 05:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
05:59:16.850 --> 05:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:59:19.610 --> 05:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm well aware that we have
 
05:59:19.620 --> 05:59:21.948 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm well aware that we have
philosophical

05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
philosophical
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
divides in many respects on this
 
05:59:24.718 --> 05:59:25.670 align:start position:0%
divides in many respects on this
committee

05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:59:25.680 --> 05:59:26.628 align:start position:0%
committee
um

05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:28.850 --> 05:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know I think we probably have
 
05:59:32.570 --> 05:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
disagreement about the um
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
about Universal Health Care or
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
single-payer health care we probably
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
have disagreement about what creates
 
05:59:41.930 --> 05:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
dependence and what um creates
 
05:59:44.150 --> 05:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
self-reliance I know we have
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.718 --> 05:59:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:59:51.830 --> 05:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I thought we had agreement about the
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
importance of children having a strong
 
06:00:00.770 --> 06:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
start in life and strengthening families
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think we do and somebody else referred
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
to well
 
06:00:06.948 --> 06:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think Medicaid should be the
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
answer to everything what about other
 
06:00:11.330 --> 06:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
things to strengthen the families and
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
strengthen children's beginning in life
 
06:00:16.730 --> 06:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
and I would agree wholeheartedly with
 
06:00:18.770 --> 06:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
that that I don't think this is the only
 
06:00:21.948 --> 06:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
solution to build strong families and to
 
06:00:24.548 --> 06:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
give children a chance
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of other ideas and
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
we should be pursuing those ideas as
 
06:00:29.400 --> 06:00:30.350 align:start position:0%
we should be pursuing those ideas as
well

06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:00:33.410 --> 06:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
but I do think this is one very
 
06:00:33.420 --> 06:00:34.670 align:start position:0%
but I do think this is one very
important

06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:00:34.680 --> 06:00:36.048 align:start position:0%
important
um

06:00:36.048 --> 06:00:36.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:38.330 --> 06:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
piece to that puzzle
 
06:00:41.868 --> 06:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
um I think people who um
 
06:00:44.208 --> 06:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
don't have health care at critical times
 
06:00:47.048 --> 06:00:47.058 align:start position:0%
in their development for the mother
 
06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
for the child they don't use Health Care
 
06:00:52.990 --> 06:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
they have less access to Primary Care
 
06:00:56.090 --> 06:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
and this is a critical time to help
 
06:00:59.570 --> 06:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
build strong families and to build
 
06:00:59.580 --> 06:01:00.850 align:start position:0%
build strong families and to build
um

06:01:00.850 --> 06:01:00.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:03.288 --> 06:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
good Beginnings for children starting
 
06:01:05.500 --> 06:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
out in life and so
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
out in life and so
[Music]

06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:06.000 --> 06:01:06.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:09.010 --> 06:01:09.020 align:start position:0%
guess I hope we can put those other
 
06:01:09.020 --> 06:01:10.690 align:start position:0%
guess I hope we can put those other
philosophical

06:01:10.690 --> 06:01:10.700 align:start position:0%
philosophical
 
06:01:14.090 --> 06:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
disagreements aside and do this for
 
06:01:17.448 --> 06:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
families and do this for children and um
 
06:01:20.448 --> 06:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
will it incentivize people to have
 
06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
lots of babies quickly I I don't I don't
 
06:01:25.970 --> 06:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
think so but I don't really know and I
 
06:01:27.288 --> 06:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
don't really want to get into a
 
06:01:30.770 --> 06:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
discussion about that I want to do
 
06:01:32.990 --> 06:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
everything we can to support
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
strong families and um and children who
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
are beginning their lives will it
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
possibly create some dependence
 
06:01:44.690 --> 06:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I certainly couldn't argue I've
 
06:01:46.250 --> 06:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
certainly worked with a lot of people in
 
06:01:48.850 --> 06:01:48.860 align:start position:0%
my career who were dependent on
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
government subsidies I realize that
 
06:01:53.510 --> 06:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's a problem but I don't think
 
06:01:56.570 --> 06:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's the priority here the priority is
 
06:02:00.170 --> 06:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
getting people off to a decent start in
 
06:02:02.810 --> 06:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
life thank you one or two more questions
 
06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
and then I clearly this is the toughest
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
Bill we've dealt with representative
 
06:02:06.120 --> 06:02:06.948 align:start position:0%
Bill we've dealt with representative
King

06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
King
 
06:02:09.470 --> 06:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman McDonald I'd
 
06:02:11.570 --> 06:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
like to address something representative
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh Palmer mentioned with all the respect
 
06:02:15.890 --> 06:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
I disagree with one thing and I think
 
06:02:18.230 --> 06:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative politsov would probably
 
06:02:20.810 --> 06:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
be in a good position to attest to the
 
06:02:24.470 --> 06:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
fact that in many countries uh where you
 
06:02:27.410 --> 06:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
know all their medical care is provided
 
06:02:30.170 --> 06:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
the reason why they're they're not being
 
06:02:32.208 --> 06:02:32.218 align:start position:0%
over utilized is because the care is so
 
06:02:33.890 --> 06:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
bad they know that going to the hospital
 
06:02:36.590 --> 06:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
means death so um there's a lot of
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
places where you might get free health
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
care but that means really really really
 
06:02:42.350 --> 06:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
bad Care number one number two
 
06:02:43.730 --> 06:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at a lot of countries
 
06:02:46.010 --> 06:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people have promoted over
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
the years like Canada as like the the
 
06:02:51.770 --> 06:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
Nirvana of socialized medicine and now
 
06:02:53.090 --> 06:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
we're getting the point where it is in
 
06:02:55.610 --> 06:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
such disarray euthanasia is really
 
06:02:57.048 --> 06:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
starting to kick off not just in Canada
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
but in the Netherlands and other places
 
06:02:58.680 --> 06:03:00.048 align:start position:0%
but in the Netherlands and other places
so

06:03:00.048 --> 06:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's what's happening is they
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
are they are running short on nurses
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a huge nursing Supply crisis
 
06:03:08.150 --> 06:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
there so just shoehorning more and more
 
06:03:09.890 --> 06:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
people into the government if you hate
 
06:03:12.470 --> 06:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
people do that that's my last statement
 
06:03:14.448 --> 06:03:14.458 align:start position:0%
thank you my last question last comment
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative primer
 
06:03:18.890 --> 06:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so the countries that I was talking
 
06:03:21.048 --> 06:03:21.058 align:start position:0%
about are first world countries that
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
have really excellent Medical Care
 
06:03:25.850 --> 06:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
and I think if we're going to go further
 
06:03:27.530 --> 06:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
down this what we need to do is get some
 
06:03:30.350 --> 06:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
statistics to back our stories up and we
 
06:03:34.010 --> 06:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
could go on for hours on this but
 
06:03:35.750 --> 06:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you it's clearly the most
 
06:03:37.548 --> 06:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
difficult Bill we built with that what
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do at this time is called a
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
brief Republican caucus for about 15
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
minutes I think we could all use a
 
06:03:46.910 --> 06:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of a break and we'll be back
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
back at 3 20. uh 3 20. was that yep
 
06:03:53.510 --> 06:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds right
 
06:03:53.520 --> 06:06:34.128 align:start position:0%
that sounds right

I'm not sure quite the order you want to
 
06:19:48.830 --> 06:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
vote on this but uh what I would like to
 
06:19:56.410 --> 06:19:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:00.590 --> 06:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
202304h all zero three zero four h does
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
was when we heard the bill we were told
 
06:20:07.128 --> 06:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
that there had been a reenactment of the
 
06:20:10.368 --> 06:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
statute that we were operating under and
 
06:20:13.368 --> 06:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
this gets the right Statute in the right
 
06:20:15.730 --> 06:20:15.740 align:start position:0%
section and we'd had an earlier
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
effort with that amendment that came out
 
06:20:21.288 --> 06:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
in an amended section one incident of
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
section two I had the amendment that I'm
 
06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposing now
 
06:20:27.650 --> 06:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
properly amend section two
 
06:20:29.208 --> 06:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:30.830 --> 06:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay well it's usually appropriate to
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
take up an amendment first okay so
 
06:20:35.868 --> 06:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
so you're moving that Amendment so I
 
06:20:37.850 --> 06:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
would move Amendment zero three zero
 
06:20:39.948 --> 06:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
four h and
 
06:20:43.970 --> 06:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I would state that all it does is
 
06:20:46.250 --> 06:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I I haven't passed it out I will
 
06:20:49.190 --> 06:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
pass it out if you'd like it but all it
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
does and I'm anticipating a certain
 
06:20:54.890 --> 06:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
result with this vote
 
06:20:54.900 --> 06:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
result with this vote
um

06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
all it does is amend
 
06:21:04.850 --> 06:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
the line on line three and four it's
 
06:21:07.610 --> 06:21:07.620 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
um looking into this I saw that
 
06:26:06.470 --> 06:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
um Physicians assistants within their
 
06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
scope of practice are already authorized
 
06:26:10.970 --> 06:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
to prescribe drugs and devices for
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
advanced practice nurses they're
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
authorized to prescribe therapeutic
 
06:26:17.930 --> 06:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
measures and in everything that I've
 
06:26:20.030 --> 06:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
seen therapeutic measures includes drugs
 
06:26:22.310 --> 06:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
and devices it's one of those areas
 
06:26:24.170 --> 06:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
where the citizen legislature didn't
 
06:26:26.208 --> 06:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
Define that well but I see no
 
06:26:28.910 --> 06:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
limitations on that currently I
 
06:26:30.890 --> 06:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate I appreciate representative
 
06:26:33.470 --> 06:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
leckis trying to find an area where
 
06:26:35.570 --> 06:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
practice has been constrained but
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately it looks like this is not a
 
06:26:39.170 --> 06:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
problem so we can we can move in
 
06:26:41.810 --> 06:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate representative
 
06:26:44.030 --> 06:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:26:46.970 --> 06:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I went to the street to
 
06:26:48.830 --> 06:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
answer this question but my wife's a
 
06:26:50.750 --> 06:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner I work with about 20
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants they can already
 
06:26:56.390 --> 06:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
write for orthopedic shoes they can
 
06:26:58.548 --> 06:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
write for braces they can write for all
 
06:27:00.590 --> 06:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
sorts of durable medical things so um
 
06:27:02.510 --> 06:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is actually already covered and and
 
06:27:06.048 --> 06:27:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%

representative Merchant
 
06:27:13.070 --> 06:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think I'm talking to people what I
 
06:27:15.230 --> 06:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
have found out it's not so much the
 
06:27:17.090 --> 06:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
question of writing the prescriptions a
 
06:27:19.250 --> 06:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
reimbursement issue
 
06:27:19.260 --> 06:27:21.650 align:start position:0%

representative just about the process
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
the bills that we
 
06:30:47.940 --> 06:30:48.530 align:start position:0%
the bills that we
um

06:30:48.530 --> 06:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:50.410 --> 06:30:50.420 align:start position:0%
deferred from today
 
06:30:52.850 --> 06:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
can we hear them tomorrow even though
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're not noticed
 
06:30:57.230 --> 06:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's we're continuing them until
 
06:31:00.110 --> 06:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and there was the continuing
 
06:31:01.910 --> 06:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
notice in the calendar that said that
 
06:31:05.090 --> 06:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
they were continued from today over till
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so I think that does satisfy
 
06:31:08.160 --> 06:31:09.708 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so I think that does satisfy
okay

06:31:09.708 --> 06:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:31:12.650 --> 06:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
it was it was clear that there was this
 
06:31:13.970 --> 06:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
whole chunk and we were going to bite
 
06:31:15.650 --> 06:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
off as much as we could chew today and
 
06:31:18.110 --> 06:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
then the rest of them flowed over to the
 
06:31:20.390 --> 06:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow bucket I just didn't want us to
 
06:31:23.150 --> 06:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
get in trouble it's addendum 10B okay to
 
06:31:25.250 --> 06:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
the calendar yeah
 
06:31:29.170 --> 06:31:29.180 align:start position:0%

06:31:34.190 --> 06:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
